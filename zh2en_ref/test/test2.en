State of Emergency Ends ; Palestinian Prime Minister Fayyad to Set up New Government 
Today is the end of the one - month state of emergency implemented by the Palestinian Authority after Hamas militants attacked and occupied the Gaza Strip . Prime Minister Fayyad tendered resignation temporarily , but was thereupon tasked with responsibility for setting up a new government . 
Agriculture and Social Affairs Minister Habash told AFP , " Prime Minister Fayyad submitted his written resignation to President Abbas . The president accepted it and at the same time asked him to set up a new cabinet government with responsibility for handling daily affairs . " 
Abbas confidant Amr told AFP that Fayyad had submitted his written resignation , but Abbas ordered him to " execute his current duties until he sets up a new government . " 
The submission of a written resignation by Fayyad , a much respected economist , was only a procedural resignation and will not affect his prime minister status . 
Fayyad started leading the Palestinian emergency cabinet from the 17th of last month , with responsibility for executing the state of emergency order announced by Abbas after Hamas violently attacked and occupied Gaza . 
According to the constitution of the Palestinian autonomous government , a state of emergency cannot exceed 30 days without parliamentary approval . However , the autonomous parliament is now paralyzed . 
The authority of the emergency government ends today . 
WTO Representatives Raise New Proposals ; Hope of Breaking Stalemate in the Doha Round of Talks 
With the hope of breaking the stalemate in the Doha Round of trade talks , key WTO negotiation representatives today proposed a large cut in farm subsidies by the US and a sharp reduction in industrial product import tariffs by developing countries . 
An official said that the new " draft model " demands that the US reduce its annual farm subsidies from the current allowed amount of US $ 19 billion to US $ 16.2 billion , and for developing countries to adjust industrial product import tariffs down to less than 23 % . 
These proposals aim to break the almost six years of stalemate in the Doha Round of talks , and to help the 150 WTO members come to a compromise agreement . 
WTO Secretary Lamy called these proposals " a fair and reasonable foundation for concluding a balanced and development - oriented agreement that has ambitious goals . " 
Lamy said , " Member countries will not be completely satisfied with the content of the proposals , but currently there are fewer problems concerning differences than problems creating consensus . " 
He called for intensive talks to be held in the next few weeks . 
Strong Quake Affects Parts Production ; Japanese Automotive Plants Reduce or Stop Production 
Japan was hit with a strong earthquake this week , causing a shortage in automotive parts . Automakers such as Toyota and Nissan said today that they would scale back production , even suspending domestic car production . 
Japan was hit with a strong 6.8 Richter magnitude earthquake two days ago . Automotive parts manufacturer Riken was forced to suspend operation of its factory in northwest Tokyo , which then impacted production of automotive plants . 
Toyota will suspend domestic car production from tonight until the 21st , said a spokeswoman from Toyota , the world 's top - selling automaker . 
Nissan spokesperson Nakagawa said that from the day after tomorrow to the 23rd , two out of three Nissan plants in Japan would suspend some production operations , and the situation will be reassessed during the weekend .

Suzuki Auto said that it would partially suspend production for three days starting tomorrow . Japan 's Fuji Heavy Industries , which produces Subaru vehicles , will also suspend production of small cars starting tomorrow and assess the situation on the 21st .

Indonesia Cancels Sale of British Eco - friendly Branded Bag Due to Worries over Chaotic Buying Stampede 
Agents said today that Indonesia has cancelled sale activities for the British eco - friendly branded bag , in view of the chaos triggered by a wave of buying stampede in Hong Kong earlier this month . 
The manager of branded shop " On Pedder " located in the upscale Plaza Indonesia said , " We cancelled the market launch for the eco - friendly bag in view of what happened in Hong Kong . 
It 's not worth it if people are fighting over a 140,000 rupiah ( about NT $ 494 ) bag . " 
Thousands of Hong Kong people gathered outside sale stores on the 6th , ready to rush to buy the limited quantity eco - friendly bag designed by British designer Anya Hindmarch , printed " I 'm Not A Plastic Bag . " However , the stores refused to open their doors , causing the situation to become chaotic . 
This fine product calling for eco - friendliness is trying to replace plastic bags , but unexpectedly became an overnight fashion icon in London and New York , triggering a buying stampede , with prices on the eBay auction website already skyrocketing to several times the retail price . 
" On Pedder , " the only authorized seller in Indonesia , expressed uncertainty whether to start selling in a few days . 
Hostage Crisis Countdown ; South Korea and Taliban Negotiate Directly 
The Afghani Taliban have kidnapped 23 South Korean hostages and set as a final deadline sunset today , demanding that South Korea withdraw its troops from Afghanistan , or they will kill the hostages . 
With minutes and seconds going by , the situation saw a positive development with South Korean officials launching talks with the Taliban today for the first time . 
Yet at the same time , the Taliban said that a German who had also been kidnapped was very weak physically , had started slipping into a coma , and had lost consciousness . 
The Taliban calls for Germany and South Korea to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan , and demands 33 guerrillas imprisoned by the Afghan government in exchange for these hostages . 
Taliban spokesperson Ahmadi said in a telephone interview with AFP from an unknown location , " We have come in direct contact with the South Korean representatives through tribal elders . " 
" We hope the talks this time will achieve results , " said Ahmadi . 
The Taliban set as a final deadline nightfall , local time ( 10 : 30pm Taiwan time ) , at which point they will start killing the South Korean hostages . 
The guerrillas have already extended their deadline twice . 
Consensus on Sea Conflict Tough to Reach ; Military Talks between Two Koreas End on Bad Terms 
The three - day high - level military talks between the two Koreas , South Korea and North Korea , ended on bad terms today , as a result of each side sticking to its own views regarding marking the sea border . 
The talks , held in the border city of Panmunjom , today entered the last day on the agenda . North Korea 's chief delegate Lieutenant General Kim Yong - chol ( transliterated ) said , " We concluded that we no longer need these fruitless talks . " 
Kim Yong - chol , obviously displeased with a flushed face , attacked South Korea for deliberately avoiding the discussion of drawing a new sea border to replace the existing " Northern Limit Line . " 
He pointed out that the " Northern Limit Line " is not legitimate . 
Located in the Yellow Sea , the " Northern Limit Line " was drawn by the US military in 1953 when the Korean War ended . However , it has become a focus of dispute between the two Koreas in recent years , with North Korea even unwilling to recognize it . 
North Korea said that South Korea 's warships have entered its territorial waters illegally , triggering a tense situation ; South Korea claimed this accusation to be groundless . 
A conflict broke out in the local waters in June 1999 , causing dozens of North Korean crew members to lose their lives . 
A similar clash occurred again in June 2002 , with six South Koreans sadly killed . 
US Treasury Secretary Arrives in China for Visit ; Environmental Protection and Exchange Rate are Main Points of Concern 
US Treasury Secretary Paulson arrived in China yesterday for a visit . The US is currently making full efforts to convince China to further implement necessary economic reforms and environmental protection work , in particular the Renminbi exchange rate issue that has received a lot of attention . 
A US diplomat said that Paulson first went to visit Xining city , capital of Qinghai , a large province in northwest China . 
China is currently implementing a series of environmental protection programs near the largest salt - water lake in Qinghai . 
Paulson moved on to Beijing today , discussing with Chinese leading officials such topics as advancing the course of the " US - China Strategic Economic Dialogue " launched last year . 
The " US - China Strategic Economic Dialogue " mainly discusses topics such as the economy and environmental protection , though most important is the Renminbi exchange rate issue . US congressional representatives think that the Renminbi is excessively undervalued . 
The US - China trade deficit is currently seeing a rapid , sharp increase . Pressure in the US is gradually increasing , with congressional representatives ready to take retaliatory action to oppose their so - called unfair trade policies of China . 
Last week , the US Senate Finance Committee passed a motion by an overwhelming vote requesting the Treasury Department to identify a list of countries whose exchange rate is in " fundamental misalignment , " opening the door to potentially imposing economic sanctions against Beijing . 
US congressional representatives say that the undervalued Renminbi makes goods sold from China to the US very cheap , aggravating the US - China trade imbalance . The US trade deficit with China last year reached US $ 232.5 billion . 
Mourinho Claims He Will Stay at Chelsea and Leave Soccer World Completely Before Age 60 
Since the beginning of the season , Mourinho 's future at Chelsea has been a hot topic for the media . However , as before , the Portuguese once again stressed that he will definitely stay in west London this summer . 
" Some newspapers listed 14 new candidates to lead Chelsea , but I am going to stay at Chelsea , " said Mourinho with sarcasm . 
Mourinho reiterated that one day he hopes he can become coach of the Portuguese team . " I really want very much to coach the national team . I believe there will be a day when the Portuguese Football Federation also hopes very much to engage me as the leader of the national team . " 
However , the 44 - year - old Mourinho does not plan to devote his whole life to soccer . He said he would retire before 60 years old , that he does not want to work until 70 years old like Bobby Robson and Sir Ferguson . 
" I have promised my wife that I will not be like Robson and Ferguson , who kept coaching until 70 years old . " 
Mourinho said frankly , " I want to leave the soccer world completely when I reach 60 . 
I have too many things which I cannot do now waiting for me to do . " 
" I do not want to become a soccer consultant or technical director like Valdano or Sagi . 
I do not want to play this kind of role . 
I do not want to become the president of a club . I just want to say goodbye to soccer completely , " stressed Mourinho .

F1 " Spy Case " Hearing Concluded Yesterday ; McLaren Temporarily Escapes Punishment 
A special hearing called by the FIA World Motor Sport Council for the Ferrari technology spy case came to a close in Paris yesterday evening , Beijing time . The McLaren team that had been summoned escaped suffering : the council decided not to penalize McLaren for the time being . 
After the hearing , the official FIA website issued a statement saying , " The Vodafone McLaren Mercedes team was in possession of confidential Ferrari information , but there is currently insufficient evidence to prove that this information was improperly used for the FIA Formula One World Championship . We 'll therefore impose no penalty . " 
However , the Ferrari technology spy case does not end with this . 
In this decision , the World Motor Sport Council also said , " If it is found in the future that relevant Ferrari information has been used to the detriment of the championship , we reserve the right to call McLaren back to a World Motor Sport Council hearing , where they could face punishment of disqualification from not only the 2007 season , but also the 2008 season . " 
Former McLaren chief designer Mike Coughlan , who is now suspended , was found with almost 800 pages of Ferrari technology documents containing a series of links to Ferrari 's 2007 race cars , including design , power , construction , inspection , testing , development , and operation . 
McLaren insists that no other people on the team knew about this information before Coughlan was suspended , and that McLaren 's race cars this season have no Ferrari elements .

Experts Believe : QDII Insurers Will Not Divert Domestic Stock Market Capital in Near Future 
Chinanews.com , July 30 
According to a China Securities Journal report , with the introduction of the Provisional Measures for Administration of Outbound Investment of Insurance Funds a few days ago , insurance funds have more space to utilize the capital markets . 
Liu Lefei , chief investment officer of China Life Insurance Co . Ltd . , believes that with Renminbi appreciation and positive trends in domestic capital markets , insurance institutions in the near future will not make large - scale overseas investments with foreign exchange purchases . This also indicates that QDII insurers will not divert domestic stock market capital in the near future . 
The report said that many insurance institutions share the same view . 
Experts believe that as there is currently no market for Renminbi derivatives , insurance institutions have insufficient means of avoiding risk . As a result , it is not time yet for large - scale foreign exchange purchases . 
Liu Lefei said that in terms of capital allocation , outbound investment should make up a certain ratio of overall allocations for insurance companies in the long run . 
However , in view of relatively strong pressure for Renminbi appreciation at present , China Life will mainly use its own foreign exchange funds for outbound investments . 
Foreign exchange purchases for outbound investment should be handled carefully under the current situation .

He claimed he hopes that this phenomenon does not exist in Taiwan , but that it might be very difficult . 
In response to Chen Shuibian 's questioning , Taiwanese " Judicial Yuan President " Weng Yueh - sheng kept a low profile and did not respond . " Secretary - General " Fan Kuang - chun , on the other hand , assigned Kao Chin - chih to speak on behalf of the " Judicial Yuan . " 
Kao Chin - chih said that both the Taiwanese constitution and the " Judges ' Rules " proclaim in writing that judges must be nonpartisan , cannot participate in political party activities , and cannot assist in elections ; judges abide by the relevant restrictions very carefully . The " Judicial Yuan " believes the judges are all doing a good job . 
Kao Chin - chih gave an example , noting that Judge Jang Shenq - shii of Kaohsiung " Branch High Court " participated a few years ago in a course conducted by the Ketagalan School , and was punished because the course was tainted by a political party . The punishment resolution was by a self - disciplinary committee composed of judges . 
Jang Shenq - shii once wanted to take part in DPP primary elections , and eventually decided to give up because there was controversy over his election participation while working . 
Kao Chin - chih thinks that if the ruling of an individual case can be appealed to a higher court for relief , it cannot be inferred that a judge has political motives based only on whether the ruling is a win or a loss . 
Germany Plans to Lower Barriers for Bringing in Specialized Skilled Workers 
Staff report , Berlin , July 1 ( Correspondent Wang Huaicheng ) 
German Education and Research Minister Schavan said a few days ago that Germany should lower the Immigration Law restrictions on bringing in foreign specialized skilled workers , using an introduction of foreign talent to solve Germany 's specialized skilled worker shortage problems . 
According to an OECD report , by 2010 , Germany 's labor force between 15 and 64 years old will be shrinking yearly . 
Without enough immigrants , Germany 's labor force by 2020 will be 6 % smaller than now . 
However , reports from organizations such as the Federation of German Employers ' Associations and the Association for German Engineers show that there is a relatively large shortage in the current German labor market for engineers and specialized technology workers . 
According to data from the German Federal Labor Agency , the German labor market had a supply shortage of about 12,700 engineers and a supply shortage of about 9,600 technicians in May of this year . 
Germany has set high barriers for the introduction of foreign skilled workers in order to protect local employment . 
Germany 's Immigration Law states that specialized skilled workers from non - EU countries cannot earn less than 85,500 euros per year in Germany , or else cannot obtain German work and residency permits . 
Schavan proposed bringing this limit down to between 40,000 and 60,000 euros . 
Don 't Believe Blindly in the " Theoretical Field " of Law 
Clause 8 of the revised draft of the Law on Lawyers , which was recently submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress for review , states : Those who have undertaken specialized work such as legal research or teaching and had a high - level title or the equivalent , upon application to become a lawyer can be allowed to practice law after examination and verification by the State Council 's judicial administrative department . 
( June 28 , China Youth Daily ) 
In law , there is the " theoretical field " and the " practical field . " The former mainly includes " abstract actions " such as legal teaching and research work , while the latter undertakes more " concrete actions " such as litigation , legal consultation , and legal services . 
For a long time , " intellectual disparagement " has existed between the " theoretical field " and " practical field " of law . The " theoretical field " thinks that the " practical field " lacks necessary accomplishment in the law and are only mechanical " legalists " ; meanwhile , the response of the " practical field " to criticism by the " theoretical field " is " theory cannot guide practice . " 
Concerning this kind of division of labor gap , what the law can do is stay neutral instead of giving strong support to either side . 
However , the " specially licensed lawyer system " in the Law on Lawyers objectively recognizes a judgment that the law 's " theoretical field " is above the law 's " practical field . " 
The fact is that some experts and scholars who are engaged in researching and teaching of pure legal theory , such as history of the legal system and international law , do not fit with practical law regardless of their depth of theoretical attainment . 
In this way , for the law 's " practical field , " the " specially licensed lawyer system " no doubt opens a " bad door " which very negatively influences chaos in qualifications . 
This is not the only blind belief about the " theoretical field . " The phenomenon of expert opinions and expert panel discussions frequently influencing and even overruling court rulings is another direct manifestation of this kind of blind belief .

Staff report , Correspondent Feng Lei

Britain Lowers Terrorist Attack Threat Level 
Staff Report , London , July 5 ( Correspondent Guo Lin ) 
The British government lowered its terrorist attack threat level from the highest to " severe " on the 4th , meaning there will not be a terrorist attack in Britain soon but an attack is still " highly possible . " 
Currently , the British police is turning its investigation scope on India and Australia . 
As the eight terrorist attack suspects arrested all worked in the medical system , the government will carry out emergency checks on the background of foreign immigrants who work in the medical system . 
According to the information , nearly 90,000 people working in the British public medical system all obtained their medical qualifications overseas . 
Prime Minister Brown also requested investigations on the background of high - tech immigration applicants , and employers or relevant organizations will be asked to provide background information of the applicants . 
Do Not Let Peddlers Spoil Public Places 
When out on a trip , one wants to feel relaxed , refreshed , and free , enjoying to the utmost the fruits of natural scenery and society 's civilization . 
However , many people encounter this kind of vexation when traveling domestically : being chased and intercepted by peddlers and middlemen in public places . 
Whether on autos or trains , boarding or alighting , there are constant entanglements with small peddlers and some unlicensed middlemen . 
If they are not selling eggs , peanuts , or sesame seed cakes , they are selling newspapers and magazines . There are also many unlicensed middlemen introducing restaurants and hotels , even peddling fake certificates and fake receipts , among other things . 
If you do not accept , he can chase you for a few hundred meters , like someone ready to die for a just cause in the face of failure . 
At some scenic spots , many tourists also have the same feeling . 
Prior to entering the main gate , people come to peddle things like travel souvenirs and small crafts . 
After entering , there is more of this kind of situation . No matter how good your mood , you will be bothered to the point of losing interest . 
Media have reported that many foreign tourists in Xi 'an sing endless praise for the scenic spots and historic sites of Xi 'an , but cannot understand why masses of small peddlers and hawkers are allowed to sell everywhere . 
Public places including bus stations and scenic spots are at root places for trips and relaxation . They should be civilized , orderly , quiet , harmonious , providing tourists a comfortable and relaxed environment . 
Peddlers ' freedom to come and go not only affects the mood of tourists , it also destroys the public order of these public places on an objective level , bringing about visual pollution and environmental pollution . At the same time , it also gives lawless people the condition and opportunity for creating trouble . 
The important thing is , these public places are windows onto the development of local spiritual civilization . One can deduce much from little information . It is not only the image that suffers , as local economic development will be influenced as well . 
Just think , you want to make the tourism industry bigger and stronger , but use this kind of chaotic tourism environment to welcome guests from near and far . Who still wants to come ? Who dares to come ? 
How can your tourism economy obtain beneficial results ? 
With the coming of the peak travel season , it should be said that creating a civilized travel environment for tourists from near and far is an urgent matter . 
Public places are not markets . The operating behavior of small peddlers and hawkers should be standardized . Put a firm stop to unlicensed operations , staunchly crack down on illegal activities . 
Only a civilized and orderly environment can let tourists come happily , leave satisfied , and return with excitement . 
In short , do not let peddlers spoil public places . 
" Rewarding Self - Initiated Exit from Subsistence Allowances " Does not Pass Muster 
The Jianguomen neighborhood in Dongcheng District , Beijing , gave items such as refrigerators as a reward to 12 poor families who exited from subsistence allowances on their own initiative . 
( Beijing News , July 10 ) 
This writer feels happy for the improved lives of these families , but has mixed feelings about the phrase " self - initiated exit from subsistence allowances , " and the practice of " giving rewards . " 
An assistant director of the Jianguomen neighborhood said , " In light of problems like cheating on subsistence allowances , encouraging the self - initiated exit from subsistence allowances sets an example for other poor families . " 
This example is indeed worth promoting if it encourages other poor people to get out of their predicaments through one 's own hard work ; it is really somewhat na ? ve if it is thought this will " inspire " those people who have fraudulently received subsistence allowances for a long time . 
When differentiating and straightening out real and fake poor families , what should be relied on more is the law . 
Relevant departments should strengthen the obligations that must be met for poor families to enjoy subsistence allowances : such as immediately reporting changes in family members ' incomes , reporting employment situation , and accepting regular reviews . Meanwhile , relevant departments should increase the strength of supervision and investigation . 
In the end , " exit from subsistence allowance according to the law " is the long - term solution . 
Who pays when the neighborhood gives material rewards to families who exit from subsistence allowance ? 
As a first - level governmental organization , a neighborhood has its expenses covered by financial allocations . 
However , should this taxpayer money be spent ? 
On the one hand , families who exit from subsistence allowances prove that they already have a certain " self - sufficient " capacity ; on the other hand , aren 't there still people who are applying for subsistence allowances ? 
Government financial allocations , which is called a lifeline , should provide timely help rather than reward good fortune . 
Liu Gangyi Willing to be a Service Provider ; This is a More Convincing Statement 
On July 10 , Chengdu City Xindu District Mulan Town Party Committee Secretary Liu Gangyi , the first town party committee secretary in the country to be directly elected by the public , received his fourth review since taking office , achieving a satisfaction rate of 97 % . 
Liu Gangyi positioned himself as a " service provider " during a conversation between this correspondent and Liu Gangyi . 
( Yesterday , Beijing News ) 
" Service provider " in the words of Liu Gangyi may be more real , more convincing than " service provider " in the words of some appointed cadres . 
The biggest advantage of being directly elected by the public compared to appointment is that for the former , determination of power mainly originates with ordinary party members and the public , whereas for the latter , nominations are mainly by superior organizations . Therefore , direction of the power source determines that with the former , responsibility to the public must be given top priority . 
The source of power , and to whom one owes responsibility , are basic elements that determine how elected people carry out their work . 
Some people question whether such " democratic review " is more like a " democracy show . " 
My opinion is , having this kind of " democratic review " format is better than nothing . 
Considering the history and current situation of China 's grassroots democratic political development , I think direct election by the public is already a major breakthrough . Democratic review is an important component of this pioneering work , and should not be underestimated in promoting grassroots democratic political development . 
Optimism in India for Electing First Female President ; Analysts Claim Relatively High Possibility of Election Victory ; Female Voters Hope This Improves Status of Women 
On June 23 , Patil clasped her hands together before filling out the presidential candidate documents . 
India 's presidential election kicked off on the 19th , with the new president to be elected from between Shekhawat , the current vice president , and Pratibha Patil , the recently resigned governor of Rajasthan state . 
Patil is the first female presidential candidate in the history of India . If she is elected , she will become the first female president in India 's history . 
Patil is the presidential candidate for the governing Congress Party , whereas Shekhawat comes from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party . 
Since the Congress Party has an advantage in the presidential electoral college , the media and public largely guess that the possibility of a Patil victory is higher . 
Patil , who is 72 years old this year , was Rajasthan 's female governor . 
She started out as a lawyer , entering parliament in 1985 . With abundant political work experience , she received high opinions from the government when governor of Rajasthan . 
She has also dedicated herself for social welfare , as honorary chairwoman for many cultural , educational , and social welfare organizations . 
Analysts note that Patil became a candidate as a result of her unswerving loyalty to Sonia Ghandi , president of India 's Congress Party . 
In India , the Ghandi family has been controlling the governing Congress Party for a long time . 
Patil has received many female voters ' support . Female voters believe that in India where there is a strong concept of discrimination against women , Patil will remold the image of women and raise the status of women . 
The constitution stipulates that the president of India , a federal country , is the country 's leader and commander - in - chief of the armed forces in name , without representing any party or organization . It is more of a symbol .

US Supports Pakistani Government in Driving out Extremists 
Staff Report , Washington , July 22 ( Correspondent Xu Qisheng ) 
US President Bush said on the 21st that the United States will give full support to the Pakistani government in driving " al - Qaeda " and Taliban extremists away from the Pakistan - Afghanistan border area . 
In his weekly routine radio address on the same day , Bush said that according to the new information of the United States , " al - Qaeda " has found a " safe haven " at the Pakistan - Afghanistan border area for hiding . 
He expressed " a lot of concern " over this . 
Bush said that the United States will continue to support Pakistani President Musharraf , and he believes Musharraf will persist in his fight against " al - Qaeda " and Taliban militants . 
The National Intelligence Estimate report published by the United States recently said that Muslim militant groups , especially Bin Laden 's " al - Qaeda , " are still a continuous threat to the United States . 
The agreement reached in September last year between Musharraf and some tribe leaders in the northern districts of Pakistan on preventing activities of Taliban 's remaining power and " al - Qaeda " members did not achieve its anticipated effect . 
These tribe leaders " are not willing or have no ability " to protect their districts ' safety on their own . 
In this pre - recorded address , Bush said Musharraf is currently taking active steps in correcting this mistake .

Hill , US assistant secretary of state and chief US representative to the six - party talks on the North Korean nuclear issue , said on the 23rd that the six - party talks on the North Korean nuclear issue held last week was very important .

Weather Changes Cause Alps Glaciers to Shrink Rapidly 
Staff Report , Geneva , July 29 ( Correspondent Liu Jun ) 
From their long - term trace study , glacier experts from Swiss Academy of Sciences found that more than 1,800 Swiss glaciers were shrinking at a speed of 3 % every year on average between 1850 and 2005 . 
The heat wave in 2003 alone melted 1.8 % of the Alps glaciers . 
Experts believe that by 2100 , glaciers will shrink by 80 % compared to now if the global temperature goes up by 3 degrees Celsius ; all glaciers will dissolve if it goes up by 5 degrees Celsius . 
The Aletsch glacier is Europe 's longest glacier , and was named a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site . However , it shrunk 100 meters within one year between 2005 and 2006 . It has come to a stage where the natural environment must be protected right away . 
The picture shows the 23 - kilometer Aletsch glacier .

The Ringing of the Alarm Bell at this Moment " Connects " Hong Kong with the Rest of the World in a Joint Celebration of 10 Years Since the Handover 
On July 1 , the alarm bell at Jinghai temple memorial hall in Nanjing was once again struck and rung with a melodious resound . 
This echo of profound historical significance " connected " the Mainland and Hong Kong through television ; citizens of Nanjing and their fellow countrymen in Hong Kong " shared this moment with the entire world " together celebrating the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong 's handover to the motherland . 
At midnight on July 1 ten years ago , the air above the bell tower at Jinghai temple memorial in Nanjing reverberated to the sounds of one hundred and fifty-five strikes of the alarm bell . It was saying adieu to the humiliating history of the cession of Hong Kong Island . 
Outside the entrance to the small memorial hall , people from all walks of society in Nanjing gathered together . They said they will use their own two hands to strike this alarm bell , to warn themselves and later generations never to forget history . 
The alarm bell is 1.842 meters high and it was in 1842 that the " Nanjing Treaty " was signed , right at the time the Opium War broke out . 
The shoulder of the bell is 1.997 meters high and 1997 is the year of the Hong Kong handover . 
The planner and founder of the alarm bell that year , Wang Fengling , explained , " Five rows of the character ' Ten Thousand ' encircle the body of the bell . The entire bronze bell uses high relief sculpture and two dragons support a ball of fire which symbolizes that Hong Kong is the motherland 's ' Pearl of the Orient . ' Finally , the flower of Nanjing city , plum blossom , is the figure on the bell 's strikeplate . " 
The first member of the Democracy Party that year to propose making the alarm bell , Yu Xiaodong , said emotionally , " Before I realized it , it is already ten years since Hong Kong 's return . " He hopes that Hong Kong 's tomorrow can be like the sound of the bell , " bright and long , and stretching forever without end . "

Russian Security Bureau Charges Exiled Oligarch Berezovksy with " Secretly Initiating a Political Coup " 
On July 2 , Borovkov , lawyer of the Russian oligarch Berezovsky exiled in London , announced that the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation has made a new formal charge accusing his client Berezovksky of " secretly planning a national political coup and attempting to violently take over Russian political authority . " 
Borovkov pointed out that in April this year , in an interview with a reporter from the British The Guardian , Berezovsky announced that he was prepared to initiate a " palace revolution " in Russia and confirmed that he provided financial support to the right wing elite representatives opposing the policies of the party in power . 
Following this , the Investigation Office of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation launched a criminal investigation against Berezovsky according to article 278 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation , " seizing power through violence . " In the last few days they formally lodged a corresponding indictment with Moscow 's Savyolovsky court . 
Reports say that in February 2006 the Russian Federation Chief Prosecutors Office issued a criminal indictment against Berezovsky on the same premise that the exiled oligarch confirmed in an interview that he planned to take over political power in Russia by force . 
Since Berezovsky has continuously been exiled abroad and could not be extradited , in January 2007 the Russians temporarily terminated investigation of this case . 
On July 2 , Russia 's Savyolovsky court commenced hearing another criminal case against the exiled oligarch . The Russian Chief Prosecutors Office accused Berezovsky of embezzling 214 million Rubles from Aeroflot and laundering 16 million Rubles . After hearing the evidence the court decided to adjourn until July 12 when they will launch a court investigation . In the meantime , they will assign a state defense attorney to the accused . 
Berezovsky believes this is all a " farce " and categorically forbids his defense attorney from taking part in the hearing .

Guangxi must further perfect and standardize codes of practice for each item of administrative management , build a complete administrative efficiency monitoring work system and safeguarding mechanism , and bring efficiency monitoring on track of systemization and standardization . It must further regulate monitoring and inspection procedures , build a complete complaint handling and performance efficiency evaluation and assessment mechanism , and significantly increase accountability efforts by using a strict accountability system to ensure that the initial enquiry responsibility system , the handling formalities within time limits system and other work systems are put fully into practice .

Two Jordanians Sentenced for Plotting to Attack Americans 
Two Jordanian men were sentenced by the Jordan State Security Court on the 11th for plotting an attack on Americans in Jordan . 
Both of them are 25 year old men , one named Sameeh al - Hotari was sentenced to eight years imprisonment and forced labor , the other named Mohammed Shehada was sentenced to three years imprisonment and forced labor . 
Court officials said that al - Hotari was also charged with illegally possessing a firearm . Police discovered a submachine gun when searching his home . 
The court originally decided to sentence al - Hotari to life imprisonment but later reconsidered to give him the opportunity for a " fresh start " and reduced the sentence to eight years . 
The indictment said that after the Iraq war broke out , the two accused decided they must avenge the Muslims who " suffered from being humiliated by Americans , " so they plotted an attack on Americans living in Jordan . 
In August 2006 they locked onto an American living in the suburbs of the Jordanian capital Amman . However , they were arrested by police before carrying out the attack on him . 
The identity of this American was not published in the indictment . 
The indictment also charged the two accused with planning to attack other Americans but did not reveal specific details .

Reports of Adverse Reaction Caused by Diabetes Drug Avandia Increase Greatly in Number 
According to US media reports on the 15th , the number of reports in the USA of heart disease and other adverse reactions caused by the anti - diabetes drug Avandia has recently seen a dramatic rise . 
The US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning in May this year suggesting that diabetes patients use Avandia cautiously , because scientists published a research report in the issue of New England Journal of Medicine published on May 21 that said this blockbuster drug will greatly increase the heart disease incidence rate and death rate of patients . 
As a result , the safety of Avandia came under close scrutiny from doctors and patients . 
Statistics show within around one month of issuing the safety warning , the US FDA received 357 reports of adverse reactions caused by Avandia , of those 38 were fatality reports . 
Whereas in January and February this year , the FDA received only 50 and 73 reports of adverse reactions respectively . 
These adverse reactions were as minor as blistering and as major as sudden cardiac death . 
However , experts at the US FDA believe that now it is still early to arrive at the conclusion that Avandia is unsafe . 
On July 30 , the FDA will hold a hearing concerning the safety of Avandia . 
Introduced to the market in 1999 , Avandia is a kind of insulin sensitizer suitable for the treatment of Type II diabetes . 
In the entire world there are about six million diabetes patients who have taken or are taking Avandia . 
Avandia 's manufacturer , the British GlaxoSmithKline Company , has always considered that Avandia is safe and that for patients " the benefits are greater than the risks . " 
US Wants to Reopen Middle East Peace Talks 
In a Washington speech on the 16th , US President Bush called for an international conference to be held this fall on the Israel - Palestine issue . He invited Israel , Palestine , some of the surrounding Arab states and other concerned nations to participate in order to collectively push ahead a restart of the Middle East peace process . 
On the 17th , Bush also made separate telephone calls to Egyptian President Mubarak , King Abdullah II of Jordan , and King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia , requesting them to respond positively to this proposal by supporting President Abbas of the Palestinian National Authority through practical action and helping Palestine and Israel restore peace talks at an early date .

The meeting will discuss holding early elections for the Palestine National Authority and the Legislative Council , as well as other issues . 
On the same day , Abbas met Solana , the EU 's high representative in charge of foreign and security affairs , at the presidential headquarters in Ramallah . At the joint press conference held afterwards , he said that if the PLO Central Committee makes a corresponding decision , the president will have the authority to issue a " legal and binding " order , and such an order will be issued very soon . 
Meanwhile , Abbas feels satisfied regarding the relationship between the Palestine National Authority and the EU . 
He said that the Palestinians welcome the EU 's understanding of measures taken by the Palestinian presidential headquarters . 
Abbas urged the EU to continue providing humanitarian aid to the Palestinian population in Gaza . 
Solana reaffirmed the EU 's support of Abbas and the Palestinian people . 
He said that the four parties involved in the Middle East issue ( the UN , EU , USA and Russia ) will convene a meeting on the 19th to discuss the issue of restarting the Middle East peace process , and in the next few days proposals may possibly be put forward . 
Solana expressed that the EU maintains a positive stance on deploying international troops to Gaza , but still must discuss it with all other parties , and particularly carry out discussions with the United Nations .

US Department of Defense Reconsiders Plan to Cut American Troops Posted in Europe 
A US Department of Defense official said on the 23rd that due to the Iraq war and the change in the world situation , the U.S . Department of Defense is currently reconsidering its plan , formulated in 2002 , to cut the number of US troops posted in Europe by roughly half . 
US media quoted a Department of Defense official saying , because the Iraq war is still in progress and US relations with Russia and Iran have worsened , those at the leadership level of the Department of Defense questioned the viability of the plan to cut troops posted in Europe . 
In 2002 , the Secretary of Defense at the time , Rumsfeld , announced that before 2012 the US will cut the number of troops posted in Europe from the original 113,000 people to 71,000 people , in order to build a " smaller but superior " new model army . 
At present , the total military strength of the US Army posted in Europe has already been reduced to 100,000 people . 
However , in June this year , Chief of Staff Craddock at US European Command Headquarter submitted a report to the current Secretary of Defense Gates , raising doubts about the abovementioned reduction plan . 
The report said that while the military strength of US troops posted in Europe was being reduced , many of the units were rotated and transferred to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan . This caused a shortfall in US troops posted in Europe and even made it impossible to carry out cooperation with their European allies as normal . 
The report suggested terminating the plan to reduce US troops posted in Europe . 
Associated experts in the United States believe that the above phenomenon indicates that the prolonged delay in resolving the Iraq war has already upset the original adjustment plan of the US troops .

Three Main Functions of Modern Military Uniforms 
One , identification function . 
To distinguish the important insignia of different nations ' armies , different types of soldiers , armies and civilians . 
Among the armies of over 100 large and small nations in the world , although the basic use of a military uniform is the same , the military uniforms of no two countries ' armies are completely the same . 
Two , symbolic function . 
To a certain degree , a military uniform is the image of a nation 's spirit , a reflection of its national characteristics , and is a focused embodiment of a nation 's military capability and its soldiers ' accomplishments . 
In the three main categories of military uniform : ceremonial uniform , service uniform and training uniform , nothing is more capable of fully displaying national and military prestige than a stiff and tight - fitted , handsome - looking ceremonial uniform . 
Three , protective function . 
With the rapid development of new high - technology weapons , improving the overall protective performance of new types of training uniform and making military uniform bullet proof , detection proof , chemical proof , germ proof , radiation proof , as well as having temperature control , moisture control , gas control and various other functions , has become the foremost issue in military uniform development .

Certain Battalion Party Committee Dares to Stick to its Guns to Handle Thorny Problem 
Staff Report , Chengdu , July 3 
Report by Qu Yimao and Yang Ruiyu : " We are able to live in an apartment thanks to the resolve and determination of the Battalion Party Committee to clear out the rooms . " 
Today , more than ten cadres from a communication training battalion in Chengdu Military Command all look very happy as they move to an apartment block . They are full of admiration and appreciation at the style in which " the team " of the Battalion Party Committee dared to stick to their guns and struggle against obstacles to resolve a thorny problem . 
In the last few years , as personnel have been replaced , a portion of this battalion 's apartments in this family dormitory building was over - occupied , contrary to regulations , which made it difficult for cadres in service to find accommodation . Officers and men have expressed considerable objections concerning this matter . 
The battalion also cleared out the apartments several times before , but due to resistance they settled the matter by leaving it unsettled , which turned this issue into a long - standing problem . 
" If only one sticks to one 's guns and is fair and reasonable , there are no unsolvable problems . " 
After the new party committee team achieved consensus , major leaders came out in person to set about completely clearing up all the problems where apartments were occupied contrary to regulations . 
On the one hand , they appealed to people 's emotion and explained through reason , hoping that the people concerned would consider the overall situation ; on the other hand they explained clearly the related policies and regulations on military apartments , pooled housing and economic housing , and made clear the party committee 's determination , resolve and standpoint on principles . 
For some people with housing elsewhere yet unwilling to withdraw from over - occupied housing , the party committee promptly contacted their work unit and took corresponding steps to urge them to actively cooperate with the army 's work . 
After two months of painstaking work , all the residents of buildings on the campgrounds that were over - occupied against regulations moved out on schedule and the serving battalion cadres were allotted housing according to regulations . 
This style in which the Battalion Party Committee dares to stick to its guns and struggle against obstacles also created a domino effect : a few cadres originally unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization 's allocation , now also , one by one , expressed submission to the organization 's decision .

Jingjiang City People 's Armed Forces Department Builds Platform to Improve Quality of Their Full - time Cadres 
Staff Report by Cao Jiawei and Zhu Chunbin : On June 18 , in a class where Jiangsu province Jingjiang City People 's Armed Forces full - time cadres assembled for training , a tutorial course on " Winning the Psychological War under Informationalized Conditions " taught by Lu Yuqing , director of the People 's Armed Forces Department from Xilai town , received unanimous acclaim from participating students . 
This is a new change achieved by the People 's Armed Force Department of this city through giving their full - time cadre actual pressure appropriate to their positions in an effort to improve their overall quality . 
At the beginning of this year , during a grassroots survey , this People 's Armed Forces Department Party Committee discovered that some full - time cadres have worked for a long number of years , held too many posts concurrently and were not putting their main effort into doing People 's Armed Forces work . 
For this reason , they adopted centralized training , held meetings instead of lectures , relied on local party schools to perform training and other methods , and periodically carried out training for full - time cadre in an effort to solve such problems as the full - time cadres ' narrow sphere of knowledge , singular professional capability , etc. 
Based on core work , they boldly assigned duties and increased the pressure on People 's Armed Forces full - time cadres , and through on - the - job training improved their work competence . 
Meanwhile , they actively coordinated with local organization departments and jointly drew up the " People 's Armed Forces Full - time Cadre Achieving Position through Competition Plan . " This clarifies the regulation that the director of the People 's Armed Forces Department must enter the party committee leading group at the same grade and may not concurrently hold any other offices . 
A full - time cadre rotation arrangement system was established to promptly rotate and exchange older full - time cadre unable to adapt to grassroots People 's Armed Forces work , while those comrades with good overall character and strong work capabilities were given promotions and put to use . 
Not long ago , Chen Yisong , the secretary in charge of the People 's Armed Forces Department at New Century Shipyard Ltd . , led a militia technical squad that innovated and developed an underwater vessel welding technology which made up for a deficiency in this nation . He was given an accelerated promotion to director of the company 's People 's Armed Forces Department . 
If You Start Well , You Should Finish Well 
Simply speaking from the match result , a 2 - 2 score is reasonable and is also acceptable to the Chinese team . The key is that the match itself left people feeling somewhat disappointed . 
If Iran was in the lead 2 - 0 and then China came back to even the score , the impression given to Chinese fans would definitely be different and morale would have lifted a lot . What a pity that the situation was exactly the opposite . 
One could say that starting well and being unable to finish well is an old problem for the Chinese team . 
The Chinese team often plays poor soccer when their situation is extremely favorable , and the view of the average person is that the Chinese players are mentally not strong enough . 
Indeed , this is one of the reasons China is incapable of " finishing well . " 
However , looking at China 's match tonight , this does not necessarily seem to be the case . 
Not mentioning Sun Jihai , Sun Xiang , Shao Jiayi , Zhen Zhi and others who played soccer in Europe before , Li Weifeng and others are also old war veterans . They have extensive experience and , logically speaking , should not have any problems pschologically . 
Regretfully , this Chinese team was held to a draw by Iran , and I am afraid that the reason was ineffective deployment of troops in the course of a battle . 
While lagging behind , Iran substituted two people , and the scene immediately improved . 
China also substituted three players in the second half , but the result was not good . 
To overcome the old problem of starting well and being unable to finish well , they must correctly determine the source of the problem . 
As long as the problem can be correctly determined , it should not be hard to find a way to remove the problem . 
What they really should fear is acting blindly out of desperation . 
If they continue this way , no matter how many matches the Chinese team play , they will continue to repeat their old problem . This is a far cry from everyone 's expectation to see them improve with each match they play .

" Small , Scattered , Remote and Direct " Education Coordination Sections at a Second Artillery Base Begin Operations 
Staff Report by Xue Bingjian and Correspondent Xu Yeqing : The phenomenon of difficult organization , few resources , and individual operation in educating the " small , scattered , remote and direct " units will become a thing of the past at a Second Artillery base . 
In recent days , this reporter learned that after half a year of trials , this base issued " Methods of Implementing the ' Ideological and Political Education Syllabus ' " to the grassroots levels . A number of ideological and political education coordination sections covering all the " small , scattered , remote and direct " units at the base were officially set in operation . 
To promote effective implementation of the " Ideological and Political Education Syllabus , " at the beginning of the year , this base used their organizational abilities to conduct an in - depth investigation into the current situation of ideological and political education in " small , scattered , remote and direct " units at the base . They combed through the key problems affecting and restricting education time , staff and effectiveness , and preliminarily formed this kind of new education format of coordination sections for " small , scattered , remote and direct " units . 
The specific modus operandi of the coordination section is to break down unit organization boundaries , specify a brigade or regiment level unit to take the lead in a region with relatively concentrated " small , scattered , remote and direct " units in unified planning of topical education . Units having different subordinate relationships either attend classes nearby together or hold remote discussions by way of a video system . 
A combined method of giving classes in rotation and competing for posts is adopted to unify allocation of educational strength . Educational hardware in parts of a region was used jointly ; and the information , data and educational experiences of all units were shared and exchanged . Typical reporting tours in parts of the region are periodically organized , and officers and soldiers exchange what they have learned . 
Each coordination section has established a full - time education liaison and a part - time educational information collector . 
On this basis , each coordination section has also set up systems to seek help on difficult problems , discuss important educational subject matters , report urgent ideological situations , and to test and appraise . 
Director of the political department at the base , Zhang Shengmin , told reporters that establishing political education coordination sections has not only reduced wastage of educational resources , but has also deepened the effect of the education . 
Some politics instructors were afraid to lose points in front of officers and men from other units , so they took the initiative to learn new knowledge and seek out new methods of education . 
The officers and men receiving education also actively digested the educational content lest they sounded unprofessional in front of officers and men from neighboring units in their discussions and analyses . 
In so doing , the enthusiasm of the educators and the educated has been both effectively stirred up . 
R&R Quota of a North China Sea Fleet Maintenance Battalion Allocated Entirely to Soldiers 
Staff Report by Zhang Junhong and Li Hongjun : On July 17 , under the leadership of Zhang Weiliang , deputy chief engineer of a North China Sea fleet maintenance battalion , the battalion 's 31 soldiers working long - term on the maintenance frontline cheerfully stepped onto the R&R train bound for Beidaihe . 
NCO Class 6 Luo Xiangming happily told the writer : " Battalion leaders caring about and taking care of soldiers have moved us deeply . After returning from R&R , we will definitely work twice as hard ! " 
This is the first time this battalion has organized R&R for grass - roots soldiers . 
Not long ago , when battalion commander Yao Qingsheng went down to the grassroots units , he saw some soldiers in charge of maintenance work carrying out equipment repairs while braving the high temperatures ; it left Yao Qingsheng profoundly moved . 
" Soldiers forget about themselves when working ; the party committee should care about and take care of soldiers and take responsibility for their health . " At the party committee meeting , Yao Qingsheng 's words won everybody 's approval . 
Following research by the party committee , a decision was made to completely allocate the R&R quota assigned to the battalion by their superiors to soldiers working on the maintenance frontline . 
Openly Conducting Work at a Jinan Military Command Department Makes " Hot Issues " Not Hot 
Staff Report 
Report by Wang Weiqin and Special Correspondent Li Deying : On July 25 , at a Service Support Company of Jinan Military Command , the writer saw a public notice board written on with army engineering tenders , financial expenses , cadre promotions , NCOs joining the party , and other important issues prominently hung up in a display window . 
As introduced by political commissar Su Chengsen , this is a concrete action taken by this department to push forward the open office work system . 
At the beginning of this year , this army party committee formulated the " Office and Grassroots Bidirectional Supervision , " " Public Notices of Sensitive Issue , " and other measures to strengthen the building of party conduct and clean government . These require that important issues involving the immediate interests of officers and soldiers and army construction are only decided after listening to the opinion of grassroots officers and soldiers . Also , depending upon the situation , the entire process of office standards , procedures , results , etc. are made public . 
The army set up a suggestion box and notice board , opened up a " message board " on their Intranet and extensively collected everybody 's opinions and suggestions . 
At the beginning of the year , the soldier 's dormitory refurbishment project started . Before work got underway , the party committee extensively solicited opinion from officers and soldiers , and then issued a public tender notice and carried out public tender bidding . 
This both saved expenditures and won the support of officers and soldiers . 
Conducting work openly and fairly has spurred a good atmosphere to take shape at the grassroots level . 
In this army , whether it is settling upon work as large as 'hot issue ' sensitive affairs or as small as taking personal vacation time to visit one 's relatives , the everyday expenditure on mess accounts and other items , the grassroots company persists with scheduled public notices and publications , and take the initiative to accept mass supervision . 
( International ) Research Indicates Atrial Fibrillation Relates to Mutation in Two Types of Gene 
Xinhua News Agency , London , July 2 - Icelandic scientists discovered through research that people with mutation in two types of gene in the body have a far greater risk of getting afflicted with atrial fibrillation than the average person . 
According to a report in the latest issue of Nature magazine , after screening the genes of several thousand people from Iceland , Sweden , the US , and the Hong Kong region of China , researchers at Iceland 's deCODE Genetics Company made the above discovery . 
These two types of gene discovered by scientists are located near that of a type of gene that plays an important role in the early stages of heart development . 
AF , i.e . atrial fibrillation , is clinically one of the most commonly seen cardiac arrhythmias and can give rise to heart palpitations , shortness of breath , tiredness and sudden stroke . 
In addition , according to a report in Nature Genetics magazine published on the 1st , researchers at deCODE Genetics Company also discovered two types of gene on human chromosome 17 correlating to prostate cancer morbidity . They exert some kind of effect in more than one third of prostate cancer cases . 
Research also discovered that while increasing the risk of people getting afflicted with prostate cancer , one of the genes also decreases the risk of getting afflicted with Type II diabetes . 
( Sports ) US Veteran Goalkeeper Keller May Retire after America Cup 
Xinhua News Agency , Maracaibo ( Venezuela ) , July 3 ( Correspondent Liu Jian ) 
According to a Venezuelan media report on the third , US team 's 37 - year - old veteran goalkeeper Keller said in an interview here that if he is unable to find a suitable club to serve after the America Cup , then he will choose retirement . 
" If I am still unable to obtain a one to two season contract in a high level league team four to six weeks after the America Cup ends , then perhaps retirement is not a bad option for me . " 
With Munchen - Gladbach falling to the German Bundesliga 2 , Keller also left this team which he served for more than two seasons . 
Although Keller is considering turning in his gloves , he obviously has more than enough suitors who are interested in him . He spoke candidly that at present , as many as eight teams are interested in inviting him to join them , 
yet this veteran goalkeeping idol , who has served in the Spanish Primera League , the English Premier Division , and German Bundesliga 1 , expressed that how he finally decides , depends upon his family , " My child is already 9 years old , he has stayed with me in three different countries and gone to three different schools . My choice now must consider how to better benefit my family . " 
In the Gold Cup that ended not long ago , Keller performed outstandingly and helped the US team capture the championship . 
In the current America Cup , he was still entrusted with the important task by head coach Bradley , but what can one man do against overwhelming odds ; a US team of " Elite Young Guards " setting out to do battle is fundamentally no rival for such South American giants as Argentina and Paraguay . In these two matches , the goal he guarded was penetrated 7 times . 
The next match , paired up against Columbia , is very likely to be the US team 's and Keller 's final performance in the current America Cup .

Xinhua News Agency , Wuhan , July 11 ( Correspondents Liu Yang and Pi Shuchu ) 
Thirteen pilots submitted their resignation , and " the boss , " China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Limited Liability Company , wrote out a compensation sheet for as high as the massive amount of 105 million . Up until now , this is a labor dispute case which involves Hubei province 's largest compensation amount . 
The Hubei Province Labor Dispute Arbitration Committee is currently examining this case . 
In May this year , 13 pilots at China Eastern Wuhan Company successively submitted their resignation and were refused by the company . 
Subsequently , in the beginning of June , the pilots one by one submitted labor arbitration applications to the Hubei Province Labor Dispute Arbitration Committee , petitioning for an arbitration decision to terminate their working relationship with China Eastern Wuhan Company . 
After China Eastern Wuhan Company received the notice to respond to the lawsuit , they submitted a countersuit demanding the 13 pilots to separately pay them varying consequential damages of over 6 million to over 10 million yuan , in a total of 105 million yuan , for dissolving the employment contract in breach of employment contract stipulations . 
To our understanding , the pilots signed an open - ended employment contract with China Eastern and , unless termination conditions or dissolution conditions stipulated in the employment contract appear , the legal force of the employment contract will continue until the pilot 's legal retirement age . 
The Hubei Province Labor Dispute Arbitration Committee will examine and handle the suit and countersuit in this case together , and hopes to conclude proceedings before August 8 . 
( International ) Germany Calls on Russia to Pass the Latvia - Russia Border Treaty as Soon as Possible 
Xinhua News Agency , Riga , July 12 ( Correspondent Yang Dehong ) The German Foreign Minister Steinmeier , visiting Latvia on the 12th , called on the Russians to pass the Latvia - Russia border treaty as soon as possible . 
That day , Steinmeier and Latvian Foreign Minister Pabriks held a meeting together . Both parties primarily discussed Latvian - German relations , Latvian and EU cooperation , and other issues . They also exchanged opinions and perspectives on the development of Latvian - Russian relations and EU - Russian relations . 
At the press conference held after the meeting , Steinmeier called on the Russians to pass the Latvia - Russia border treaty as soon as possible . 
Steinmeier said that the pace of improvement in relations between Latvia , all the Baltic Sea States , and Russia is relatively slow . Signing of the Latvia - Russia border treaty testifies to the course of development of Latvian - Russian relations , but the " shadow of history " also may possibly cause Latvian - Russian relations to regress again and he hopes the Russian side can pass the Latvia - Russia border treaty as early as possible in order to expedite forward development of relations between the two countries . 
On March 27 this year , after as long as ten years of negotiations , Latvian Prime Minister Kalvitis and Russian Prime Minister Fradkov signed a bi - national border treaty in Moscow . 
On May 17 , the Latvian parliament passed the Latvia - Russia border treaty . 
According to Latvian media reports , the Russian parliament will vote on the treaty in the near future .

Xinhua News Agency , Pyongyang , July 16 ( Correspondents Gao Haorong and Xia Yu ) 
Military representatives from North Korea and South Korea held working - level military contact talks in Panmunjom on the 16th . Both parties agreed to hold their sixth general - level talks from the 24th to the 26th .

When speaking about the maritime boundary issue which is an existing dispute between both parties , Pak Rim Su said for both parties to prevent the occurrence of military conflict in the western sea region , both parties should give up the maritime boundary each has persisted with and mutually acknowledge and respect territorial sea rights , and should take the related agreements between North and South Korea , the North and South Korea Cease - fire Agreement and internationally - recognized law as a basis for negotiation . 
He expressed that the prompt formulation of military safeguard measures to move ahead with North - South cooperative exchange is the " position always maintained " by the North Korean military .

This is the second working - level military contact talks held by the two parties , North and South Korea , since the tenth of this month . 
The Fifth North and South Korea general - level talks were held from May 8 to 11 at the " Unity Pavilion " at Panmunjeom on the North Korean side . 
( International ) Hyundai Motor Denies Intent to Purchase Volvo 
Xinhua News Agency , Seoul , July 18 - A spokesperson for Korea 's Hyundai Motor Company said in Seoul on the 18th that the company has no intention of purchasing Volvo or any brand under the Ford Motor Company label .

( Sports ) Cuba Complains Boxing Ring Ropes Too Short 
Xinhua News Agency , Rio de Janeiro , July 21 ( Correspondents Chen Weihua and Leng Tong ) 
A Cuban delegation complained on the 21st that the boxing ring ropes in the Pan American Games this time are too short and will affect the performance standard of the boxers . 
According to International Boxing Federation rules , during international matches , boxing ring ropes should be 6.1 meters long , but based on measurements by the Cuban delegation boxing team coach , Pedro Roque , the length of boxing ring ropes in the Pan American Games this time is more than one meter shorter than standard . 
Roque said , " We submitted an official protest because this matter does not just affect one country , Cuba , but involves everybody . 
Ropes that are too short will affect the boxers ' dodging movements . " 
He also jokingly said , " If they cannot find ropes complying with Olympic standards in Rio , they can search elsewhere . 
If we had known earlier , we would have brought some from Cuba . " 
That day , Mexican and Columbian delegations also expressed dissatisfaction at the length of the boxing ring ropes . 
Although Columbian boxer Julio Deibis triumphed in his first fight , he said , " Although I won my first match , the boxing ring was too narrow , and it really made me feel uncomfortable . "

A number of overseas distributors also successively requested to place additional orders . 
A few days ago , Mr. Lin Qingrong at Funan Company , Guan Sheng Yuan 's distributor in Singapore , sent a telegram to Guan Sheng Yuan Group expressing that , due to the the result of a sample test by the Agri - Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore on White Rabbit Milk Candy that showed it did not contain formaldehyde , it can be sold as normal on the market . He , therefore , requested to place additional orders . 
Guan Sheng Yuan 's Malaysian distributor , Fengsheng Company , expressed a request for Guan Sheng Yuan to immediately ship one container of White Rabbit Milk Candy to Malaysia from Shanghai . 
Ng Fung Trading Company Limited , Guan Sheng Yuan 's distributor in Hong Kong , also sent a telegram to Guan Sheng Yuan saying that the Hong Kong Center for Food Safety drew samples of White Rabbit Milk Candy in Hong Kong supermarkets and , after performing lab tests , confirmed no formaldehyde component . 
Ng Fung Trading Company Limited has already received a notice from Hong Kong 's Vanguard supermarket of the decision to resume sales of White Rabbit Milk Candy in over 100 of their stores in Hong Kong .

( International ) Suspected Offender Arrested for Making British Supermarket Bomb Threat 
Xinhua News Agency , London , July 26 - British police announced on the 26th that a suspected offender has been arrested in Clitheroe , Lancaster County , on the 23rd for making bomb threats to the British " Tesco " supermarket in the middle of July . 
Police said the person is named Philip McHugh , who is 51 years old and unemployed . He will be charged with carrying out blackmail and making bomb scares . 
On the afternoon of July 14 ( Saturday ) , 14 " Tesco " supermarkets throughout Britain were urgently closed by police due to receiving bomb threats and did not return to business until the next day . 
Saturday just happens to be the peak time for the British people to go shopping at the supermarket . At that time , the closing of 14 supermarkets caused Britain 's largest supermarket chain to lose several million British pounds of sales income . 
British police subsequently carried out a criminal investigation on this bomb threat incident and announced that in this incident they did not discover any sign of terrorist activity , but certain economic motivations are likely to be behind this . 
( Sports ) For Beijing Olympic Games , Flower Season Altered for Flowers to Bloom in " Wrong Season " 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , July 28 ( Correspondent Cui Junqiang ) When next year 's Olympics are held , Beijing in August , with its high temperature and humidity , is expected to transform into a sea of fresh flowers . 
By employing technology to change the flower season , and other measures , scientific researchers have found a good strategy to add color to the Olympic Games . 
At the " Summer Olympics Optimal New Flower Variety Selection and Cultivation Applications Research " project acceptance meeting held on the 28th in Beijing , assessment experts arrived at the conclusion that the use of new technology to spur and control flower cultivation will enable different flower types or varieties with different natural flower seasons to bloom in the same time in the summer , thus the best visual effect will be achieved in August when the Beijing Olympic Games will be held . 
In the Beijing summer , often only a dozen or so types of blooming flowers can be seen . The majority of flowers have either already withered or are still a long time away from their buds opening . 
Through their endeavors , scientific researchers chose 206 types and over 400 varieties of the most optimal flowers for the Summer Olympics . 
At the " 2007 Olympics Flower Exhibition " to be held in Haidian Park , Beijing , around the one year countdown to the Beijing Olympic Games opening , a batch of fresh and bright - colored flowers carefully cultivated by scientific researchers , that in the past have been unable to naturally bloom in August , will welcome visitors . 
( International ) Turkish Ruling Party Wins Parliamentary Election 
Xinhua News Agency , Ankara , July 30 ( Correspondent Wang Jian ) The final results of the 23rd parliamentary election on the 30th announced by Turkey 's Supreme Electoral Commission show that the ruling Justice and Development Party obtained 341 seats of the 550 seat assembly , once again gaining the power to form a single - party cabinet . 
During the parliamentary election held on July 22 , the main opposition party , the Republican People 's Party , obtained 112 assembly seats . 
The National Movement Party obtained 71 assembly seats during the election . 
In addition to the above three political parties , another 26 non - party affiliated people were elected as members of parliament . 
Turkey 's new parliamentary session will hold its first meeting on August 4 . 
In due course , the entire members of parliament will be sworn into office and start to execute their duties . 
After this , the parliament will elect a new parliament speaker by way of a secret ballot . 
The Turkish parliamentary election was originally planned to be held in November but during the presidential elections at the end of April , because the opposition party boycotted the only candidate , deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister G ¨ ¹ l of the Justice and Development Party , it resulted in the failure of the presidential elections , and the parliamentary election was consequentially brought forward . 
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection , I Worry about the Result of Your " Limited Time Combat against Corruption " 
[ Guchanhuo ] posted on 2007-07-12 14:41:10 [ send text messages ] [ table view ] 
The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection gave people guilty of corruption across the country a one - month deadline from May 30 , that is until June 30 , to confess on their own initiative . If they do not do so within the time limit , then they will be arrested . 
I , a common folk , could not help laughing when I learned about this . A month before the police arrest the thief , they told him to confess immediately on his own initiative , or else they will arrest him . Where on earth does such anti - corruption work exist ? ? ? 
Isn 't it the same as explicitly tell the corrupt officials to run quickly and transfer the evidence of crime immediately ? ? ? 
What is the intention ? 
Wouldn 't that ...... Well , I simply cannot say it . 
Then again , even if it really works , what will be the result ? 
Can it check and frighten the corrupt officials ? 
We do not rule out there are timid ones among them who will confess on their own initiative . However , wouldn 't there be more who escape ? 
Not to mention whether or not the result will be remarkable when the deadline of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection arrives , I am afraid that it will produce another effect instead . 
That is , corrupt officials everywhere will all understand tacitly and rejoice secretly . They will all thank the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection . 
There is enough time to quickly transfer the assets in a month . 
If I were a corrupt official , I would definitely think so as well . I would never declare it to you on my initiative either . 
After considering themselves lucky , corrupt officials will also act this way : Haha , thank you ...... 
The people are indeed puzzled . What exactly happened to anti - corruption work ? Why is it so difficult to act vigorously , swiftly , and resolutely ? 
Furthermore , how effective will such anti - corruption work be ? 
In short , Central Commission of Discipline Inspection , I worry about the result of your limited time combat against corruption . 
Non - Privatization of Land Is Bottom Line for My Even Temper 
[ Duchichanshi ] posted on 2007-07-02 10:34:39 [ send text messages ] [ table view ] 
Non - privatization of Land Is Bottom Line for My Even Temper 
I believe I do not get angry easily . At least this is how I feel . 
When speaking at the forum , I have always been rational and even - tempered regardless . I seldom lose my senses and talk nonsense . 
I have also kept my strong faith and ardent expectations in the Party Central Committee all along . No matter how inconsistent the reform measures are with my ideas , I can still accept them and consider them as one of the " special features " . 
However , if privatization of land starts ( or covert privatization ) , then all these will lose the basis on which they exist . 
Rather lose 1,000 soldiers than an inch of land . Only land and resources are the largest social resources . 
Working people and land and resources are the essence of a country . 
As long as the nature of land and resources remains unchanged , then it is very difficult to change the nature of this country . Well , everything basically changes once the nature of land and resources changes . 
I am not a Communist Party member . However , I clearly remember that I made the following pledges : " Cherish my country , love my people deeply , study hard , train well , and be prepared to : devote my strength to the cause of Communism ! " 
" Study diligently , work zealously , first to bear hardship , last to enjoy comfort , and fight for the cause of Communism ! " 
People who once made such pledges and called out " We are successors of Socialism " loudly like I did , if you are still not shameless enough , then you should remember the pledges that you once made . 
If you have already broken your own pledges , please stand up with a quiet conscience and walk away from " Communism " . Don 't embrace this signboard to deceive the masses while ponder how to sell it for a better price at the same time . 
Of course , I wish all these worries were uncalled for . I wish I could keep my senses and composure forever . 
Remember , " We are successors of Socialism . " 
What if there is nothing to take over from ? 
A Generation with Two Eras of Feelings 
A while ago , someone asked if there are any Mao supporters among the 30 - year - olds ? 
It was later changed to 20 years old . 
In fact , people in this age bracket have not experienced the Mao Zedong Era at all . I am not sure whether the brain of the person who raised this question was filled with water or he is born retarded . 
In the cities , people who are best qualified to speak on the Mao Zedong Era should be those who had personally experienced it , those who had suffered agonies of that era . In other words , they should be those who were born between 1950 and 1960 . 
After they were born , their parents joined the movement and did not give their children relative love . 
When they needed nutrition , they were just in time for three years of natural disasters and they suffered from starvation . 
When they started school , once again , they encountered the Cultural Revolution and neglected a few years of studies . 
Some even ended their studies all their lives . They were between 15 and 17 years old . Their studies had not been finished but they were forced to give them up to answer the call of the Party by working in the countryside or mountain areas and supporting the frontier . 
After they started working , they believed that the working class was the most honorable so they voluntarily chose the dirtiest and the most tiring jobs . 
They enjoyed a short period of glory but have been a looser all their lives . 
When they reached the age of marriage , late marriage , late childbearing , and having one child also started from them . 
+ When their salaries should be increased , businesses stress diplomas . Their salaries were not raised because they did not have any diploma . 
They worked hard to raise their children until they were grown . After they finished supporting their children through their basic education and the children were admitted to universities , they again encountered the double jeopardy of educational system reform and state - owned business reform . Tuition fees rose . They were laid off . 
With the increase in age each day , they started to get sick . Unfortunately , they are just in time for the healthcare system reform again . As a result , their illnesses are not treated because they cannot afford the medical expenses . 
As we can see : All social injustices have fallen on this generation of people mercilessly . 
However , not many of these people oppose and attack Mao Zedong . 
Why ? 
They are not slaves of Mao Zedong . They are human beings with flesh and blood and they are a human group living in our society . The history that they personally experienced , from working in the countryside and mountain areas to being laid off , + are squarely the social phenomena of two eras . 
Despite their huge resentment and even hatred of the negligence of studies , the lack of food and clothing , and certain undesirable phenomena in society during the Mao Zedong Era , they still think that the Mao Zedong Era was good judging from national spirit , ethics and morals , as well as social conduct . 
Parents of some net friends are exactly this generation of people . You can chat with them .

" Injected Watermelons " , " Cancerous Bananas " , and " Carton Buns " 
[ Saiwaihuangyuan ] posted on 2007-07-19 22:02:57 [ send text messages ] [ table view ] I remember there was news two years ago about watermelons in Hainan being injected with chemicals with syringes . As a result , it caused a large batch of watermelons in Hainan to rot on the ground and many melon farmers to lose every cent they invested . 
CCTV later conducted a follow - up report and the result confirmed that this matter simply did not exist . 
The report was bizarre from the very beginning because not only was it of no practical significance to inject each watermelon with syringe , it was impossible judging from the workload as well . 
My memory from last year is even clearer . There were media reports stating that the banana trees in Hainan had suffered from a disease similar to human cancer and banana tress that got sick could not avoid dying . 
As a result , many people misunderstood that eating bananas would develop cancer . The consequence was the same . The price of bananas in Hainan plummeted , causing banana farmers inexpressible anxieties and endless complaints . 
The reason the two reports mentioned above both created sensational effects was that they had directly touched the most sensitive nerve of people , which was food safety issue . 
If the media say that certain kind of food will endanger health , then word will definitely spread . People generally adopt the attitude of rather believe it to be true than not toward targets involved . For a person , after all , it is not a matter of life and death to eat a few less watermelons , bananas , and what not from Hainan . However , for the producers and distributors of those products , the impacts are truly serious . 
Not long ago , exciting news on food safely broke out in Beijing again . Simply due to an increase in pork price , someone actually used processed carton as stuffing to make buns . This was precisely the carton buns . 
I was also deeply shocked after hearing this . I felt that the peddlers were so good at exploration that they could actually think of such a method to cheat people . I also widely spread % pw , this news afterwards and warned my family and friends not to buy any bun when they went out . 
However , suddenly , there was news again yesterday stating that the carton bun report was false news . The entire incident was fabricated by one person . Thus , while feeling relieved , I also wondered what happened to the media nowadays . 
The truth I learned from a reliable channel was that a certain Zi , a temporary personnel of the column crew of Transparency of the Beijing Television Life Channel , brought the minced meat stuffing , flour , and carton he bought from the market himself and instructed people including a certain Wei to mix the carton into the minced meat stuffing after soaking it in water and make it into buns . 
A certain Zi used the home DV camera that he brought along to shoot the production process . He edited it afterwards and used deception to have the video broadcast . 
Currently , the public security organ has put a certain Zi in custody according to law and will handle the case seriously in conformity of legal provisions . 
After the case of the bun happened , the government quickly organized relevant departments to launch investigations . It also conducted comprehensive and thorough inspection of the breakfast markets in Beijing to ensure the safety of the dining table of the people . 
After the incident was confirmed , the Beijing Television had publicly apologized to society . It had learned a profound lesson and had strictly dealt with relevant people responsible . It will also further enhance its management to stop the loophole and end false news stories with determination . 
However , even though carton bun was completely unreal , it is still unclear when people will feel at ease to buy buns from stalls again . 
This incident also indirectly reflected the great importance the government attached to food safety and its promptness in action . To a certain extent , it also illustrated that the dining table of Beijing people is relatively safe . The bun incident was a false alarm . It could be considered as a reminder to people as well ! 
To Whom Should Education Be Accountable ? 
I recently heard a friend in China talked about a story of a school . It provoked my reflections and I could not refrain from expressing them . 
The incident happened at a private middle school in Shanghai City - Southwest Weiyu Middle School . 
The school decided to assign the best teachers to the three classes that signed a contract to directly promote from its own junior to senior high school . Meanwhile , it let a few young teachers who had no high school senior class teaching experience with poor teaching results in the past to lead the other few classes that were admitted to the school from outside schools or those who were promoted without a contract . 
Its reason was : Students who signed a contract at that time agreed to abstain from applying for other senior high schools . Therefore , based on the agreement , the school had to assure that it would provide them with the best teachers . 
While for students of the other few classes , the position of the school was : Young teachers should be given training opportunities . 
I could not help but to sigh . After all , to whom is education accountable ? 
I remember many years ago when I attended a key senior high school , because of the dissatisfaction with the teaching standard of a Math teacher , the entire class signed a collective request to ask the school to change the teacher without understanding the difficulty of things . 
The school actually changed the teacher for us in the end because the commitment of the school to us was to treat every student fairly and to be accountable to every student . 
I came to the United States to attend graduate school 10 years ago . 
When I was selecting courses for the next semester one summer , I found that the elective courses planned by the department were all theoretical - based courses while application - based courses were not scheduled at all . 
I went to talk to the Chair of the Department and told him that I believed there was a problem with the curriculum . 
The Chairman of the Department acknowledged that due to a shortage in teachers , application - based course was not offered . However , it would be offered in a year or two once teachers were available . 
I remember I told him then , " This is your problem , not mine . 
I came afar from Shanghai to attend your school precisely because I was attracted by your course description . 
If you are incapable of offering these courses , then do not put them in your description . Otherwise , it is false advertisement . You are being irresponsible to me and my family . " 
After hearing what I said , the Chair of the Department thought for a moment , then said , " Well , I will see what I can do to resolve this . 
It may be too late because all courses have been scheduled for online registration . " 
The Chairman of the Department talked to me three weeks later . The gist was to tell me that his job was to be accountable to every student including me . 
After listening to my opinion , he tried his best to add two application - based elective courses . He hoped that I could understand . 
I took a few courses taught by the Chairman of the Department after this incident . 
He never held any prejudice against me just because I had lodged a complaint to him . He gave me an A fairly in each course . 
On the eve of graduation , I heard his secretary mentioned that he tried his best for every student but not every student was grateful to him . 
At the graduation ceremony , as the representative of the Honors students , I told the Chairman of the Department in my speech that we all thanked him for all he had done for us from our hearts because he had tried his best to be accountable to every one of us . 
I believed that I had made the right choice in life to choose to study there . 
When I said this , I could faintly see that the Chairman of the Department had tears in his eyes ... If one day , all educators in China and the entire educational system can both be accountable to every student , then I believe the day that China actually makes rapid progress will be in sight . 
Central NY Men 's 4s Volleyball Tournament 
I took part in the Central NY Men 's 4s Volleyball Tournament last Sunday . After playing for six and a half hours , our team finally won the championship . 
The tournament was in fact a scrimmage organized to prepare us for entering the volleyball competition in the Empire State Summer Games . 
The coach broke up the four men 's competing teams in Central New York region ( high school team , college team , 35 - and - up team , and 45 - and - up team ) and regrouped us into four people a team with a setter in each team to compete . 
The rules of the tournament were very interesting . Only the back row could attack . Fake hit to inside the 3 - meter line was prohibited . The setter alone could block with no position substitution . 
Therefore , it was basically a test of powerful offense capabilities as well as decision making and jockey for position in defense . 
Our team had : a 2 - meter tall opposite hitter whose offense was a strong point as well as from a high point . He was responsible for over 60 percent of the offense and the scores of the entire match ; a 1.85 - meter tall setter who blocked many balls dead by himself ; 
a 1.90 - meter tall middle hitter who missed quite a bit of his offense since he was at the back row ; 
and me , a 1.75 - meter tall outside hitter who launched surprise offense from time to time . My success rate was not bad . I was mainly responsible for receiving the opponent 's crosscourt smash . 
There were seven teams in total . First , we had the round robin . After our team won the first game , the ref repeatedly ruled that our opposite hitter fouled for stepping on the line during offense . This largely affected our team 's morale . We were smashed and lost three games in a roll . 
However , we calmed down after our losses . Our coordination had also stabilized during these three games . As a result , we began our winning streak . 
The round robin ended . Our team had three wins and three losses . We were in the sixth place based on the ratio between the total points we scored and the total points we lost . 
The supplementary matches followed . Apart from the top - seeded team , teams from the second to the seventh place played elimination games in pairs . 
The mentality and strategies of our team were stable . We played strong and led all the way to enter the semi - finals . 
In the semi - finals , our opponents had strong offense but weak defense . My shoulders were bruised from the hitting . However , once I dug a spike , I was twice as happy as when I successfully spiked a ball myself . 
I did not even know what the final score was . We just won . 
In the finals , our opponent had balanced offense and defense . Our serves foiled their offense quite a bit and we led all the way . 
When it was 21:24 in the end , our team had the match point . I received two successive serves from the other team but hit the ball out of bounce at both times . It was 23:24 . Our team 's opposite hitter ran toward me and said , " No problem . It was only two balls . " 
The next ball flew toward me again . Fortunately , I received it well . The setter did a backward pass to the opposite hitter and ended the battle with a spike . 
Discussion on Issues of Morality Again 
Much has been said about morality for scattered and free individuals . 
I have nothing more to say in this aspect . 
What I want to talk about now is group - related . 
We always encounter occasions that require collective . 
In these occasions , certain morality is required for a group . 
We can often find certain good morality among groups that have succeeded . 
This is not by chance . 
It is because for these businesses or activities to overcome certain immediate difficulties , to unite and put aside religious - based factors , I believe good morality also play a role that cannot be overlooked . 
At the least , it can be predicted with great confidence that a group of people with low moral standard can hardly accomplish any successful great deeds together . 
Perhaps it is because wisdom to see long - term benefits with rational long - range perspective is a necessary quality for a group to succeed . 
In fact , groups always employ various means to acquire identity such as logo , jargon , religion , so on , and also morality . 
Only Brandy day and night can orchids be seen everywhere along the path of life . 
[ Discussion ] Throughout Your Life , How Many Times Have You Been Truly Happy ? 
My good friend from senior high school finally got her visa and can set off to attend graduate school at a famous university in the west coast of the United States at the end of August . 
A few of our classmates had a little get - together today . We were really happy for her that her wish could finally come true . 
I truly envied her when I saw how happy she was . 
I thought , throughout my life , the only time I was that happy was when I was admitted to senior high school . At that time , I had never imagined that I would be admitted to a famous school that was one of the best in the city . Afterwards , I attended university and work as a matter of course . I had never been so happy again during that time . 
I was admitted to a university but it was not the one that I had longed for before , so I was by no means very happy . 
My only hope during university was to be able to go to the north after graduation to join my boyfriend , whom I had been in love with for two years . 
However , the Creator played trick on me . One month before I graduated , he suggested to part . All the illusions that I had before went up in smoke . 
After that , I simply returned to the north to work . Now , I have been working for almost two years and have made enough money to buy a midrange car . However , I have never been that happy again . 
I had a deep understanding of my good friend 's happiness when I chatted with her today . She had been preparing this gingerly and with efforts for a year . Finally , she can go abroad to begin a new life without much trouble . The feeling of having one 's dream fulfilled really makes one very happy . 
I have no plan to further my study , nor do I like living abroad either because I had worked abroad for half a year before and found that the life abroad did not suit me . 
When I saw my good friend 's happiness , I could not help but to ponder , " What about my pursuit ? " 
" How can I make myself so happy again ? " 
Perhaps it is to find someone who truly likes me and is willing to spend the rest of his life with me . 
I think I will be moved to tears at that time , just like my good friend told me that when she passed the interview at the embassy and got the approval notice , she could not refrain herself from crying . The yearlong efforts and worries were finally paid off . 
Then , what about me ? 
Time and again , I act with caution and give attention to my relationship . When can my wish also come true so I can cry with joy ? 
Perhaps I am not promising . I never worry about my own career , but about relationship ... 
When will my relationship find its destination ? 
I remain very sad in this matter . 
Fellow brothers and sisters , how about you ? 
Throughout your life , how many times have you been truly happy ? 
Let 's Promote School of Architecture Southeast University 
Haha , consider this an introduction of the School of Architecture for the alumni of the Southeast University . 
This is the latest first hand information with personal experience . It is guaranteed authentic . 
Dean Wang , Secretary An , Mr. Li from the Personnel Department , and a few other teachers from the Research Institute of Architecture participated in the report . I talked for an hour and then other people talked for approximately an hour and a half . 
When the formal report ended , Mr. Zhang ( Assistant Dean ) pulled me aside and asked me to go talk in the back office behind closed doors . 
He was very amicable . He closed the door and told me that it was inconvenient to say certain things at the formal meeting . He said that he could tell that I felt uncertain about future income so he told me some specific income situations of teachers at the School of Architecture to ease my mind . 
Dean Wang gave a brief account of the School of Architecture before the report . He said that there are only six major architectural disciplines across the country . The Southeast University has two , the Qinghua University has two , the Tongji University has one , the Tianjin University has one , and there is none other than that . 
He said that the State has put special emphasis on energy conservation in building , environmental - friendly construction , and the science of architectural technology in the past few years . The Southeast University wants to recruit a teacher in this area . 
He said that they had received over 20 resumes from inside the country , Japan , and the United States ( I seemed to be the only one ) applying for that stream . 
The School of Architecture took this seriously . It also conducted careful examination of the job applicants . 
The Southeast University is indeed relatively ahead when compared to other schools of architecture at some colleges and universities that I know of . The Urban Planning at the Tongji University should be one better than the Southeast University . However , it seems that the Southeast University is a little better in the stream of architectural design ( I did not expect this before ) . 
Dean Wang said that in the past two years , the scientific research funding of the School of Architecture has been abundant . It is a key development university under the State 's 985 Program . 
He told me that last year , the higher - up allocated a lump - sum of 10 million yuan development funds to the School of Architecture Southeast University , of which 3.5 million yuan was directly spent on purchasing books to substantiate the professional library of the School of Architecture ( haha , I also have to praise this . How generous with spending ! ) 
Almost all of what remained was spent on the purchase of experiment equipments of my specialty . 
Allegedly , it made a few academicians quite dissatisfied . 
Haha ¡ « ¡ « ¡ « Let 's say a few words in passing . I think that they were overcharged for some imported equipment . 
There is an experiment system used for measuring air tightness of a room that is very popular in the United States . I guess it definitely cost less than US $ 500 . As it turned out , the Southeast University had paid Renminbi 50,000 yuan for it ! ! ! 
Other situations included that many schools and faculties at the Southeast University had moved to the new campus in Jiulonghu . However , the School of Architecture insisted on staying , claiming that it has to provide students with a good architectural atmosphere because the old campus still has some classic structures to look at while there is none in the new campus . 
Haha ¡ « ¡ « ¡ « since all other faculties had moved away , the School of Architecture seemed to have acquired another building . 
Therefore , Dean Wang told me clearly from the very beginning that he can allocate an exclusive office for me in the future . 
I felt very sorry that I simply was not aware of anything when Dean Wang mentioned this . 
Later , Mr. Zhang pulled me aside and told me that it is not an easy thing to do because there is a huge shortage in office and even some old professors do not have their separate offices . 
This made me feel very uneasy . It seemed that I still knew little about the situation of the country . 
In brief , I had a great time during the visit to the Southeast University . Leaders and relevant teachers of the School of Architecture Southeast University demonstrated that they were very dedicated and enthusiastic . They had left an excellent impression on me . 
May the Southeast University develops smoothly and the School of Architecture continues to stay ahead ! 
Qinhuai River in the Oaring Sound and Light Shadow 
The Best of Friends Must Part 
I had lunch with colleagues two weeks ago to bid farewell to our former boss . 
This boss can be considered a pearl among women . She was very nice to us subordinates . We were also most willing to work for her and even worked overtime at night and during weekend , which is rarely seen among Americans . She was also the best boss that I had ever worked for . 
She left the company and now offers Math tutorial classes that cater to elementary and middle school students because she needs to take care of the family and have more time to raise her children . 
I believe she will succeed in whatever she does ! 
Sun Yanzi Delivers Love to Africa , Experiences Sandstorm , Stoning , Scratch ( picture series ) 
Taking care of sick children . 
Showing " bicep " . 
Sun Yanzi accompanied the World Vision to Niger , Africa twice after her Congo trip . 
At yesterday 's press conference , she frankly admitted that it was the most tiring trip ever . 
The local weather was hot and the drinking water was muddy . She was also stoned by angry protesting masses while visiting the market , and even riding on a camel , she was scratched . 
The entire journey was filled with predicaments , which made her cried out in secret several times , " I want to go home so much ! " 
Shocked to See Malnourished Children 
Sun Yanzi had participated in the World Vision 's caring for poor children activities for three consecutive years . She called herself an experienced spokesperson . 
She brought 30 bottles of vitamin , 40 torches , and 500 candies to share with local children . 
She stated that repeated experiences accumulated showed that no matter how many small gifts she brings , it will never be enough . 
The most serious problem in Niger is that mothers do not understand the issue of childrearing at all and children suffer from severe malnutrition . 
On her eight - hour road trip from the capital of Niger to the small town of Tahoua located 500 miles away , Sun Yanzi experienced a sandstorm that was rarely seen in the area . 
With wind blown dust and rain , the entire sky was stormy . 
The jeep she was riding on also swayed in the wind . 
When Sun Yanzi thought about that moment , she revealed with lingering fear that even though she was inside the car , she was terrified . 
She later heard the locals explained that sandstorm is a symbol of good luck . It brings rain to moisten the land . Only after that did she relaxed a little . 
With local residents . 
Pained by Mothers ' Childrearing Problem 
When she arrived at Tahoua , local officials held a one - humped camel welcoming ceremony and invited Sun Yanzi to sit on the camel to receive the cheers of the locals . 
However , the camel was scared by the flashlights and was completely out of control . It nearly threw Sun Yanzi onto the ground . 
In the end , Sun Yanzi jumped down by herself but her clothes were accidentally torn by the seat cushion . She cut her back and left an 8 - cm long small bloody scar . 
During this trip , Sun Yanzi visited four local sick children who were severely malnourished . Among them was a four - month old baby who only weighted 2.1 kilos and did not look like a human being at all . 
She said , " I was very sad when I saw him . His situation was indeed very serious but it should also be the problem of the mothers . They should be taught correct nutritional concepts . " 
Key to Chinese Education - Humanization 
Key word : Key to Chinese Education - Humanization Key to Chinese Education - Humanization 
The objective of education is : to enable people being educated to survive and enjoy more easily in existing social environment . 
" Survive " is easy for people to understand . Yet , people may simply perceive " enjoy " as " having fun " . In fact , this is not the case . The " enjoy " here covers a wide scope . 
Survive - includes strengthening of physical strength and growth in intelligence 
1 . Strengthening of physical strength - - to strengthen + bodily strength and enhance coordination through various [ sporting activities ] so that athletic ability will continue to rise and be able to meet the demand of bodily performance and the need to socialize with society . 
2 . Growth in intelligence - - to be able to recognize more clearly the society where one lives , to know oneself , to learn to make contact with other people , and to learn the skills to adapt to survival and to experience enjoyment . 
The objective of education was mentioned above . It does not have a strong connection with this article . Now , let 's talk about the focal point : key to Chinese education - humanization . 
The essence of human characteristic is : to fully understand the difference between individuals and not to treat them as the same . 
Club Original : A Few Common Phases in Learning Buffett 
Club Original : A Few Common Phases in Learning Buffett : I Am Strolling 
1 ) First phase : When one first learns about Buffett , one will feel as if one has found a rare treasure and will immediately put it into practice . However , the shallow and incomplete understanding of Buffett 's conceptions always makes one misuse them , use them indiscriminately , and use them blindly . Therefore , results are intermittent . 
2 ) Second phase : A " breakthrough " in Buffett . After a period of study and practice , almost every " wise man " will consider a few questions : for instance , How should Buffett with Chinese characteristics be ? 
Should Buffett 's theories be applied flexibly in China ? 
Can we do it better than Buffett does ? 
Therefore , this phase is mainly characterized by self - righteousness , blind arrogance , and the pursuit of Buffett 's theories with Chinese characteristics . 
After a period of practice , the results are still always intermittent and non - sustainable . If one is fortunate , it is best to suffer some losses and mend one 's way as soon as possible . 
3 ) Third phase : Return to Buffett . After a few commotions , one can finally understand that one is an ordinary person and not a genius . 
One should have lower expectations of oneself . It is entirely enough to just learn Buffett conscientiously . 
The simplest is the most effective instead . Nevertheless , simple methods always embody profound principles . One must understand these principles before one can better implement simplicity to the fullest . 
The manifestation of this phase is having little short - term results but many long - term ones with sustainability . 
4 ) Fourth phase : " Diehard " Buffett . After experiencing sustainable results , one is basically incorrigibly obstinate about Buffett 's theories in this phase . His attitude toward non - Buffett 's companies is one of total disdain . 
Continue to study and deepen the understanding of Buffett as well as put the knowledge into practice . The manifestation of this phase is continuously improved results with sustainability and the progression to a virtuous cycle . 
The time each person needs in each phase varies . Both individual situation and luck have a bearing on it . 
Devote Wholeheartedly to Buddha ( 236553903 ) 14:18:05 
He is my old net friend . He sent such a story among the group . 
I would rather write this story in this column . 
I hope that everyone can see this article . I do not expect it to become so - called " cream " . However , some matters and some principles can often be learned from a short but effective story instead . 
This is a story that chills people 's heart after reading it . 
I truly hope that this is indeed just a story ...... because I feel really sad ...... 
On the mountainous road , three gunmen actually had their eyes set on the beautiful female driver . They forced the mini - bus to stop and wanted to take the female driver off the mini - bus to have fun . The female driver called for help in desperation . All the passengers on the mini - bus kept silent out of fear . 
Only a weak middle - aged man exerted himself at the call but he was hit and lying on the ground injured . 
The man was extremely angry . He rose with all his strength and shouted at the entire bus of people to ask them to stop the violence . However , no one responded . They all allowed the female driver to be dragged to the thick growth of grass in the mountain . 
An hour later , the three scoundrels and the female driver with her clothes half - buttoned returned . 
The mini - bus was about to run again . The female driver asked the weak man who was bleeding from injury to get off the mini - bus . 
The man refused . He insisted without yielding . 
Hey , you get off the bus . My bus does not take you ! 
The middle - aged man became angry and said , " How could you be so unreasonable ? Am I wrong to try to save you ? " 
" You saved me ? " 
" What did you save me from ? " 
The female driver flatly denied , causing a few passengers to snicker . 
The middle - aged man was extremely angry and wished that he would have the strength of a chivalrous swordsman ! 
Even if he failed to save her , he still should not have to bear the consequence of being expelled from the mini - bus . He insisted on not getting off . 
" Moreover , I already bought a ticket . I have the right to ride on the bus ! " 
The driver looked up and said mercilessly , " If you don 't get off , then I will not drive . " 
To one 's surprise , the bus - full of passengers who just turned a blind eye to the violence earlier seemed to have awaken % pw , instead and made concerted effort in persuading the man to get off the mini - bus , " Please get off quickly . We still have things to do . We can 't afford the delay ! " 
A few passengers with strong physical strength even wanted to approach the middle - aged men and drag him off the mini - bus . It reminded people of the scene in Boule de Suif by Maupassant . 
The three scoundrels smiled from ear to ear . They gloated with pride and smiled . 
A dauntless scoundrel among them said shamelessly , " We guys made her become unrestrained by playing with her ! " 
The other two scoundrels also talked nonsense , " She is my girlfriend . It 's none of your business ! " 
An argument ended when the luggage of the man was thrown out from the mini - bus window and he was pushed and shoved off the mini - bus afterwards . 
The mini - bus moved steadily on the mountainous road again . The female driver brushed aside her hair once and turned the recorder on . 
The mini - bus almost reached the mountaintop . It would go downhill after a turn . On the left of the mini - bus was a road built from blasting off the mountaintop , on its right was a bottomless cliff . 
The mini - bus quietly accelerated . The face of the female driver was very calm . Her two hands held the steering wheel tightly . Sparkling tears trickled from her eyes . 
A scoundrel seemed to have noticed something and said , " Slow down . Slow down . Goddamn , what do you want to do ? " 
The female driver did not speak . The mini - bus was gaining speed . 
The scoundrel attempted to throw himself at the steering wheel and seize it , but the mini - bus was charging toward the cliff like an arrow let fly ...... 
The next day , local newspaper reported : " Tragedy Happens in Fuhu Mountainous District Yesterday , Mini - bus Falls off Cliff " . 
The driver and the 13 passengers on board did not survive the accident . 
The middle - aged man who was expelled from the mini - bus halfway cried when he saw the newspaper . 
No one knew what he cried about and why . 
Evils of Railway Stations 
I recently traveled on train for a few days and found out the evils of railway stations in various places during summer passenger transport period ! 
I want to know what I need to pay attention to at railway stations in various places . 
I am from Changsha . Let 's talk about the situation in Changsha first . Everyone needs to pay attention when you go to the Changsha Railway Station . 
1 . The forever hard to buy railway tickets : It is absolutely impossible to buy a ticket at Changsha Railway Station at major holidays or when school ends and starts during winter and summer holidays . It is still of no avail no matter how early one waits in line . 
The most flawless answer I got was that the travel agencies had booked all the tickets ! 
However , if one puts in extra money , one can get as many as one wants from the scalpers . 
2 . Beware of counterfeit tickets : Tickets in the hands of scalpers are not necessarily real . In Shuangfeng and Xinhua , Hunan , a person relied on fake identity cards to get rich while another relied on counterfeit silver coins and counterfeit coins to make a fortune . Thus , counterfeit ticket is indeed child 's play ! 
Patching up is the most rudimentary form . Some counterfeit tickets are so real that even train attendants cannot differentiate them ! 
3 . Who moved my bills : Be extremely careful when buying things from stores inside the railway station ! 
If you want to give small bills , oh , oh , your bills always miss the corner so you have to substitute them with a large bill . 
However , after you substitute them with a large bill , the storeowner will say that he has no change for sure and return the bill to you . Then , he will take the small bills with the missing corner . At this time , you will be forced to take a counterfeit large bill back . 
4 . Magicians give change : Not all the storeowners will switch your large bills . That is a crime and the risk is higher ! 
Therefore , some " timid " storeowners have to be magicians . You clearly see that the change that he counted is right but when you have a chance to count it yourself , oh , oh , a few bills are missing . 
5 . Foreign wine everywhere : There are not too many teahouses at the railway station . However , you will find out once you enter . 
A few glasses of low - grade red wine can be sold at Martini 's price . If you do not pay , then your mother may not be able to recognize you either . 
6 . Roses and guns : There are many video parlors around the railway station . The titles of the programs shown are very attractive to vulgar men like us regardless . Thus , if you go in to watch , you will definitely be considered as distinguished guest who wants to relax a bit . As a result , a rose MM will immediately come over to accompany you . Of course , you will have to be able to afford the money of five - star hotel consumption . No , broadswords do not always chop at foreigners ! 
Ice and fire : If you have a Changsha accent or if you are very familiar with Changsha , then never expect to be able to hail a cab at the front terrace of the railway station . The facial expression of the taxi driver can let you know what injustice is ! 
However , if this is the first time you visit Changsha , congratulations . Even if you are going to a place that is only within five - minute walk , the driver will still take you to admire sceneries of a state - level key tourist city with enthusiasm . He will also let you inhale the famous Baisha brand secondhand cigarette and smell the highly regional areca . 
Of course , you need to pay for your own fare , don 't you ? 
Nanjing Subway Driver Should Receive Immediate Psychological Conditioning 
Key word : psychological conditioning 
According to report of Xinhua News Agency , an incident involving a death by laying on the track happened inside the Nanjing subway on the night of July 3 . 
Based on description of the reporter , " Zhu Zhengting , 22 , is a young subway driver who had experienced a nightmarish scene . When the reporter saw him yesterday , it seemed that he still had not recovered from the shock . He sat straight on the chair and had a far - away look in his eyes . " 
Apparently , the young driver had suffered immense psychological shock and is in need of urgent psychological conditioning . Otherwise , it will leave trouble to the rest of his life . 
I am not sure if people remember the rescuer in Texas , United States who rescued a girl from an abandoned oil well more than 10 years ago . After experiencing prolonged mental distress , he eventually chose suicide to end his painful life . 
At that time , even though he had undergone simple psychological conditioning , people paid more attention to the girl who was rescued and simply neglected the person who needed psychological conditioning more . The tragedy could not be prevented eventually . 
Similarly , in the Dover Strait illegal immigrant incident a few years ago , the British police officer who first opened the container allegedly was scared senseless at the scene . 
British authorities later put him through psychological conditioning for more than two months before they returned him to normal . 
People suffer from immense psychological damage after experiencing disastrous stimulus . During this time , it is very difficult to completely recover by relying on personal strength alone . Psychological scar will always be left behind . 
Since outsiders can hardly notice this type of scar , and even if it is discovered , they still cannot do anything either . Many people involved will feel painful for their entire life as a result . 
However , in our country , people do not show enough concern for psychological damage . Especially families or administrative departments of the people involved , more often than not , they will abruptly think of it only after the best recovery period has passed , but it is already too late then . 
Nowadays , with the diversification of the media , we learn about some appalling incidents all the time . Many female youth were harmed and many young children witnessed their parents suffered from cruel injuries . 
After these youth were rescued , we seldom heard that they had received psychological treatment . More of them were offered familiar comfort by relatives . 
Even though the victims can feel that they are already safe , the damage they experienced has become an incurable scar that will always be awaken and affects the life of the people involved . 
Fortunately , the leader of the driver offered him consolation immediately , which could relieve his psychological pressure . 
After all , the driver was not responsible for the accident . In addition , the driver had also adopted measures when he found out the situation . He had done what he should do ; only that he did not stop the tragedy from happening . 
I believe that even if it were not the driver involved , anyone present would be shocked by the accident that happened at the scene . 
Nonetheless , other people are not connected to the person who committed suicide in regards to responsibility . Despite being shocked , it will gradually fade from their memories with the passing of time . 
The driver involved is not as fortunate . He must remember and probably will remember it for a lifetime . 
We can consider him fortunate if he can liberate himself from this . If he cannot free himself from it , he will always be tortured by such shock . 
Modern health concepts are much more comprehensive than those in the past . People began to show concern for mental health . 
Regrettably , the mental state of human beings is very depressing . Particularly in the cities , the mental health of people is very unsatisfactory . Majority of people suffer more or less from hidden psychological dangers . Yet , some people still have not raised enough concern when they encounter problems . 
Think about the lesson learned from the " Yang Lijuan incident " that happened a while ago . Some irresponsible media outlets used a patient tormented by mental problems as target of media hype , thus causing serious social impacts . 
We should avoid this type of incident from happening in the future . Otherwise , our society will truly become a diseased society . 
Five Teachers at Dongkou No. 5 Secondary School Experience Myriad of Feelings after First Session of New Curriculum Training 
Key words : Dongkou No. 5 Secondary School , teachers , first session , [ new curriculum training ] Five Teachers at Dongkou No. 5 Secondary School Experience Myriad of Feelings after First Session of New Curriculum Training The first group of teachers at the Dongkou No. 5 Secondary School who participated in the new curriculum training had vividly experienced the pressure and incentive of the new curriculum from the morning of July 13 to July 15 . 
At the same time , they also believed that the new curriculum reform is an opportunity and challenge to the educational development of the school that is hard to come by . 
On the morning of the 13th , due to traffic jam resulted from road construction of the highway section between Shijiang and Longhui in Dongkou , it was past 1 p.m. when the few teachers at the Dongkou No. 5 Secondary School and teachers from areas including Suining rushed to the Municipal Education Bureau . Staff of the education bureau , whose time to get off work had long pasted , % pw moved the training materials that were already moved onto the car back down to finish the relevant procedures for us . We also received the training materials . 
At 2:30 p.m. , the travel - worn and weary teachers braved the sweltering summer heat again to enter the multimedia classrooms at the city 's No. 1 Secondary School , No. 2 Secondary School , and No. 6 Secondary School to listen to the lectures of relevant experts . 
In the two days that followed , the teachers either listened to lectures of authors and editors of the curriculum or experiences of teachers from provinces that had already entered the new curriculum reform . Some teaching researchers and teachers who had participated in the provincial new curriculum training also gave an account of their understanding and experiences . 
On the morning of the 15th , after attending all training courses and taking the examination , the five teachers at the Dongkou No. 5 Secondary School , having studied hard and never arrived late and left early , successfully passed the examination and received the graduation diploma . 
During the training , the teachers at the Dongkou No. 5 Secondary School held exchanges among each other . In the beginning , they all felt that the new curriculum was quite unfamiliar , the responsibility was huge , the pressure heavy , and it was hard to grasp . 
However , after the training , they all believed that it is also an opportunity and a challenge . 
They all determined to work hard to adjust their knowledge structure and try their best to successfully accomplish the mission of reforming the curriculum . 
The second group of teachers who participated in the new curriculum training had arrived at relevant locations on the 16th to receive their training . 
Dongkou No. 5 Secondary School Holds New Curriculum Training Meeting to Plan Matters in Attending Curriculum Reform Training at Municipal Education Bureau 
Key words : Dongkou No. 5 Secondary School holds new curriculum training meeting , [ plan ] 
Dongkou No. 5 Secondary School Holds New Curriculum Training Meeting to Plan Matters in Attending Curriculum Reform Training at Municipal Education Bureau At noon on July 5 , the school held a teacher meeting on the attending of the summer new curriculum training in the principal 's office . 
Principal Xie conveyed the spirit of the new curriculum training conference that he attended in the county . He enunciated the significance of the new curriculum reform . In addition , he made specific arrangements for the personnel , the time , the fee , and the matters for attention in regards to the attending of the training . 
According to briefing , people who attended the Shaoyang City new curriculum reform training conference were principals , deans , and teachers % pw who will teach the first year of senior high school next term .

Classes for History are to be held at Shaoyang No. 1 Secondary School . 
Upon returning , the school will also reimburse 60 yuan for tuition and fare . Allowances for business trip and so on cannot be claimed . 
Glad to Befriend Stars ' Fans 
Key word : stars ' fans 
I have a female friend whom I have never met before . 
I told her directly , " I admire you very much ! 
It is because you express your love openly . " 
She likes the male anchor of a popular entertainment show in Taiwan and never conceals this type of feeling . 
When the male anchor hosted a show in Jinan , she flew to Jinan . When he made a guest appearance in Changsha , she flew to Changsha . 
In the book that the male anchor wrote , he said that a friend presented him with a slingshot with no bullet . She told me with a pleasant surprise , " I presented him with that slingshot . " 
She also participates in creating an electronic magazine for this star . She reads every issue with me with excitement . 
I have always quite enjoyed befriending people who are open about being fans of so - and - so stars themselves . 
These stars can be movie and television stars . They can be star players . Of course , they can also be great men . 
I never consider these friends shallow . I think they are very likable . 
These people are people with true temperament in general . Their likes and dislikes are real . 
It is very relaxing to mix with this type of people . 
Even though they will not consider your feelings 100 percent , at least you know all their emotions . You also know that you will have bigger sense of security when fraternizing with them . 
These people are also very honest . 
One should realize that it requires courage to express one 's likes . 
Precisely due to this reason , many people will like a person but not letting it known for their entire life . In addition , they may even quite despise people who brazenly claim to be fans of so - and - so . 
I believe honesty is the biggest strength of a person . Be honest with one 's friends and oneself . 
However , it is indeed very difficult to achieve . 
It also proves that one has selflessness in one 's heart if one is able to like a star . 
My friends are all fans of some stars . 
Sometimes , in order to get a glimpse of the stars , they can endure hardships , sacrifice a lot , live frugally , hold cardboard with their left hand and press the camera with their right with their mouth yelling at the same time . 
We can say that they are very simpleminded and na ? ve . However , it requires selflessness to love a person without giving any thought to reciprocation . 
It is because in reality , there is too much self - admiration and self - righteousness for oneself and disapproval of others . Therefore , this selflessness seems somewhat precious . 
Thus , if all of us are chatting and we say that the stars we like are so - and - so , if one of us says , " I never adore other people " , 
haha , then we have to be careful . 
Zhang Xiaohui That Person 
Key word : Zhang Xiaohui 
I saw an episode of Kangxi Arrives that I had not seen for ages by chance . The lead was Zhang Xiaohui . 
I remember it was the time when she was advertising for Color Blossoms . 
The time I watched Color Blossoms was the days when I was obsessed with erotic movies . 
At that time , I felt very odd because pornographic movies could actually be shot so aesthetically . Sometimes they were also very interesting by being called erotic movies . 
In fact , I have not watched too many erotic movies but they have covered many countries . 
The ones I first came into contact were from Korea and Japan . 
I later watched quite a bit from third world countries , Latin America , and Europe but less from Hollywood and France instead . 
I was unwilling to delete two of them from my computer . One was Youth and the other was Color Blossoms . 
The first half of Color Blossoms was still quite good . Everyone was rookie and all put forth efforts in their performances . The director also had high standard . 
However , the latter half was somewhat perverted . I could not take it at all . 
Actually , what I want to say is that in the program , Zhang Xiaohui said that her boyfriends almost cover every country in the world except Africa . 
She currently has four boyfriends . 
I am afraid people in general cannot accept this matter . They will say that this person is promiscuous . 
However , the crux of the matter is that she was very honest and showed no expression that made people uncomfortable when she talked about these issues . 
She also discussed her own view of love . 
For instance , the two parties should be financially independent . 
I assume it also requires independent personality and being able to control one 's own destiny . 
It is because I know that love is alive and selfish for people who are in love . How would someone allow the person he loves to accept other people 's love at the same time ? 
Based on my experience and conjecture , most probably , the love of Zhang Xiaohui is no longer tender and romantic . She must be the typical sister - brother - love . 
In sister - brother - love , the older sister can tolerate everything including having several little brothers at the same time . Meanwhile , the little brother can bear boundless attachment to the older sister because of the other party 's charm and maternal instinct . However , he may not mind whether he is the only one , so on and so forth . 
Nevertheless , from the conversation of Zhang Xiaohui , I also found that she is indeed someone who knows how to enjoy life very well . 
For example , she loves traveling to the extent of excessively extravagant . 
Thus , I also have reason to believe that her life is also very wonderful . 
If it were before , I am afraid I still could not accept this phenomenon . 
It is just like I have also accepted many people now . In fact , it has little to do with being tolerant or not . It depends on once I straighten it out ; there is no absolute love or no love . 
These people are , for instance , passer - by A , friend B , Zhang Ziyi , good friend D , and also Furongjiejie . 
When we look at other people 's life , we are spectators . For other people , how can we not be the main characters of our lives as well ? 
This is as if despite my absence in the world , legends of me exist in it all along . 
People Ought to Have a Little Play Spirit 
Key word : play spirit 
It is a very tiring matter for people to live . Therefore , they should have a little play spirit . 
One should either laugh at oneself , or read other people 's jokes and gossip about other people . 
For example , one can relax a little at the " entertainment gossip " page at Tianya . 
People speak their mind there but of course , you should have the ability to know right from wrong because there are all kinds of nonstop " evils " . 
The result of " say what you please " is that you do not know what you have said either . However , you need to understand what you read . 
Xiao S called Cai Kangyong a " scholar " . 
If I am also qualified , then I belong to the type who have studied a bit but have not had a thorough grasp yet . 
Fortunately , I always know my limitations . 
However , I may as well get what I want while I do this bit of studying . 
It so happens that I like to take wild guesses as well . As a result , I think while I read . Yet , I have straightened out many reasons and have suddenly seen the light in many matters . 
Thus , I gradually form some habits , for instance , I tell myself to be a little tougher on myself and be a little nicer to other people ; 
when problem arises , first look to myself for a reason ; 
be more rational when handling matters and more emotional when treating friendship ; 
and to conduct myself in a low - key attitude , and handle matters in a low - key attitude as well . 
However , you know that no one is that good . People will always be selfish , always consider their success and failure , and always in an emotional mess when they should be rational but extremely goddamn rational while they need to be emotional . 
Yet , the good thing is that I never think of regret when I deal with choices that I made . 
It has been done and I accept the setback . 
Why do people have to think about so many useless things ? 
Fortunately , I am not the type of people who like to wear a stern look to raise my scholarly status either . I am also a philistine after all . 
The only difference between me and other people is that I do not have to be cynical . I am more rational in everything . 
Alternatively , for instance , I have particularly strong faith . 
Once I trust a person , then I believe that everything about him is good . 
Even if he has shortcomings , I will still willingly tolerate them . 
Even though I am not the type who gather friends around , I am the kind who put myself in their shoes and consider their interests . 
However , due to this reason , I am rather strict with screening friends as well . 
It is also quite beyond my understanding why so many people still have so much trust in what is said and done in the newspapers nowadays . 
Or perhaps in their mind , news stories nowadays still have the type of sacredness that they had before . 
However , there are still many things in this world that I do not comprehend . 
Joke . 
Slap myself in the face . 
Song Dandan 's The Depths of Happiness , Warm and Moving 
Key words : Song Dandan , The Depths of Happiness 
A while ago , I learned from the newspaper that Song Dandan had published a new book titled The Depths of Happiness . 
I wanted to read it very much . 
It was because I wanted to see how a woman at her age with such a profession sees herself and life after experiencing changes in family and career . 
It was not disappointing as expected . I had two thoughts after reading it : First , I was electrified . One can also see one 's shadow when watching the life of others . Second , I was greatly touched all the same . They were all details of emotional ties with family and the like . 
Why was I electrified ? 
In the book , Song Dandan wrote , " I have neglected a very important principle in life : Giving is happier than receiving . 
I am always busy with giving , busy with making myself happy . 
I am incapable of and know little about receiving . I have neglected to let other people give , that is , I have neglected the right + of other people to get happiness . " 
I discovered that I have always enjoyed this type of happiness as well . Perhaps I should pay more attention to it in the future . 
It requires considerable courage for a person to calmly face her past and display all these in front of everyone . 
Included in here were her first love , her failed marriage with Yingda , a deep self - examination , and the emotional tie to her son . 
There is also one more thing worth praising about this book . It is because being a publisher , it would definitely do its utmost to urge her to stress on things including I Love My Home , House of Flying Daggers , and a series of short plays with Zhao Benshan at the outset . 
However , I believe that she must have insisted . She only mentioned a little about Zhao Benshan in the end . As for House of Flying Daggers and I Love My Home , she hardly mentioned them . 
+ The entire book was full of the realization toward life , love , family , and emotional ties with family of a 40 - year - old woman . It was warm and moving . 
Busy Holiday 
Key words : holiday , busy 
It has almost been a week into my holiday . I have not been idle either . 
I attended a meeting at the college . In addition , I have to prepare the materials for next week 's meeting and the speech for the conference . 
I will be very busy during this holiday . 
If nothing unexpected happens , according to plan , I have three meetings to attend and four to five cities to visit . 
My life is suddenly filled with many same and different varieties of contents . I almost forget how I spent the holidays before . 
It seems that I have never been idle either as far as I can remember . 
Only that I originally had a long period of time for me to allocate at one point . Yet , the time seems less this year . 
Is it good or bad ? 
It will be more substantial when one is busy . However , if there is no result or gains for being busy , then its significance will be reduced . 
However , sometimes it seems that we cannot consider life completely based on results . Life is for us to slowly experience . Steadiness , peace , fullness , and happiness is also a kind of gains , even though this type of gains sometimes cannot be measured by standard of social judgment . 
Everyone needs to have firm belief in social value and personal value . What will we do if the two cannot coexist ? 
Marxism teaches us to put our priority on social value . It advocates individual to contribute to society . However , in reality , a healthy and sound society should also fully respect the wish and choice of value of individuals and create conditions for the realization of individual value . 
These suddenly came to my mind . I found out more and more that Marxist principles are indeed very effective . 
Yes , this is indeed what the theory says . However , when it comes to reality , people cannot help but still feel perplexed sometimes . 
Even when the realization of individual value does not interfere with social value , will any of us realistic individual be satisfied with the realization of our true self and + ignore social judgment ? 
Or , can our satisfaction derived from individual value break away from social judgment ? 
It seems very difficult . 
Therefore , while all of us try our best to be ordinary average people , we cannot help but to pursue extraordinariness and transcendence at the same time . Yet , we will always blame ourselves if we waste our lives . 
This probably is the social aspect of people . 
I am still somewhat more relaxed now that I am on holiday . 
At least I have time to watch VCDs and play for a while with ease . 
For what is worth , work still needs to be done and life will still be lived as before . 
I need to go to Xi 'an for a meeting again next week . 
A city that I have never visited but due to some " preconceptions " , I seem not to like it very much . 
I hope this trip can change my impression of the city . Haha . 
" Live a Very Feminist Life " 
Key words : male , women 's right , era 
Ying called me on the phone in the afternoon . We chatted for a while and we talked about me watching " Happy Male Voice " . 
Ying said , " No kidding ? You are so cute . You watched Super Female Voice and then Happy Male Voice . You are simply loyal viewer of Hunan Satellite TV . " 
I said , " That 's true . " 
Ying said that she had watched some talent selection shows of male contestants . She felt that all of them were feminine men . I felt the same . However , I told her that Happy Male Voice had entered the round of five . Next week will be the round of four . The contestants can sing really well and are all neck and neck . 
Ying , who studies mass culture and consumer culture , also said excitedly that she has to watch it next week as well . After all , the competition has reached the most crucial phase so it must be well worth watching . She can also accumulate some case resources for future study if she follows these things . 
We then said that this is an era of male charm . 
Men finally turn from " viewers " into " being viewed " while women , who were the objects in the past , have become the subjects . They can admire and face all kinds of men shows of this era of male charm from the angle of an observer . 
Ying said that it is female liberation . It is a sign of Feminism . 
She then went on to say , " Don 't you feel that you are living a very feminist life now ? " 
I was so happy after I heard Ying 's words that I laughed heartily . 
This statement itself was full of feminist implication , only that I do not have Ying 's good analysis ability to expound these things in a more profound and clear way . 
I like the singing of Chen Chusheng in Happy Male Voice very much . It has a very special sense of reality , a power that touches people 's heart and penetrates through space and time . It is very pure and comfortable ; 
The songs of Su Xing are of a wide variety . He put great expression in his performance . He has fine and gentle facial features but gives people a relaxed and lively feeling ; 
The singing of Zhang Jie is very resonant and powerful , especially the two songs titled Your Look and The Past Has Gone with the Wind that he sang in the competition today were both old songs that I like very much . They have left me with a deep impression ; 
Wei Chen has a cute and innocent face similar to Lu Yi . Allegedly , girls find it very likable . Of course , he also has good voice . 
The further competition of such final four should be very interesting . 
I look forward to watching their wonderful performances next week ! 
Utterly Confused Kimchi Mood of 6/29 
Key words : kimchi , Seoul 
Utterly Confused Kimchi Mood of 6/29 I turned on international roaming . However , once I disembarked the plane , it seemed that the battery of my mobile phone had died . There was still not a single signal bar . Perhaps the turf of global communications means the sphere of the heart . Moreover , it will be effective from the next billing date . 
I will lose contact with other people temporarily in these few days . Oh , oh , will anyone worry about me because of this ? 
I turned on secretarial paging just to prove who is thinking of me . 
Whether it is business or personal . 
However , the question is , then again , whose longing do I hope it will be ? 
I do not know when my heart started to turn blank again . 
I cannot understand why I always fail to keep the people whom I want to keep from leaving . Yet , some people whom I do not want to keep , they always assume that they can squeeze inside . Does it sound like I am talking about how I feel about marketplace ? 
However , the heart cannot be stuffed by " white gloves " whether there is a place for you or not , can it ? 
After all , material and heart still cannot be mentioned in the same breath ! 
Our car travels on the highway to Busan . 
The department head drives without saying a word . I have nothing to make conversation with either . 
After all , he neither speaks Chinese nor English . As for me , I also only know a few , a few broken English sentences . 
I look at the computer and strike the keyboard rather boringly . Inside the car , besides the sound of the keyboard , there is the cheerful GPRS navigation sound of the Korean woman . Everything is somewhat too quiet . 
Only the endless green and the grayish blue sky is left to be seen outside the window . 
It is rather unlike my personality to be quiet . 
To my surprise , the only thing in this country that gives me a warm feeling actually turns out to be English . 
The circles that come into view besides creating an effect of radioactive dizziness on me , they have no other function at all . 
I believe that South Korea will never produce compasses . 
It is because the market has no need for it . 
Seoul was very clean , thoroughly clean , scrupulously clean . 
However , unfortunately , the few days that I stayed in Seoul , other than work place and department stores , I did not have time to go anywhere . All my impressions were limited to looking around along the way . 
Fortunately , everything was still good ! 
South Koreans are polite in accordance with their tradition . They smile scrupulously and methodically , listen carefully , and are elegant and calm . 
All that I can notice are glorious appearances , traditional customs , ancient structures , and overly modest civilization . 
Is this hypocritical ? 
It might be better to be hypocritical . At least everyone is courteous ! 
One may think that hideous things do not exist if they cannot be seen . 
The food in South Korea is excellent ! 
Only that I dislike and cannot understand why they spend so much repeated efforts only to make kimchi into assorted hors d 'oeuvres with all kinds of things . Of course , there has to be seaweed . 
In second thought , South Koreans still have a profound knowledge in food . They can differentiate between kimchi that is pickled above ground or underground and the duration of the pickling with high accuracy . 
This indirectly signifies that the meticulousness of the South Koreans may have something to do with having kimchi all the time . 
However , I am worried how the Japanese tofu restaurant that the department head is about to take us to will integrate kimchi into its cooking again . 
When I thought about the Chinese cuisine that we had last night , I felt like crying . It was entirely Koreanized . The only thing that was palatable turned out to be kimchi . 
Oh , ah , thank you for the kimchi that the China Southern Airlines offered with the on flight meal . 
The airlines company must have thought that I have to get used to it from the moment I get on the plane . 
Two more days and I will return to my country . If there is still no one to miss , then I may as well think of the Pork braised in brown sauce that my aunt will make . 
After all , satisfaction of the stomach is more direct than satisfaction of the heart . 
Of course , it has nothing to do with kimchi . 
Two Trees 
Two trees , one was me and the other was my brother - in - law . 
We were each other 's shade and we took care of each other . 
People of my generation all have many sons and daughters . However , I only have older and younger sisters but no older or younger brother . As a result , the arrival of my brother - in - law sounded extremely important . 
We were all born poor children . We had to take part in multifarious chores and physical labor since we were very young . Even though I had tried my best to pretend to be a grown man all along and wanted to do the work as good as a connoisseur did , I never had the approval of my father . 
I have had problem of sleepwalking ever since I was young but it is not too serious . However , I could not avoid losing concentration when I did my chores . 
For instance , my father asked me to plaster the chimney of our old house . I climbed up the roof to operate quickly . 
The chimney was plastered but when it rained , the house was + leaking because I had crushed the tiles of the roof . 
Here is another example . My father asked me to change the light bulb , the old - styled incandescent lamp type . 
When I climbed up the chair , yet , the light bulb I was holding slipped out of my hand and fell to the cement floor , smashed . 
Examples like these are too many to be enumerated . Therefore , after my brother - in - law was admitted to the family , the odds and ends small jobs were naturally undertaken by him and were done extremely well and effortlessly . 
While for me , I gladly hid in the corner and read those leisure books that seemed like bricks . 
We later grew into two trees , two tall trees that could support the veranda of the family . 
As for father , he inevitably dwarfed . He , who sat on the wheelchair , became an obscure bush underneath the dense leafy shade . 
Who would have expected that the situation suddenly changed . My 50 - year - old brother - in - law suffered from serious illness all of a sudden . The tall tree that looked lush green and exuberant was actually , beyond belief , approaching the frightening death . 
On that summer day with dazzling sunshine that made people dizzy , outside the operating room of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital , the doctor mentioned casually , " It is not worth operating anymore . 
He can live for two more months at the most . " 
At that moment , I felt as if I was suddenly shot by a stray bullet . My soul left my body instantaneously . I was there panic - stricken like a fool . 
I started to sleepwalk again . I saw our family 's old courtyard and the young brother - in - law 's busy figure in it . 
It was my sister 's sharp cry that woke me up . I rushed to hold my sister who fell onto the hospital 's corridor . We , who were embracing each other , were all tears . 
The dazzling sun suddenly disappeared . I suffered from blackout spells . 
My brother - in - law soon learned about his illness after returning to our city from Beijing . He was relieved instead after he and older sister cried in each other 's arms . 
My brother - in - law started to arrange for his funeral methodically . For instance , he told his son , " Take good care of your paternal grandmother for me . After the venerable elder passed away , she has to be buried with your paternal grandfather . This is how the grave should be uncovered during burial . 
Visit your maternal grandfather often . Buy him some practical items during Chinese New Year . " 
For instance , he told my younger sister , " After I pass away , you need to visit your older sister often . She will be very lonely for sure all by herself . " 
I found as much time as possible to visit him . However , when he faced me , he looked very ashamed . 
Words failed ourselves all the time . We were like two plants that despite having life , could not converse . 
These were two grown trees . The tempering by trials and hardships had made us capable of facing adversities calmly . Was it still necessary for him to brief me on anything ? 
It seemed unnecessary . 
It was because you knew in your heart : After you passed away , my older sister , the children you had with my older sister , and this big family could only rely on me , this tree alone , to support them . 
Who asked me to be born a man ? 
As a man , you have to straighten your back and shoulder responsibilities without hesitation whether you want to do it or not . 
The only regret was : Why did your tree wither that early ? You should have a rich and verdant old age . 
You passed away on the first day of the New Year . 
You left by yourself in loneliness when Chinese all over the world welcomed the new spring with great joy . 
Perhaps , there is another young shoot of life emerging in another space and time ? 
N Minutes in Life 
The reason I have such seemingly trendy title was that at that grim despair moment , the confused brain was simply too busy to consider time . 
It was as if an innocent person received a ruling of death sentence for no reason . Would he still nit - pick on the grammatical errors in the arbitral award in a calm and leisurely manner ? 
It was a day in the winter . The youth settlement was very cold . 
I was not sure who was on duty either . The furnace had had no fire all day . 
Since it was said that there would be strong earthquake , we did not bother to make a fire when we went back to our place in the evening . 
On the big wide bed that sleeps 12 people , the four of us wrapped ourselves in cotton - wadded quilts . Under the dim light , we played poker " three on one " for meal coupon , quivering with cold . 
Suddenly , crushing rolls of noise traveled + from afar to near . The few of us looked at each other only for an instant . We immediately realized the arrival of disaster . 
We thus flung off the cards in our hands and leapt swiftly onto the floor . We passed through two narrow doors and piled out . 
The instant we ran out of the dormitory , the poor stone hut was grounded to dust in a twinkling . 
We , who rushed to the courtyard , were like standing on a rocking boat . We swayed back and forth like tumblers and were unable to steady ourselves . 
Within these few seconds , the structures around us + resolutely gave up their prudent image in the past . They emitted strange " creaking and babbling " cries and danced an almost crazy break dance one after another . After that , they committed suicide by turning into a strand of smoke and dust . 
Naturally , the power lines above us were unwilling to be left out of the limelight . They broke suddenly with a " snap " and scattered in all directions just like whips . 
Meanwhile , the evil earthquake that wrecked havoc was setting off celebratory fireworks for its creativity all around us . The multicolored earthquake lightning could rival the stage art effects of any blockbuster war movies . The rumbling earthquake noise sounded like battle drum that boosted the morale , torturing every weak nerve . 
I only had one thought at that time : The end of human beings has arrived ! 
I could imagine : The ground underfoot opens with a loud crash while boiling lava sends out blazing invitation as if it were steel . People drop into the lava one after another in free fall like nonentities . They are so stingy that they do not even have a trace of light smoke before they disappear in an instant . 
My spine had the wonderful numbness of being filled with ice water . In the gloom , the faces of the few companions were uncertain as if they were paper masks . 
I thought : Do human beings bid farewell to this colorful world just like this ? Will tens of thousands of years of history of civilization disappear from then on ? 
However , I am not even 20 years old . My flower of youth has just bloomed and I just felt the delight in being alive . I am so reluctant to leave my wonderful life ! 
My parents and my relatives , where are you all ? What are you all doing at this moment ? Are you still alive in this world ? 
At this moment when I face the repugnant smile of death , I miss you all so much ! 
...... I was not sure how much time had past . The muddle - headed me finally found out gladly : The earthquake sound was gradually weakening . The trembling of the earth was slowing down bit by bit while the fireworks above me no longer twinkled . 
A huge vessel that had been heaving in the stormy sea finally entered a peaceful harbor slowly . 
A young heart that was easily broken was eventually put back to its original place carefully after experiencing near insane atrocities . 
Earth , my home , you finally allowed us to feel the warmth and affection of a home again ! 
A warm feeling of surviving a disaster slowly filled the entire body from underfoot like a warm current . 
After getting a firm footing , Yu Doudou , who just turned 17 years old , suddenly wailed in the face of the desolate scene of the ruins of the courtyard of the youth settlement that was once harmonious and warm . 
All the people were infected and hot tears gushed down our faces . 
It started to snow . Was it mourning that fluttered for the misfortune of human beings ? 
That year , the earthquake in Haicheng killed 1,000 people . 
Expert said , " Fortunately , the forecast was in time . In addition , it happened before people went to bed . Otherwise , a major earthquake at a magnitude of ' 7.3 ' would have at least seized 100,000 lives ! 
Only a year later , the Tangshan earthquake that killed over 200,000 people happened . 
Matters of the Village 
There are many families in the village . Among which , the family called Nan is the most annoying . There is a famous saying that is very popular in the village : guard against fire , guard against theft , and guard against Nan . 
In fact , the Nan Family is still quite honest . 
Some others will usually steal a melon or something from other peoples ' fields while the Nan Family will steal a chicken or a dog at the most . It cannot be to the extent that the entire village is isolating the Nan Family . 
No one is clean . Whom did our Nan Family offend ? 
The Nan Family set about holding some honorable activities to make known that this village was first built by the ancestors of the Nan Family , that the Nan Family has always been a large family that grows food , that some famous people in history had also come from the family , and the family has made major contributions to the building of the village as well . 
At the same time , the Nan Family carefully invites the village cadres to look around and visit its home . 
In short , the entire Nan Family works hard and wants to fight an active battle and better itself . 
Not long ago , the Xi Family did a very shameful thing by cruelly persecuting Nan Family 's seedlings . 
The family named Xi made its name in the village by acting as a matchmaker . Young men from the village all benefit from the Xi Family . 
If not for the good matchmaking that Xi Family did , how could you families do well in your production ! 
However , this time , the Xi Family actually smashed Nan Family 's seedlings with black bricks at a place called Hongdong . It was indeed completely abominable . The entire village felt resentful and they all said that none of the people in the Xi Family is good . 
The Nan Family went to the Xi Family to demand an explanation . It had gained the sympathy of the entire village . 
The entire village all spitted at the Xi Family . 
As a result , the battlefield was moved to the Xi Family . 
The Nan Family determined to build a nice image before the 17th village meeting to make the Nan Family , the largest growing family , flourish . 
Even though the village cadres urge people to get along harmoniously everyday , this village named Zhong is never peaceful . 
The most disgusting thing is that in merely two to three months , even the pigs started to clamor and revolt in a hubbub and demand a higher status ! 
Two years ago , the chickens in all the villages suffered from a flu and they were all killed , weren 't they ? 
Pigs , why don 't you be smart ? 
If you continue to create an uproar and try to revolt , you will be unavoidably killed ! 
Yet , even though the Mei Village and the Ying Village that are used to treat people high - handedly live an abundant life , they are not necessarily peaceful . 
Isn 't it scary enough that some tramps knocked down the tall buildings of the Mei Village today and are going to throw small explosive cans in the subway of the Ying Village tomorrow ? 
As a result , people of the Zhong Village generally believe that even though it is sickening that they cannot afford to live in a room , visit the doctor , and go to school , they can cultivate land , work part - time , and build connections without worries . It is also entering a new era , of a sort . 
The Nan Family and the Xi Family , oh , which family does not have its share of troubles ? 
Let 's take the Wan Family who lives at a small bend southeast of the village as example . Even though the parents of the family are somewhat shameless , our great Zhong Village still defends this family as usual , doesn 't it ? 
Seeing that the 2008 sports meet of all villages will be held in our Zhong Village , please save the troubles and straighten the bad children in the village . 
All families , raise the lamps and make the fire . Oh , those who have money give money , oh , those who have labor power give labor power . 
When the time arrives , people will all go to the village public office to watch golden eggs laid into the nest ! 
( dubbing outside the picture , fading : golden eggs or silver eggs ? Fellow viewers , fellow viewers , I am Yongge , anchor of Cun Television Station ...... ) 
Eric 's View on Google China 
Key words : Eric , Google , Google , China Poster : ordinary staff of Google 
I am an employee who joined Google China relatively early . We have undergone many tests in the past two years . We had expected some of them when they arrived while others had indeed exceeded our expectations at the time . 
Yesterday , I learned that the company had a special chapter discussing its development in China in the financial report issued this quarter and I heard Eric answered a question regarding China by chance . I had all sorts of thoughts about this so I looked for it in order to encourage each and everyone one of us . 
This reply of Google CEO Eric to reporters ' queries at the Google Inc . Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call held last week ( http://investor.google.com/earnings.html ) showed that he was very satisfied with the current results that Google China has achieved and that he was fully confident about the future development of Google in the Chinese market . 
Eric said that we have outstanding talents in China , increasingly improved facilities , and a product line that continues to enrich its localization contents . 
He believed that even though the success of Google may not necessarily be at hand , it is an excellent start for Google China . In addition , drawing on the hard work of the Chinese team , the support of the headquarters , and unswerving spirit , he firmly believed that Google will make amazing achievement in China in the future . 
Yes . The important thing is that we keep progressing upward staunchly because we grow up here . We have deep feelings for this place . We strongly believe that Google should give China a lot more . It should give its users a lot more .

Strapless Mules 
Nowadays , top - less is prevalent in everything . Especially in the summer , everyone wish that he or she could just streak because any clothing will make people feel hotter . 
You might have known before that T - back , which had been popular for many years , was already defeated by G - String because the latter has absolutely no band . 
Therefore , in such an age , the mules you wear under your feet may very possibly be outdated as well because a brand new type of strapless mules that only have a sole have appeared now . 
How can one wear them if there is no strap ? 
We are not celestial beings and the manufacturer does not have magic either . 
This type of mules is directly ... glued to the bottom of your feet . This is not a product of prank but actual merchandize . The sale price is approximately US $ 13.5 / pair . 
This is yet another product that " I have imagined that it exists but do not expect that it actually does " . It makes people speechless . 
The manufacturer believes that this type of mules is very cool . You do not believe it , do you ? 
Please take a look : I feel extremely uncomfortable under my feet just by looking at them [ via F.C . ] 
Thousands of Beauties with Various Gestures @ Chinajoy from Engadget 
Key word : beauties 
The grand opening of the China Digital Entertainment Expo and Conference ( Chinajoy ) took place on July 12 . It had an average daily count of approximately 40,000 visitors . 
Many businesses in China participated in the exhibition . Majority of the presentations were on online games . 
I believe that audience of Engadget , which caters to mature audience , were more interested in showgirls than online games . 
Don 't be impatient ! The main course will be presented right away .

Lenovo Soon to Introduce High - end ThinkPad T61p 
Key words : Lenovo , ThinkPad 
The ThinkPad T61p that Lenovo is about to introduce on July 17 ( U.S . time ) , also the most advanced notebook computer of the T series , has given us a very pleasant surprise : UWB ( Wisair Ultra Wideband ) . 
That 's correct . Same as the R400 notebook computers , it connects to a wireless expansion slot with high - speed transmission capability . 
( via ) This style of 15.4 - inch notebook computer uses Santa Rosa processor and Nvidia Quadro FX 570M graphic chipset . Of course , the protection measure of a reinforced metal cage - shaped chassis of T61 will sure be included . Yet , the price is surprisingly inexpensive . It only cost approximately Renminbi 15,000 yuan . 
Watching Movies Without Screen , Mobile Phone Projector Picture Series Exposed 
Key word : mobile phone 
Iljin Display , a Korean - based company , had introduced a laser projector module that is only as small as a coin . 
Since the size of the module is extremely small , it can even be built into a mobile phone and a 7 - inch projection area can be seen on the wall . 
( via ) The traditional projector consists of three different LCD panels responsible for the output of the three different video signals of red , green , and blue . Meanwhile , this mini projector can convert among the three colors by using a single LCD panel alone , thus reducing the volume and production cost of the projector . 
An official statement claimed that the LCD panel of this type of projector itself is only 0.24 inches and can be easily integrated into a mobile phone . 
Currently , more than half of the mobile phones on the market have cameras built into them . I reckon mobile phones with built - in projector will appear on the market very soon . However , it is really hard to say whether the prospect of the market will be good or not .
