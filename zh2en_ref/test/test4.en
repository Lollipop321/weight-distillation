He indicated that the Northern Limit Line is illegal . 
The Northern Limit Line , located in the Yellow Sea , was drawn up by the U.S . army in 1953 at the end of the Korean War . However , it has become a bone of contention between the two Koreas and North Korea even refuses to recognize it .

Similar clashes erupted again in June 2002 and six South Koreans were killed . 
US Treasury Secretary Arrives in China to Visit , Environmental Protection and Exchange Rate As Key Concerns 
U.S . Treasury Secretary Paulson arrived in China yesterday for a visit . The United States is exerting all efforts in convincing China to further implement necessary economic reforms and environmental protection work , particularly the Renminbi exchange rate topic that had attracted wide attention . 
U.S . diplomat stated that Paulson visited Xining City , the capital of major Chinese northwestern province Qinghai , earlier . 
China is currently implementing a series of environmental protection plans near the largest salt - water lake in Qinghai Province . 
Paulson traveled to Beijing today to discuss with chief Chinese officials on topics including the acceleration of the process of the ' US - China Strategic Economic Dialogue ' initiated last year . 
The US - China Strategic Economic Dialogue mainly discusses economic and environmental protection issues with Renminbi exchange rate being the most important one . U.S . congressmen argued that the value of Renminbi is underestimated . 
The US - China trade deficit is soaring . Pressure inside the United States is increasing . Congressmen are preparing to adopt retaliatory measures to counter their so - called " unfair China trade policy " . 
Last week , the U.S . Senate Finance Committee overwhelmingly adopted a bill requiring the Treasury Department to identify list of nations with " fundamentally misaligned " currency exchange rate , thus opening a potential door to economic sanctions against Beijing . 
U.S . congressmen said that an undervalued Renminbi makes goods exported from China to the United States very inexpensive , thus intensifying the US - China trade deficit . The US - China trade deficit had reached US $ 232.5 billion last year .

Expert Believes that Insurance QDII Will Not Divert Domestic Stock Market Funds in Near Future 
Chinanews.com , July 30 
According to report of China Securities , the Interim Administrative Measures for the Management of Offshore Investments of Insurance Funds was promulgated a few days ago . Insurance funds thus have wider room for utilization in the capital market . 
Liu Lefei , Chief Investment Officer at China Life Insurance , believed that with the appreciation of the Renminbi and the strong domestic capital market , insurance institutions will not engage in large - scale offshore investments through foreign exchange purchase . This also implies that the Insurance QDII will not divert funds in domestic stock market in the near future . 
The report stated that many insurance institutions shared the same view . 
Expert stated that since a Renminbi derivative market still does not exist at the present moment , insurance institutions do not have adequate measures to avert risk . Therefore , conditions are not yet ripe for large - scale foreign exchange purchase . 
Liu Lefei said that in the long run , in the area of asset allocation , offshore investments should make up a considerable portion in the overall allocation of insurance companies . 
However , since the Renminbi has rather huge appreciation pressure at present , China Life Insurance will mainly utilize exchange funds that it has in offshore investments . 
Caution should be given to the purchase of foreign exchange for offshore investments under current situation .

Kao Chin - chih , " Director - General of the Department of Judicial Administration " in Taiwan , stated on the same day that judges in the island are behaving differently from what Chen Shui - bian described and demanded an explanation from Chen Shui - bian for his remark . 
According to report of the United Daily News of Taiwan , Chen Shui - bian raised doubts about judges , prosecutors , and investigators intervened , influenced , and even attempted to control the election campaigns of various party candidates out of political factors or consideration for the elections . He claimed that he hoped this situation does not exist in Taiwan but it may be extremely difficult . 
In response to the doubt of Chen Shui - bian , Weng Yueh - sheng , " President of the Judicial Yuan " in Taiwan maintained a low - key and did not respond while " Secretary - General " Fan Kuang - chun appointed Kao Chin - chih to speak for the Judicial Yuan . 
Kao Chin - chih stated that the Fundamental Law of Taiwan and the " judges ' rules and regulations " both proclaim in explicit terms that judges should transcend political parties and groups . They cannot participate in activities of political parties or assist in the campaign . Judges all follow relevant restraints cautiously . The Judicial Yuan believed that all judges have done well . 
Kao Chin - chih quoted an example by saying that Chang Sheng - hsi , judge of the " Kaohsiung Branch of the Supreme Court " , took part in the course offered by the Ketagalan Institute a few years ago . Since the related course had party flavor , the self - disciplinary committee formed by judges decided to take disciplinary action against him . 
Chang Sheng - hsi once wanted to run in the primary election of the Democratic Progressive Party but due to the controversy over running in the election while in office , he finally decided to give up . 
Kao Chin - chih argued that if it is for the trial of individual case , one can lodge an appeal to the court of higher instance . One cannot infer that judges have other political intentions solely based on the outcome of the verdict . 
Germany Plans to Lower Threshold for Attracting Talents 
This newspaper , Berlin , July 1 , ( Reporter Wang Huaicheng ) 
Schavan , German Minister of Education and Research , said a few days ago that Germany should lower the restrictions on the importation of foreign professionals in the Immigration Law to resolve the shortage of professionals in Germany through an increase in the importation of foreign talents . 
According to the report of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , the size of labor force between the age of 15 and 64 in Germany will drop every year till 2010 . 
If there are insufficient immigrants , Germany 's labor force in 2020 will be 6 percent smaller than it is now . 
However , reports of organizations including the Confederation of German Employers ' Associations and the Association of German Engineers showed that in current German labor market , the shortages in engineers and skilled technicalprofessionals are bigger . 
According to data from the German Federal Labor Office , as of this May , there was a shortage of approximately 12,700 people in the supply of engineers and a shortage of 9,600 people in the supply of technicians in the German labor market . 
In order to protect the employment of its nationals , Germany has set a rather high threshold for the importation of foreign talents . 
The German Immigration Law stipulates that the annual salaries of professionals from non - EU countries must not be lower than 85,500 euros , otherwise they will not be able to obtain a work and residence permit in Germany . 
Schavan suggested lower this limit to 40,000 to 60,000 euros . 
Don 't Have Blind Faith in Legal " Theoretical Circle " 
Article 8 of the draft amendment of the Law on Lawyers recently submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress for deliberation stipulates : people who have professional experiences in the research or teaching of law , with advanced professional titles or corresponding professional competence , may obtain a lawyer 's license , and get approval from judicial departments under the State Council . 
( June 28 , China Youth Daily ) 
There is a difference between the " theoretical circle " and the " practical circle " in law . The former mainly includes " abstract behaviors " such as the teaching and research of law while the latter are more " concrete behaviors " such as engaging in litigations , legal consultations , and legal services . 
The phenomenon of " scorning of each other " has long existed between the theoretical circle and the practical circle in law . The theoretical circle argues that the practical circle lacks necessary legal attainments and is simply mechanical " legalist " while the direction of criticism of the practical circle on the theoretical circle is that " theories cannot guide practice " . 
In regards to such a divergence of division of labor , what law can do is to remain neutral instead of supporting any one side with mightiness . 
However , the " chartered lawyer system " in the Law on Lawyers has objectively endorsed the judgment that the theoretical circle is superior to the practical circle in law . 
In fact , for some experts and scholars who engage in pure research and teaching of legal theories such as the history of legal system and international laws , no matter how thoroughly accomplished they are in theories , they will still be out of step with practical legal issues . 
In this case , chartered lawyer system has no doubt set a " bad precedent " with extremely harmful effects on the qualification confusion in the practical circle in law . 
The blind faith in the theoretical circle is not only limited to these . For instance , expert submissions and expert appraisal meetings always influence and even veto court verdicts . This phenomenon is also a direct manifestation of such blind faith .

Britain Lowers Terrorist Threat Level 
This newspaper , London , July 5 ( Reporter Guo Lin ) 
On the 4th , he British government lowered the terrorist threat level from the highest level to the " severe " level . This implies that terrorist attack in Britain is not imminent but attack is still " very possible " . 
Currently , the British police turn the scope of investigation to India and Australia . 
Since the eight terrorist suspects arrested all worked in the healthcare system , the government will conduct emergency background checks on foreign immigrants entering employment in the healthcare system . 
Allegedly , nearly 90,000 people working in British public healthcare system obtained their qualifications to practise medicine overseas . 
Prime Minister Brown also requested background checks on high - tech immigration applicants . Employers or relevant organizations will be requested to provide background information of the applicants . 
Don 't Let Peddlers Annoy People in Public Places 
Travel is to seek relaxation , relief , comfort , and to enjoy natural scenery and results of social civilization to the fullest . 
However , when traveling in China , many people encounter such an annoyance of being encircled , pursued , obstructed , and intercepted by peddlers and people engage in intermediary businesses in public places . 
When people getting on or off the vehicle , no matter car or train , they are always pestered by peddlers and some unlicensed middlemen . 
If they are not selling eggs , peanuts , and sesame seed cakes , then they are selling newspapers and magazines , and then the many unlicensed middlemen recommending restaurants and hotels , and even selling fake documents and fake invoices so on and so forth . 
If you turn him down , he can follow you for a few hundred meters and act very much like to win or die . 
Many visitors also feel the same in some scenic spots . 
People come to peddle things such as travel souvenirs and small handicrafts and things like that before one enters the door . 
The situation increases once one enters the door . No matter how bright one 's mood is , it will still be spoiled and one will feel insipid . 
The media once reported that many foreign visitors to Xi 'an spoke very highly of the scenic spots and historical sites of Xi 'an . However , they could not understand why heaps of peddlers were allowed to peddle everywhere . 
Public places such as stations and scenic spots are originally places where journey embarks or for leisure . Good manners and order , as well as peace and harmony should be stressed to provide visitors with a comfortable and relaxing environment . 
Not only does the come and go at will of the peddlers disturb visitors ' mood , objectively , they have disrupted the public order of these public places and caused visual and environmental pollution , and at the same time , it also provides conditions and opportunities to lawbreakers to incite trouble . 
The important thing is that these public places are the windows of local spiritual civilization . Seen one and you have seen them all . What is being damaged is not only the issue of image , it also affects the economic development of the area . 
Imagine , you want to make tourist industry a success but greet guests from all over with this dreadfully disordered tourist environment . Who still wants to come ? Who still dares to come ? 
How can your tourist economy produce returns ? 
With the arrival of peak travel season , top priority should be given to the creation of a civilized travel environment for visitors from all over . 
Public places are not markets . The operating behaviors of peddlers should be regulated . Unlicensed operation should be adamantly abolished and illegal activities should be firmly suppressed . 
Only a civilized and orderly environment will enable visitors to come gladly , to return after fully enjoying themselves , and to revisit with excitement . 
In a few words , do not let peddlers annoy people in public places . 
" Reward for Voluntary Surrender of Low - Income Subsidy " Fails to Stand Close Scrutiny 
The Jianguomen neighborhood office in Dongcheng District , Beijing handed out items such as refrigerators as rewards for 12 low - income subsidy recipient families that voluntarily surrendered their low - income subsidies . 
( The Beijing News , July 10 ) 
The author is happy about the improvements in life of these families . However , I have mixed feelings about the wording of " voluntary surrender of low - income subsidy " and the practice of " giving out rewards " . 
Vice - chairman of Jianguomen neighborhood office said , " In order to address problems including defrauding low - income subsidy and so on , encouraging voluntary surrender of low - income subsidy is to set an example for other low - income subsidy recipient households . " 
If this example encourages other low - income subsidy recipients to turn the corner through efforts of their own , then it is indeed worth promoting . However , if one wants to use this to " inspire " people who have been defrauding low - income subsidy for a long time , then it is somewhat naive . 
The work to differentiate and straighten up real and false low - income subsidy recipient households should rely more on the law . 
Relevant departments should strengthen responsibilities that low - income subsidy recipient households need to fulfill when enjoying low - income subsidy : For example , inform changes in number of family members and income in a timely manner , report employment situation , and subjected to regular review . Meanwhile , relevant departments should step up efforts in supervision and inspection . 
After all , only the " surrender of low - income subsidy according to the law " is the long - term plan . 
Who pays for the material rewards given to families that surrender their low - income subsidies by the neighborhood office ? 
As a level - one government agency , the expenses of the neighborhood office are shouldered by financial appropriation . 
Then , should this sum of taxpayers ' money be spent ? 
On the one hand , families that surrender their low - income subsidies have proven that they have certain abilities to be 'self - sufficient " . On the other hand , aren 't there still people who apply for low - income subsidy ? 
Government appropriation that is labeled as life - saving money should render timely help instead of making what is good still better . 
Liu Gangyi 's ' I Am Willing to Serve Others ' Remark More Credible 
On July 10 , Liu Gangyi , the first Secretary of the township Party committee publicly nominated and directly elected in the country and the Secretary of the Party committee of Mulan Town in Xindu District , Chengdu City was subjected to democratic evaluation for the fourth time since he took office . He had an approval rating of 97 percent . 
In the conversation between Liu Gangyi and the reporter , Liu Gangyi defined himself as " one who serves others " . 
( Yesterday , the Beijing News ) 
The " one who serves others " that Liu Gangyi referred to is perhaps more truthful and convincing than " the one who serves others " referred to by some appointed cadres . 
The biggest advantage of public nomination and direct election over appointment system is that it is mainly ordinary Party members and the people who determine the origin of the power of the former while the latter is mainly appointed by higher - level organizations , whereas the direction from which power originates has established that the former must give accountability to the people top priority . 
The origin of power and to whom one is responsibleare fundamental factors in deciding how an electee conducts his work . 
Some people challenge that such a " democratic evaluation " is more like a " democracy show " . 
My opinion is that having such form of democratic evaluation is better than not having any . 
Given considerations to the history and current situation of the building of democratic politics at the grassroots level in China , I believe that direct public election is already a major breakthrough . Democratic evaluation is an important component of this unprecedented undertaking . It should not be underestimated in the advancement of building democratic politics at the grassroots level . 
India Expects to Elect First Woman President , Analysts Say Possibility of Winning Election is High , Woman Voters Hope for Higher Status of Women 
On June 23 , Patil put her palms together before filling out the presidential candidate documents . 
The presidential election in India has begun on the 19th . The new president will emerge between the incumbent Vice President Shekawat and Pratibha Patil , the governor of Rajasthan who resigned not long ago . 
Patil is the first female presidential candidate in India 's history . If she is elected , she will become India 's first woman president ever . 
Patil is the presidential candidate of the ruling Congress Party while Shekawat is from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party . 
Since the Congress Party has the upper hand in the presidential election , the media and the people all suspect that Patil has a relative high possibility of being elected . 
Patil , 72 , was the woman governor of Rajasthan . 
She was a lawyer and joined the Congress in 1985 . She is seasoned in politics . During her term as the governor of Rajasthan , she had received high opinions from the government . 
She also devotes herself to social welfare and is the honorary chairman of many cultural , educational , and social welfare organizations . 
Analysts pointed out that the reason Patil became the candidate was that she has pledged her allegiance steadfastly to Sonia Gandhi , the Chairman of the Congress Party . 
In India , the Gandhi family has been controlling the ruling National Party for a long time . 
Patil has the support of many woman voters , who believe that Patil will rebuild the image of women and raise their status in India where the conception of discrimination against women is serious . 
The Constitution stipulates that India is a federal state . The president is the ceremonial head of the state and the chief commander of the armed forces . He / she does not represent any party or organization and is more of a symbol .

This newspaper , Washington , July 22 ( Reporter Xu Qisheng ) 
U.S . President Bush stated on the 21st that the United States will offer full support to the Pakistan government in the expulsion of the " al - Qaida " and Taliban extremists from regions bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan . 
In the routine weekly radio address on that day , Bush said that based on the latest U.S . intelligence , the al - Qaida has found a " safe haven " in regions bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan . 
He was " very concerned " with this . 
Bush said that the United States will continue to support Pakistan President Musharraf . He also believed that Musharraf will persist in the battle against the al - Qaida and Taliban militants . 
The National Intelligence Estimate recently released by the United States pointed out that Muslim militant groups , especially the al - Qaida of Bin Laden still poses continuous threat to the United States . 
The agreement to prevent the activities of surviving Taliban forces and al - Qaida members that Musharraf made with tribal leaders in Northern Pakistani regions last September has not produced the expected results . 
The tribal leaders " were unwilling or unable " to defend the safety of the regions themselves . 
In this pre - recorded address , Bush stated that Musharraf is taking active steps to correct the mistake .

Climate Change Causes Rapid Decline in Alpine Glaciers 
This newspaper , Geneva , July 29 ( Reporter Liu Jun ) 
Glacier experts at the Swiss Academy of Sciences found in a longitudinal study that the more than 1,800 glaciers in Switzerland are declining at an average annual rate of 3 percent between 1850 to 2005 . 
The heat wave in 2003 alone had caused 1.8 percent of Alpine glaciers to melt . 
Experts believed that if global temperature rose by 3 degree Celsius by 2100 , the glaciers would be 80 percent less than today . If global temperature rose by 5 degree Celsius , then the glaciers would be completely melted . 
The Aletsch Glacier is the longest glacier in Europe . It has been inscribed by UNESCO into the World Heritage List . However , it had reduced by 100 meters in just one year between 2005 and 2006 . The protection of natural environment has reached a point that demands immediate attention . 
The picture shows the 23km - long Aletsch Glacier .

Alarm Bell Tolls " Connects with " Hong Kong to Celebrate 10th Anniversary of Return to Homeland Together from Afar 
On July 1 , the alarm bell in the Nanjing Jinghai Temple Memorial Hall was tolled again , giving out melodious chimes . 
The heavy historical echo " connected " the Mainland with Hong Kong through television station . Residents of Nanjing shared the moment with Hong Kong compatriots from afar to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of the return of Hong Kong to its motherland together . 
At midnight on July 1 a decade ago , 155 alarming bell chimes reverberated in the sky above the bell tower of the Nanjing Jinghai Temple Memorial Hall , a farewell to the humiliating history of the ceding of Hong Kong Island . 
People from all circles in Nanjing gathered in front of the small memorial hall . They said that they wanted to toll the alarm bell with their own two hands to warn themselves and descendants never to forget about history . 
" The alarm bell is 1.842 meters tall while 1842 was precisely when the Treaty of Nanjing was signed during the Opium War . 
The shoulder of the bell is 1.997 meters tall and 1997 was the year when Hong Kong was returned to its motherland . " 
Wang Fengling , the person who designed and cast the alarm bell that very year , explained , " Five narrow patterns of the character 'wan ' go around the body of the bell . The entire copper bell uses high relief with two dragons holding up the fireball to symbolize that Hong Kong is the ' Pearl of the Orient ' of the motherland . In the end , plum blossom , the city flower of Nanjing , is used as contrasting patterns of the body of the bell . " 
Yu Xiaodong , member of the democratic party who was the first person to suggest building the alarm bell that very year , said with emotion , " Before you knew it , it has already been 10 years since Hong Kong was returned to the motherland . " He hoped that the future of Hong Kong can be " bright , melodious , and continue forever " just like the bell chimes .

Russian Security Service Charges Exiled Magnate Berezovsky with " Conspiring Coup " 
Borovkov , attorney of Russian magnate Berezovsky who is in exile in London , announced on July 2 that the Russian Federal Security Service has formally indicted his client with a new charge by accusing Berezovsky of " conspiring to stage a coup with an attempt to seize political power in Russia by force " . 
Borovkov said that during an interview with a reporter of the Guardian in Britain this April , Berezovsky announced that he was preparing to mount a " palace coup " in Russia and confirmed that he was providing financial support to representatives of the Rightist elites who opposed to the policies of the authorities . 
The Investigation Directorate of the Russian Federal Security Service immediately initiated a criminal case against Berezovsky under Article 278 " forcible seizure of power " of the Penal Code of the Russian Federation and formally filed a corresponding charge with Moscow 's Savelovsky Court recently . 
Allegedly , the Russian Office of the Prosecutor - General had filed a criminal charge against Berezovsky in February 2006 with the same evidence that the exiled tycoon confirmed in an interview his attempt to seize political power in Russia by force . 
Since Berezovsky had been in exile ever since and could not be extradited , Russia temporarily terminated the investigation of the case in January 2007 . 
On July 2 , Moscow 's Savelovsky Court began the hearing of another criminal case against the exiled magnate . The Russian Office of the Prosecutor - General charged Berezovsky with embezzling Russian airline Aeroflot of ¡ ê 214 million in capital and laundering ¡ ê 16 million . After hearing the evidence , the court decided to postpone the court investigation to July 12 . It will assign a state - appointed defense attorney for the defendant here . 
Berezovsky argued that these are all " farces " and clearly prohibited his defense attorney to take part in the court hearings .

The two men , both 25 , one named Sameeh al - Hotari was sentenced to eight years imprisonment with forced labor , another named Mohammed Shehada was sentenced to three years imprisonment with forced labor . 
Court officials said that al - Hotari was also charged with illegal possession of firearms . The police found an assault rifle while searching his residence . 
The court initially decided to sentence al - Hotari to life imprisonment but later considered giving him a chance to " repent " and reduced the sentence term to eight years . 
The indictment said that the two defendants decided to avenge Muslims who " suffer from the Americans " after the War on Iraq broke out . As a result , they plotted attacks against Americans who live in Jordan . 
In August 2006 , they finally locked in on an American who lived in the suburb of the Jordanian capital of Amman . However , the police arrested them before the attack against the American was carried out .

Significant Increase in Adverse Reaction Reports of Diabetes Drug Avandia 
According to reports of U.S . media on the 15th , the number of reports on adverse reactions caused by diabetes drug Avandia such as heart attack has significantly increased in the United States in recent days . 
The U.S . Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning this May suggesting diabetics to take precaution in taking Avandia because scientists published a study report in the May 21 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine stating that this best - selling drug will greatly increase patients ' risk of heart attack and death rate . 
Doctors and patients thus paid close attention to the safety of Avandia . 
Statistics showed that within approximately a month after the safety warning was issued , the U.S . Food and Drug Administration received 357 reports on adverse reactions caused by Avandia , 38 of which were reports of death . 
While in January and February this year , the Food and Drug Administration only received 50 and 73 cases of adverse reaction reports respectively . 
These adverse reactions range from minor one of having blisters to serious one of sudden death from heart attack . 
However , drug experts at the U.S . Food and Drug Administration believed that it is now still too early to draw a conclusion that Avandia is unsafe . 
The Food and Drug Administration will hold a hearing on the safety of Avandia on July 30 . 
Avandia , an insulin sensitizer , was introduced in 1999 . It is suitable for treating type II diabetes . 
There are approximately 6 million diabetics worldwide who have taken or are currently taking Avandia . 
GlaxoSmithKline , the British manufacturer of Avandia , has always considered Avandia safe and 'has more benefits than harm ' for the patients .

An official of the U.S . Department of Defense said on the 23rd that due to the War on Iraq and changes in global situation , the U.S . Department of Defense is reconsidering its plan to cut approximately half of the U.S . troops in Europe formulated in 2002 . 
U.S . media quoted a Department of Defense official as saying that since the War on Iraq is still going on and the US - Russia and US - Iran relationships are deteriorating , the leadership at the Department of Defense raised doubts about the feasibility of the plan to cut the troops in Europe . 
In 2002 , the then Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld announced that the United States would reduce the original 113,000 troops in Europe to 71,000 by 2012 in order to build a new " small and elite " army . 
The number of U.S . troops in Europe is currently reduced to 100,000 . 
However , Craddock , commander - in - chief of U.S . European Command , submitted a report to the current Secretary of Defense Gates in June questioning the above reduction plan . 
The report said that while the U.S . troops in Europe are being reduced , many troops are be rotated into Iraq and Afghanistan to fight , thus causing a shortage in U.S . troops in Europe . As a result , they cannot cooperate normally with their European allies . 
The report suggested a halt to the plan to cut U.S . troops in Europe . 
Relevant experts in the United States argued that the above phenomenon shows that the prolonged War on Iraq has disrupted the original adjustment plan of the U.S . army .

Three Functions of Modern Army Uniforms 
The first is its identification function . 
An important mark to differentiate between armies of different countries , between different services and arms , and between the army and the civilians . 
Even though army uniforms have basically the same use among armies of over 100 large and small countries in the world , no army uniforms of any two countries ' armies are identical . 
The second is its symbolic function . 
To a certain extent , army uniform is a reflection of the spirit and distinctive feature of a nation . It also fully reflects the fighting ability and the soldiers ' quality of a country 's army . 
In the three major types of army uniforms - dress uniform , service uniform , and combat and training uniform - there is nothing like the crisp and beautiful dress uniform that can fully display the might of the country and the army . 
The third is its protective function . 
With the rapid development in new and high - tech weapons and equipment , to enhance the comprehensive protective ability of new and high - tech combat and training uniforms so as to provide army uniforms with various functions including bulletproof , counter - reconnaissance , chemical - proof , germs - proof , radiation - proof , as well as temperature , dampness , and air adjustments has become the priority in the development of army uniforms .

Brigade Party Committee Dares to Handle Difficult Issues with Persistence 
This newspaper , Chengdu , July 3 
Reported by Qu Yimao , Yang Ruiyu : " We must thank the brigade 's Party committee for its determination and courage in the eviction so that we can live in an apartment . " 
Today , more than 10 cadres of a communication training brigade in Chengdu Military Area Command who moved into apartments were all beaming with joy . They were full of respect and gratitude for the earnest and courageous way " the group " at the brigade Party Committee handled difficult issues . 
A few years ago , with personnel changes , some of the apartments in the residential building of the brigade were illegally occupied which caused a shortage in accommodation for cadres in active service . The officers and soldiers had quite a few complaints about it . 
The brigade had tried evictions a few times before but due to various obstructions , nothing was settled every time , thus turning this into a complicated and long - pending problem . 
" As long as one is persistent and reasonable , all problems can be resolved . " 
After the new Party committee group reached a consensus , the key leadership started to thoroughly straighten out all problems of illegal occupation of apartments themselves . 
On the one hand , they resorted to emotional appeal through reasoning and hoped that the people involved would consider the big picture . At the same time , they clearly explained relevant policy stipulations on apartments , houses built by collected funds , and utility apartments of the army , and declared the Party committee 's determination , principles and position . 
For people who had housing elsewhere but were unwilling to return the illegally occupied housing , the Party committee immediately contacted the units to which they belonged and adopted corresponding measures to urge them to voluntarily cooperate with the work of the brigade . 
After two months of meticulous work , all residents in the barrack site who had illegally occupied the apartments moved away on time . All cadres in the brigade who were in active service were given housing according to the rule . 
The persistent and courageous work style of the brigade Party committee also created a chain effect . The few cadres who were unwilling to positively cooperate with the assignment of the organization in the beginning all indicated that they will follow the decision of the organization now .

People 's Armed Forces Department of Jingjiang City Builds Platform to Elevate Qualities of People 's Armed Forces Cadres 
This newspaper , Reported by Staff Reporters Cao Jiawei , Zhu Chunbin : On June 18 , in the training class for cadres of the Department of People 's Armed Forces in Jingjiang City , Jiangsu Province , the tutorial To Win the Psychological Battle under Information Conditions taught by Lu Yuqing , chief of the Xilai County Department of People 's Armed Forces , was well received by all students taking part in the training . 
This was the new change brought about by the concentrated effort of the city 's Department of People 's Armed Forces to elevate the comprehensive qualities of the cadres of the Department of People 's Armed Forces through charging them with heavy tasks in accordance with reality of their positions . 
In the beginning of the year , during grassroots research , the Party committee of the Department of People 's Armed Forces found that some cadres of the People 's Armed Forces had long term of service and held too many concurrent duties , thus failed to focus their energy on doing armed forces work . 
To this end , they adopted measures including centralized training , coaching seminars , and reliance on training offered by local Party schools to provide regular training to cadres of the Department of People 's Armed Forces and concentrated efforts on resolving issues including the narrow range of knowledge and one - dimensional professional qualifications of the cadres of the Department of People 's Armed Forces . 
They integrated central tasks and boldly assigned duties to cadres of the Department of People 's Armed Forces , charged them with heavy tasks , and elevated their work abilities through on - the - job training . 
At the same time , they actively coordinated with local organizations and departments and jointly formulated the Program for Cadres of the Department of People 's Armed Forces to Compete for Job Positions that clearly stipulated that chiefs of the Department of Armed Forces must join the team of Party committee at the same level and not to hold other concurrent duties ; 
they established the adjustment and exchange mechanism for cadres of the Department of People 's Armed Forces . For cadres of the Department of People 's Armed Forces who are relatively old and cannot adapt to grassroots armed forces work , they made adjustments and exchanges immediately . For compatriots who had good comprehensive qualities and strong work abilities , they promoted and employed them . 
Not long ago , Chen Yisong , Secretary of the New Century Shipbuilding Co . , Ltd . Department of People 's Armed Forces , led the technical detachment of the militiamen in the innovative development of underwater ship welding technology that filled the gap in the country . He was promoted to the chief of the company 's Department of People 's Armed Forces as an exception . 
Good Start Still Needs to See Things Through 
The 2 - 2 score was reasonable and was acceptable to the Chinese team if judging from the result of the game alone . The key was that the process of the game was somewhat regrettable . 
If the Iranian team led by 2 - 0 , then the Chinese team tied the score , that would definitely make Chinese fans feel very differently . It would bolster a lot of morale . Unfortunately , the situation was precisely the opposite . 
Fails to see things through can be considered as an old problem of the Chinese team . 
The Chinese team never knows how to play under excellent situation . The general opinion is that mentally Chinese players are not tough enough . 
This is indeed a reason that the Chinese team fails to " see things through " . 
However , judging from the game that the Chinese team played today , it seems that it is not necessarily so . 
Not only had Sun Jihai , Sun Xiang , Shao Jiayi , and Zheng Zhi played in Europe before , Li Weifeng and the others are also battle - hardened veterans . They are experienced and knowledgeable . Theoretically , there should not be any problem with their mental qualities . 
This time , the Chinese team was regrettably pressed to tie with the Iranian team . The reason was probably the ineffectiveness in moving players on the field . 
The Iranian team substituted two people while they were trailing behind and the situation was immediately improved . 
The Chinese team also substituted three players in the second half but the outcome was not good . 
In order to overcome the problem of not seeing things through , one must find the root of the problem . 
As long as one identifies the problem , means to resolve it is probably not hard to find . 
The only worrisome thing is to try to find a cure indiscriminately for an emergency . 
If the situation continues like this , no matter how many more games the Chinese team plays , it will still commit the same mistake . The continuous progress that people expect as it plays more games will be out of the question .

Education Cooperation Zones in Small , Scattered , Remote , Independent Units Begin Operation at Second Artillery Base 
This newspaper , reported by Xue Bingjian , Reporter Xu Yeqing : The phenomena of difficult organization , limited resources , and lack of coordination in education encountered by small , scattered , remote , and independent units will become history for a base of the Second Artillery . 
The reporters recently learned that after half a year of pilot , the base promulgated the Enactment Measures to Implement Ideological and Political Education Syllabus that cover several ideological and political education cooperation zones in all small , scattered , remote , and independent units at the base . The measures are officially in operation . 
In order to promote the effective implementation of the Ideological and Political Education Syllabus , the base allocated resources to conduct an in - depth survey on the ideological and political education situation in small , scattered , remote , and independent units in the beginning of the year . They sorted out key issues that affected and restricted the time , personnel , and effects of the education and initially formed the new educational model of cooperation zones for small , scattered , remote , and independent units . 
The details of the cooperation zones are , break away from the restrictions of authorized force of the units , and designate a unit at the brigade or regiment level in a sub - area where small , scattered , remote , and independent units are relatively concentrated to take the lead to conduct standardized planning of thematic education . Units under different affiliations will attend classes together nearby or to hold long - distance discussions by means of video system . 
They adopt the practice of integrating teaching rotation and competing for job positions to conduct consolidated allocation of education force . Education hardware in the sub - area is put under centralized use . Information and data of all units , as well as education experiences are shared and exchanged . Report tours by model sub - areas and sharing of educational experiences among officers and men are regularly organized . 
Each cooperation unit has set up full - time education contacts and part - time education information gatherers . 
On this foundation , all cooperation zones have also established systems for seeking help in difficult questions , discussions on major educational topics , notification of emergency ideological situations , and examination and assessment . 
Zhang Shengmin , chief of the Political Department at the base , told reporters that the establishment of political education cooperation zones both reduces waste in educational resources and deepens educational effects . 
Some political instructors worry that they will lose points in front of officers and men from outside units , so they take the initiative to learn new knowledge and explore new educational methods . 
Officers and men being taught also actively digest educational contents in fear that they will sound unprofessional in front of officers and men from neighboring units during discussion , differentiation , and analysis . 
In this case , the enthusiasm of both the educators and the ones who receive the education is effectively stimulated .

Reported by Wang Weiqin , Special Correspondent Li Deying : On July 25 , the reporters saw at the combat support company of a unit under the Jinan Military Command that a notification board with important matters including calls for bids on projects of the unit , financial expenses , promotions of cadres , and admittance of warrant officers to the Party written on it was hung at an eye - catching spot in the display window . 
According to Political Commissar Su Chengsen , this is a concrete measure that the unit adopts to advance the system of open work style . 
Early this year , in order to strengthen the building of Party 's style and of a clean government , the Party committee of this unit formulated measures including the Two - Way Supervision between State Organs and Grassroots and the Notification of the Public on Sensitive Matters . They requested decisions on major issues that involve personal interests of officers and soldiers and the building of the unit to be made after seeking opinions from grassroots soldiers as well as disclosure of the entire course of work including standards applied , procedures , and results based on the situation . 
The unit has set up a suggestion box and notification board , as well as established a " message board " on the LAN to gather opinions and suggestions of the people on a large scale . 
The soldiers ' dormitory renovation project began at the beginning of the year . Before the project started , the Party committee solicited opinions from officers and soldiers extensively and then released bidding information and implemented open bidding . 
The measure had saved fund and won the support of the officers and soldiers . 
Openness and fairness in work has promoted the formation of good morals at grassroots . 
In this unit , whether they are major matters such as determination of central and sensitive issues or minor matters such as going home to visit relatives or taking vacation of an individual and daily expenses on food accounts , the grassroots companies still insist on notifying and announcing the matters regularly and subjecting to public monitoring conscientiously . 
( International ) Research Links Atrial Fibrillation to Two Gene Mutations 
Xinhua News Agency , London , July 2 - Icelandic scientists ' research revealed that people who have two gene mutations in their bodies have a much higher risk of suffering from atrial fibrillation than normal people do .

The study also found that while one of the genes can raise people 's risk of prostate cancer , it also lowers their risk of type II diabetes . 
( Sports ) U.S . Veteran Goalkeeper Keller May Retire after Copa America 
Xinhua News Agency , Maracaibo ( Venezuela ) , July 3 ( Reporter Liu Jian ) 
According to report of Venezuelan media on the 3rd , during an interview here , the 37 - year - old veteran goalkeeper of the U.S . team Keller stated that if he cannot find a suitable club to play for after the Copa America , then he will choose to retire . 
" If four or six weeks after the Copa America ends I still can 't strike a deal with a top level football team that would allow me to play another season or two then retirement may be a good choice . " 
With Moenchengladbach relegated to Germany 's Second Division , Keller also left the team that he had played for for more than two seasons . 
Even though Keller intends to retire , he , who is " yet to be married off " , apparently is not worried about the next employer . He said frankly himself that currently , as many as eight clubs intend to invite him to join them . 
However , the veteran goalkeeper , who had played in the Spain 's First Division League , the English Premier League , and the Germany 's First Division League , stated that his final decision rests on his family , " My child is nine years old already and he followed me to three different countries and studied in three different schools . My choice now must seek what 's the best for my family . " 
In the Gold Cup Final that just ended recently , Keller had a stellar performance and helped the U.S . team won the championship . 
In the Copa America this year , he was still entrusted with important task by head coach Bradley . However , one man alone cannot win . The U.S . team , which went to battle with " young guards " , was simply no match for strong South American teams such as Argentina and Paraguay . The goal that he kept was penetrated seven times in two games . 
The next game against the Colombian team will very probably be the last performance of the U.S . team and Keller in this year 's Copa America .

China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Corp. Ltd . , the " employer " of 13 pilots who resigned , claimed a huge compensation of 105 million yuan against them . This labor dispute case involves the biggest claim ever in Hubei Province . 
The Hubei Labor Dispute Arbitration Committee is currently hearing the case . 
In May , 13 pilots working for the China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Corp. Ltd . resigned one after another . Their resignations were declined by the company . 
Soon afterwards , in early June , the pilots submitted applications for labor arbitration with the Hubei Labor Arbitration Committee successively requesting a ruling to terminate the labor relations with the China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Corp. Ltd . 
After the China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Corp. Ltd . received the Notice of Charge , it filed a counterclaim demanding the 13 pilots to pay the company for damages ranging from over 6 million yuan to 10 million yuan respectively incurred by the violation of agreements in the labor contracts and the termination of the labor contracts with a total of 105 million yuan . 
It was learned that the contracts the pilots signed with the China Eastern Airlines were ones without fixed time limit . Unless termination conditions or renunciation conditions agreed upon in the labor contracts appear , the labor contracts will be effective until the pilots reach legal retirement age . 
The Hubei Labor Arbitration Committee will hear and handle the case together as an appeal and a counterclaim . The hearing is expected to end by August 8 . 
( International ) Germany Calls on Russia 's Early Adoption of Latvia - Russia Border Agreement 
Xinhua News Agency , Riga , July 12 ( Reporter Yang Dehong ) - German Prime Minister Steinmeier who is currently visiting Latvia urged Russia on the 12th to adopt the Latvia - Russia Border Agreement as soon as possible . 
Steinmeier held talks with Latvian Foreign Minister Pabriks on the same day . The two parties mainly discussed issues including the Latvia - Germany relations and cooperation between Latvia and the European Union .

In the press conference after the talks , Steinmeier called on Russia to adopt the Latvia - Russia Border Agreement as soon as possible . 
Steinmeier said that the paces of the improvement in the Latvian - Russia relations and the relations between the Baltic countries and Russia are relatively slow . The signing process of the Latvia - Russia Border Agreement had witnessed the course of development in the Latvia - Russia relations . However , " the shadow cast over by history " may also cause the Latvia - Russia relations to retrogress again . He hoped that Russia can carry the Latvia - Russia Border Agreement as soon as possible to facilitate the advancement of the relations between the two countries . 
On March 27 of this year , after a 10 - year - long negotiation , Latvian Prime Minister Kalritis and Russian Prime Minister Fradkov signed a border agreement between the two countries in Moscow . 
On May 17 , the Latvian Parliament passed the Latvia - Russia Border Agreement . 
According to reports of Latvian media , the Russian Parliament will deliberate on the agreement in the near future .

( International ) Hyundai Motor Denies Intention to Acquire Volvo 
Xinhua News Agency , Seoul , July 18 - A spokesman of South Korean - based Hyundai Motor stated in Seoul on the 18th that the company had no intention in acquiring Volvo or any brand under Ford Motors . 
A few days ago , the Sunday Times and the New York Times both reported the news that Ford may put Volvo up for sale . 
The Sunday Times even claimed in its report that the South Korean - based Hyundai Motor is a potential buyer of Volvo . 
Spokesman of Hyundai Motor said , " We have no interest in acquiring Volvo , Jaguar , or Land Rover , " " Hyundai is busy with implementing our own expansion plan at the moment and have absolutely no time for anything else . "

In March , Ford , which was in the red , sold Aston Martin under the PAG for 848 million US dollars . Last month , it also said that it was considering selling Land Rover and Jaguar . 
( Sports ) Cuba Complains about Overly Short Boxing Ring Ropes 
Xinhua News Agency , Rio De Janeiro , July 21 ( Reporters Chen Weihua , Leng Tong ) 
The Cuban team complained on the 21st that the boxing ring ropes at the Pan American Games were too short and would affect the performance of boxers . 
According to the rules of the International Boxing Federation , the length of boxing ring ropes should be 6.1 meters long in international matches . However , based on the measurement of Pedro Roque , coach of the Cuban boxing team , the boxing ring ropes at the Pan American Games were more than 1 meter shorter than the standard . 
Roque said , " We filed a formal protest because this does not just affect the country of Cuba but involves all the people . 
If the ropes are too short , it will affect the sidestep movements of boxers . " 
He also said jokingly , " If they cannot find ropes that meet Olympics standards in Rio , they can find them somewhere else . 
We would have brought them from Cuba if we had known . " 
The Mexican and Colombian teams also expressed dissatisfaction with the length of the boxing ring ropes on the same day . 
Even though Colombian boxer Julio Deibis won the first game , he said , " Even though I won the first game , the boxing ring was too narrow and it really made me feel uncomfortable . "

( Sports ) Flowers Alter Flowering Season to Blossom out in " Off Season " for Beijing Olympics 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , July 28 ( Reporter Cui Junqiang ) - When the Olympics is held next year , the hot and humid August in Beijing is expected to become an ocean of fresh flowers . 
Scientists and researchers have found sound strategies to add colors to the Olympics through technical means including altering the flowering season and so on . 
In the project acceptance meeting of the Applied Research in the Selection and Cultivation of New Species of Summer Olympics Flowers held in Beijing on the 28th , judging experts concluded that by adopting the forcing and retarding new culture technique , varieties or species of flowers with different natural flowering season can bloom in the summer at the same time and will achieve the best visual effects in August when the Beijing Olympics is held . 
One can usually see only a dozen types of full bloom fresh flowers during the summer in Beijing . Most flowers have either withered a long time ago or are still far from budding . 
Through hard work , Scientists and researchers have chosen 206 varieties and more than 400 species of Summer Olympics flowers . 
In the 2007 Olympics Flowers Exhibition held in the Haiding Park in Beijing , a batch of flowers painstakingly cultivated by Scientists and researchers that could not naturally bloom in August in the past will greet visitors with bright flowers around the one year Anniversary of the countdown of the opening of the Beijing Olympics . 
( International ) Turkey 's Ruling Party Wins Parliamentary Election 
Xinhua News Agency , Ankara , July 30 ( Reporter Wang Jian ) - The final result of the 23rd parliamentary election announced by Turkey 's Supreme Election Commission on the 30th showed that the ruling Justice and Development Party won 341 out of the 550 seats and obtained the right to form a one - party Cabinet again . 
In the parliamentary election held on July 22 , the Republican People 's Party , the main opposition party , won 112 seats . 
The Nationalist Action Party won 77 seats in the election . 
Besides the three parties aforementioned , 26 independents were also elected as congressmen . 
The new session of the Turkish Parliament will hold its first meeting on August 4 . 
At that time , all members of Parliament will be sworn in and will begin to carry out their duties . 
After that , the Parliament will elect the new House Speaker in form of secret ballots . 
The parliamentary election in Turkey was originally scheduled to be held in November . However , since the Opposition Party boycotted Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Gul , the only candidate and a Justice and Development Party member , in the presidential election at the end of April , and led to the failure of the presidential election , the parliamentary election was thus held ahead of time . 
Am Worried CCfD " Uproot Corruption Deadline " Campaign to No Avail 
[ Old Zan Skeptic ] " Send Text Messages " and " Table View " submitted on 2007-07-02 at 14:41:10 
On May 30 , the Central Commission for Discipline set a time limit on June 30 , that is , one month from now , for corrupt elements all over the country to voluntarily admit their dishonorable ways before being arrested . 
Upon hearing of this , we humble people at the grassroots cannot help laughing out loud . To catch thieves , the police issue an ultimatum asking thieves to voluntarily confess to their crimes before a deadline one month away . Or else they 'll be arrested . Can you find any anti - corruption campaign of the same pattern ? 
Isn 't that tantamount to a clear , public announcement telling corrupt officials in advance to flee at once and to doctor the criminal evidences to avoid punishment ? 
What is the intention ? 
Isn 't that .. .. sigh , what can I say ! 
Or , if we assume the campaign may be productive , what effect can it achieve ? 
Can it instill fear into the corrupt officials and deter them ? 
We do not rule out the possibility that some timid ones might come out and voluntarily confess . But wouldn 't many many more just run away ? 
Let 's not ask whether the deadline set by the Central Commission for Discipline will produce clear effect . Just watch for the possible side effect in a different direction that this campaign would likely produce . 
That is : the corrupt officials ' gratitude toward the Central Commission for Discipline . Corrupted officials fully understand the situation and secretly feel the joy of going scotch free from any punishment . 
One month would be more than enough for them to transfer and squirrel away their loot . 
If I were a corrupt official , absolutely , I would also see things that way . Definitely , neither would I go to your place and voluntarily report everything . 
Corrupt officials , after reveling in joy and gratitude , will behave themselves this way . Ha , ha . very gratefully ! 
Common folks are all confused . What happened to the anti - corruption campaign ? Why can 't we push forward with all the powers of hurricane and thunder ? Why is it so difficult to strike out resolutely ? 
What results can we expect from an anti - corruption campaign like this ? 
Honorable members of the Central Commission for Discipline , all in all , I am wary and worried over the effect your " anti - corruption deadline " will produce . 
No Private Land Ownership Is Minimum Acceptable to My Calm , Rational Self 
[ Zen Buddhist Teacher Duchi ] [ Send Text Messages ] and [ Table View ] posted at 10:34:39 on July 2, 2007 . 
Not to privatize land ownership is the last line of defense I could accept with calm and ease . 
I think I am not easily angered . At least I myself feel this way . 
I have always been calm and rational when speaking on forums , I seldom lose my composure and make irrational remarks . 
Also I have kept my profound faith in , and fervent expectations of the Party 's Central Committee . I accept decisions the Party Central makes to push through reformation policies and measures , no matter how wide is the difference between them and my beliefs , and I consider them as one of the " characteristics " . 
But , once land ownership begins to be privatized ( or be privatized in substance , if not in name ) , all the above will not hold true any more because their raison d 'etre will no longer be valid . 
Rather suffer the loss of a thousand troops than lose one inch of national territory . Land is the country 's greatest and most precious social resource . 
The working masses and the land are the fundamental elements of a country . 
As long as the nature of its land resources remain unchanged , a country will not easily change her own basic nature and attributes . Once the land resources changed its basic nature , the change alters everything that is fundamental . 
I am not a Communist Party member , but I clearly remember the following pledge I have sworn to : " Love the motherland , love the people , study diligently , improve and strengthen myself , and be ever ready to offer my strength to serve the course of Communism ! " 
" Study diligently , work hard , suffer the hardships at first and enjoy the fruits later . Strive for the course of communism ! " 
Those who , like me , have made this pledge and sung loudly these words " We belong to the next shift in socialism , " should remember what they have sworn to , if they are not wretchedly shameless . 
If you have already gone back completely on your pledge , please stand up in all honesty and move yourself away from " Communism . " Don 't hang on to this plaque for the purpose of hoodwinking the masses on the one hand , and on he other hand , trying hard to figure out a way of selling the plaque off at a good price . 
Of course , I wish that all such concerns and worries were unnecessary , and I can keep my composure and rational behavior . 
Do remember that " we belong to the next shift in socialism . " 
What would happen when there is no more next shift ? 
One Generation , Feeling of Two Ages 
Not long ago , someone brought up this question : Of 30 - year - olds , are there some pro - Mao Zedong people ? 
Later , it was changed to 20 . 
The fact is : people of these age groups did not live through the Mao Zedong era . Those who asked this question either have poured water into their brains , or are afflicted with inherent dementia . 
In the city , the most qualified spokespersons of the Mao Zedong era should be those who lived through these years in person and suffered all the miseries of that era , in other words , people born between 1950 and 1960 . 
After they were born , their parents plunged into political movements , thus failing to provide the children love and care corresponding to their needs . 
Just when they needed proper nutrition , natural disasters arose and lasted for three years . The children suffered much of the pains of hunger . 
When starting school , they met head on with the Cultural Revolution that wiped out opportunities of schooling for many years . 
For some , it even cut short their schooling for life . At 15 to 17 , their schooling still had a long way to go . But they had to abandon their study in order to answer the call of the Party to " climb the mountains , go to the countryside and support the constructions on the frontier . " 
After starting their work , they were proud to become members of the worker class and volunteered for the heaviest and most exhausting jobs . 
Glory for that moment , but misery for the whole life . 
When it was time for them to get married , late marriage , late child - bearing and the one - family - one - baby policy also started from them . 
When their pay was due to be raised , businesses started to put more value on school diplomas . And their chance for a raise was crushed because they had no diploma . 
After they worked hard to bring up the offspring , paid for its basic education and saw the child passing a university entrance examination , there was the reforms of the education system and the state - owned enterprises , college tuition went up and they lost their jobs . 
As they got old day after day , illness and disease began to take a toll on their health . Unfortunately , this also coincided with the change and reform in the nation 's healthcare system . This means : illness could not be treated since they could not afford to pay the medical and hospital bills . 
It is obvious that a total lack of social justice ruthlessly descended on this generation . 
But among people of this generation , not so many have joined the camp opposing Maoism or attacking Mao Zedong . 
Why ? 
They are not Mao 's slaves , but men of flesh and blood who constitute the real and living groups of humanity in our society . Through their life of climbing the mountains and going to the countryside down to the loss of their jobs , these people lived and experienced in person our history and that is the social phenomenon of two historical eras . 
In spite of the school closing , the deplorable shortage of food and clothing and numerous other ills of the society in the Mao Zedong age , which aroused their grumbling and even hatred , they still consider the Mao Zedong years as good and as a time of high nationalism , superior ethical and moral life and of unsurpassed social environment and traditions . 
Parents of some of our friends on the internet belong to this age group . You might do well to have a chat with them .

" Injection for Watermelons , " " Cancerous Bananas , " and " Cardboard - Filled Buns " 
[ Barren Plain beyond Northern Borders ] [ Send Text Messages ] and [ Table View ] posted at 22:02:57 on July 19, 2007 . I remember a news item of the year before last reporting that chemicals were injected into Hainan watermelons , resulting in the melons rotting on a massive scale in the fields and enormous losses to the melon growers . 
Later , CCTV followed up with reports that thorough investigation proved there was absolutely no such a thing . 
That report sounded strange in the first place . For injecting something into big watermelons one after another lacks any practical and meaningful justification . And , considering the amount of work , it would prove an impossible task . 
Memories of things happening last year are much clearer . Media reports said banana plants in Hainan were infested with a disease similar to cancer that afflicts people . Such diseased banana plants could hardly survive . 
Consequently , many people were misled to conclude that consuming bananas leads to cancer . The end result is the same : banana price collapsed ; and , lamenting out loud , banana farmers cried and cried even after all tears were exhausted . 
The reason that the two above reports were so sensational lies in the fact that they directly touched people 's most sensitive nerve cords , namely , the issue of food safety . 
If public media reported that certain foods are detrimental to health , the report is bound to spread far and wide from one person to ten and from ten to one hundred . As to the truth and substance of the report , people generally would rather take them seriously as credible than brush them aside as not trust - worthy . To one individual consumer , skipping a few Hainan watermelons and / or bananas from his diet is , after all , only a bagatelle . But to the grower and wholesaler of the produce , it is immeasurably important . 
Not long ago , a case of unsafe food exploded on the Beijing media scene . As pork price increased steeply , some people used treated cardboard paper as filling to make steamed buns for sale . This was the so - called " buns of cardboard filling . " 
I was roundly shocked upon hearing this report . I felt that these small hawkers are too good at their R&D work that they devised such a method to cheat the consumers . Furthermore , I spread the news far and wide and warned my families and friends not to buy steamed buns when they go on the street . 
But yesterday , again reports suddenly sprang up to say that the story of " buns of cardboard filling " was a fake . And the whole thing was fabricated by one person . Thereupon I felt relieved and at ease . But , at the same time , I also began to wonder : What exactly is ailing our media today ? 
The true story I got from reliable sources runs like this : Mr. Zi , a temporary staff member on " Transparency , " a program on the lifestyle channel of the Beijing Television Station , purchased ground meat filling , wheat flour and paper cartons on the market and arranged for some people , one of them named Wei , to use the meat and the cardboard paper , after pulping the latter in water , to make steamed buns . 
Zi stage - managed and filmed the bun - making process with digital video equipment he himself brought along , edited the film and got it on the TV program by hook or by crook . 
Now public security authorities have detained suspect Zi , and will deal with him in a stern manner in accordance with the law . 
After the cardboard bun story broke into the open , concerned and responsible offices and departments were immediately and rapidly organized by the government to look into the matter . A thoroughgoing and all - embracing inspection in the breakfast foods market in Beijing was conducted in order to ensure the safety on the dining tables of the common folks . 
After the truth behind the incident was firmly established , the Beijing Television Station learned a deeply ingrained lesson and tendered open apologies to the public at large . It also sternly investigated and dealt with the responsible people and will further improve management and control in order to stop up loopholes and block false , distorted and fabricated news reporting . 
Only , although the cardboard buns are proven to be non - existent , when public confidence will be restored so that people would again go to street stalls to buy steamed buns without fear remains a question mark . 
The whole thing also shows , incidentally , that the government has assigned top priority and taken immediate and rapid action to solve problems related to food safety issues . It also demonstrated with considerable clarity that the dining tables in Beijing homes are still relatively safe . While the cardboard buns scare turned out to be a false alarm , it also could be considered a reminder and admonition to the public at large . 
To Whom Should Education be Responsible ? 
Recently , I heard friends in China talk about what they sew at a school . I cannot help speaking out about some of my concerns . 
The incident occurred in a private high school in the city of Shanghai , the Southwest Weiyu Middle School . 
The school decided to assign its best teachers to three classes comprising students who signed a contract to move up inside Southwest Weiyu from middle school to high school . To other classes whose students consist of those transferred to Weiyu from outside and / or those who signed no contract to move up inside Weiyu , several young teachers whose pedagogic track record was not good and who had no experience teaching the third high school grade . 
The reason is : those students who signed the agreement agreed to give up chances to take entrance examinations to other high schools , so best teachers should be given according to the assurances agreed and promised . 
As to the students in several other classes , the school expressed this attitude : Young teachers should be given opportunities to improve themselves through practice . 
I just cannot help lamenting , to whom is education responsible ? 
I remember that many years ago , when I attended a key high school , our whole class , dissatisfied with the pedagogic performance of a math teacher , boldly , perhaps even recklessly , signed a joint petition , asking that the teacher be replaced . 
Afterwards , school authorities did replace the teacher . For the school promised that all individual students are considered equal and the school is responsible to every one of them . 
Ten years ago , I came to the United States to pursue post - graduate studies . 
One year , in the summer , we were choosing what courses to take in the fall . I found that our department offered , in electives , all theoretical courses , but not one application - oriented practical course . 
I went to talk to the department chair , telling him that there is a problem with the curriculum . 
The department chair admitted that the lack of application - oriented courses was due to insufficient faculty strength . After a couple of years when there is available faculty , such courses may become available . 
I remember telling him then : " This is your problem , not mine . " 
From Shanghai , I traveled thousands of miles to come to study in your esteemed school , precisely because I was attracted by your brochure introducing me to the courses you offered . 
If you were unable to offer these courses , then , refrain from putting them on the brochure . Otherwise , it would be false advertisement , not accountable to me and to my family . 
Having heard my opinion , the department chair thought for a while and said : " OK , let me see what we can do to solve the problem . " 
Maybe it was too late , because all courses were already offered for online registration . 
After three weeks , the department chair called me in for a talk , telling me mainly that his job was to assume responsibility to all and every student , including me . 
He accepted my suggestion and did his best , that was to add two strongly application - oriented practical courses . He hoped that I could understand . 
After this happened , I took several courses taught by the department chair . 
He never harbored any prejudice against me for the views I expressed . In every course I took , he very impartially gave me an A. 
Before my graduation , I heard his secretary 's remarks on how he did his very best for all his students , but not every one of them were grateful . 
At the commencement ceremony , when speaking as the valedictorian , I told the department chair that every one thanks him from the bottom of our hearts for all he did to help us . For he did his best to assume responsibility to every one of us . 
I felt that I made a correct choice of my life to come here and study . 
When uttering these words , I saw tears the department chair tried to hide in his eyes . One day , if every Chinese educator and the whole education system dedicate themselves to be responsible to every student , I think , the real take - off point of the nation will not be too far ahead . 
Central NY Men 's 4s Volleyball Tournament 
Last Sunday , I took part in the men 's 4s volleyball tournament in the central New York state . Spending six and a half hours playing the matches , our team finally won the championship . 
This tournament , in fact , was organized as a training session to prepare for the volleyball tournament of the Empire State Games . 
The coach broke up four men 's teams ( high school and college teams plus teams of 35 - year - old - and - over as well as 45 - year - old - and - over players ) from the central regions of New York , then reorganized the players into teams of four members each . Every team was assigned one middle blocker / setter to proceed with the matches . 
The rules of the tournament were quite interesting . Only players in the rear row were permitted to go on the offensive and the ball must not drop into the 3 - meter zone . Only one player , the middle blocker , was allowed to go to the net to block the opponent 's offensive . No position rotation among a team 's players was permitted . 
Hence , it was basically a test of the power of the offense and the positioning of the defense . 
Our team had a setter , who was two meters in height . His attack was at once powerful and from a high vantage point . In the whole match , he was responsible for more than 60 % of the offensive action and scoring . We also had one 1.85 - meter middle blocker who single - handedly frustrated many enemy offensive actions on the net , 
and a 1.9 - meter wing spiker who made many mistakes in his offensive action for he was positioned in the rear . 
Then there was me , a 1.75 - meter ace spiker who often sneaked up for a surprise attack . My scoring ratio was fair . I was mainly responsible for catching crosscourt smashes from the other side . 
There were altogether seven teams . They started with a round - robin in which our team won the first match . Then , the referee repeatedly called our foul for our setter 's stepping on the line when staging an offensive . Our morale was thus greatly depressed , leading to the loss of three matches in a row . 
But after the loss , we all regained our poise and our coordination stabilized during these three matches . Then , we began to win one match after another . 
At the end of the round - robin , our team won three and lost three matches to rank ourselves a sixth . 
Following that , supplementary matches began . Without the top - ranking team , the second to seventh teams competed one against another in a game of elimination . 
Our team stayed calm and stable psychologically and in tactics . We worked hard to overwhelm our opponents and led the field in qualifying for the semi - finals . 
In the semi - final matches , the opponent has a strong offense and weak defense . They afflicted blue and purple bruises on my arms . But , once safely catching a hard spike , I got out of it a kick that was twice as satisfactory as my own successful offensive action . 
We were not even aware of the final score when we won the game . 
Our opponent in the final match had a balanced offense - defense . We won many points by our serve and lead the game all the way . 
At the very end , we were comfortably leading with 21 to 24 . Then , two powerful serves in a row by the opponent flew wild after I touched them . The score : 23 to 24 . The setter of our team ran over and told me : Nothing to be concerned , it 's only a couple of points . 
Then , another ball was flying in my direction . Not too bad , I received it safe and sound . Then , our middle blocker passed it backward to the setter to bring about a smashing spike and the battle was over . 
Again on Morality 
Much has been said about morality as it bears on the free and unattached individual . 
In this regard , I have nothing more to add . 
Now , I wish to address myself to the question of morality for the collective entity . 
We often see the occasion when collective life and activities are essential . 
On such an occasion , a collective body needs to maintain certain moral standards . 
We can often find that collective entities which achieved success can boast of their virtues and morality . 
That does not come about by chance . 
For the causes or activities , one needs to overcome the difficulties confronting it , and its constituencies need to close ranks . I think , high moral strength , besides faith and creed , plays a vital role that cannot be neglected . 
At the very least , we can safely predict that a group of people of low moral standards will not succeed in any worthy task . 
This might because that , for a collective entity to achieve success , an essential quality is the wisdom that sees long - term interest through rational far - sightedness . 
In fact , a collective entity often establishes its identity through a wide variety of ways such as logos , trade jargon , creed , and morality . 
Only by taking brandy in the morning and in the evening , can we see the ground blanketed by orchid flowers all along the Road of Life . 
[ Discussion ] Up to Now , How Many Times True Happiness Occurred ? 
A very close high school friend of mine finally obtained a visa . At the end of August she will be able to start her journey to pursue graduate studies in an extremely good college on the west coast of the United States . 
Today , several school friends had a small get - together . All were so happy to see her dreams come true . 
Seeing her so happy , I felt really envious . 
Think of all the years up to the present , I was that happy only when I passed the entrance examination to high school . Up to that time , I never dreamed that I could succeed in the examination to enter the top or second ranking school in the entire city . Afterwards , between then and now came college and workplace which followed in due course and never gave me the same joy again . 
The university I was admitted to was not the one I dreamed of entering . Hence , not much pleasure to speak of . 
In the college years , all my hopes lie in the possibility of going north after graduation so that I could join my boyfriend , with whom I fell in love for two years then . 
But fate plays games with you ! One month before my graduation , he asked that we go our separate ways . All the dreams I cherished up to that moment exploded like a bubble . 
Afterwards , I returned to the north to take a job . Today , I have been on the job for two years and have built up enough savings to buy a medium - priced car . But throughout it all , I have not experienced again the happiness that once did descend on me . 
Today , when chatting with my good friend , I can understand and feel her happiness . After struggling gallantly and working with a tremulous heart for one year to prepare herself , she finally goes abroad without a hitch to start a period of new life . To experience a dream coming true really makes one happy . 
I have no plans to pursue further studies and do not like living in a foreign country . For I had worked for half a year abroad which led me to believe that living abroad does not suit me . 
Witness the happiness of a good friend cannot help leading me to think : what am I pursuing ? 
What will be able to make me experience , once again , the happiness of yore ? 
Possibly , it is to find someone who truly likes me and wishes to live with me through the second half of our lives . 
I think I will then cry out emotionally , just like what my good friend described to me of her uncontrollable burst into tears when she sailed through the embassy interview and received the approval notice . One year of work and worries finally brought the reward . 
But , what about me ? 
Time and again I did my best to manage , with a tremulous heart , my emotional life . When will I be rewarded with the realization of my dreams and cry out once to my heart 's content and delight ? 
Perhaps I do not have much ambition , for I never , from the beginning to the end , worry about my career . But , what about my emotional life ? 
When will I find an emotional home ? 
I am very distressed when dealing with this problem . 
What about you , my brothers and sisters ? 
Up to this moment , how many times have you encountered genuine happiness in your life ? 
Promote Architecture College of Southeast University 
Ah , ah , count the following as my briefing for the Southeast University alumni on the College of Architecture of their University . 
I am presenting the most recent first - hand information . Authenticity is guaranteed . 
Dean Wang , Party Secretary An , teacher Li of the Personnel Office and other faculty members of the Pedagogic and Research Section of Architectural Technology attended the briefing and reporting session . I talked for an hour followed by discussions by all participants for another one and a half hours . 
After the formal reporting session ended , teacher Zhang ( Assistant to the Dean ) pulled me aside and asked me to a closed - door talk with him in an office to the rear of the compound . 
Very friendly and approachable he told me behind closed doors that some things could not be discussed at a formal meeting . He said it was obvious that I did not have any idea on my income here in the future . Hence , he told me some concrete cases of earnings and income of faculty members of the College of Architecture , to ease my anxiety . 
Before the formal reporting session , Dean Wang gave an introduction to the Colleges of Architecture . He said that only six important architecture disciplines were offered in all institutions throughout the country , namely , two in Southeast University , two in Tsinghua , one in Tongji and one in Tianjin University . None is offered anywhere else . 
He said in recent years , energy saving of architectures , green architecture and architectural technology have gained special attention in the nation . Southeast University wanted to bring in a faculty member specialized in these fields . 
He said they received resumes from more than 20 applicants for this job . They were from domestic sources , Japan and the United States ( I was the sole applicant from the U.S . , it seems ) . 
The College of Architecture considered the matter vital and conducted serious investigations on the applicants . 
Compared to the architecture colleges of other higher educational institutions that I know , Southeast University certainly is a front runner . While Tongji University may be placed much higher than Eastern in city planning , the latter is likely a bit better in architectural design . ( I did not know that then . ) 
The College of Architecture has been designated one of the colleges vital to the National 985 Engineering Construction Plan . In the past two years , it has been very well provided financially , said Dean Wang . 
He told me that Southeast University was allocated , at one throw , ten million yuan of development and construction financing last year . Of this amount , 3.5 million was to be used directly to replenish the specialist technological library of the College . ( Wow , to this , I must sing a song of praise : What generosity ! ) 
The remainder is nearly all used on installation and equipment of the specialist laboratory that I proposed . 
It is said that to this project several academicians expressed variant views . 
ha , ha - - while on the subject , I might as well say that I think they paid too much for some imported equipments . 
One set of equipment to conduct experiments to measure air - tightness of a room is widely used in the United States where its cost is definitely below 500 US dollars . Southeast University finally spent RMB 50,000 to acquire it . 
There are yet other situations worth reporting , many departments and colleges of the Southeast University have moved to the new campus in Jiulonghu . But the College of Architecture has made a firm decision to stay put , professing that its student should remain in a superior architectural environment . There are still some architectural classics on the old campus grounds , while the new campus is completely barren of them . 
ha ha - It seems that since other departments have moved away , the College of Architecture requisitioned an additional building . 
Hence , Dean Wang told me right off that an exclusive office could be assigned me later on . 
It caused me some embarrassment later for this offer made by Dean Wang did not arouse any emotional reaction in me when it was received . 
Afterwards , I was told by teacher Zhang , who pulled me aside , that this offer did not come easy . For office space was in real short supply and some senior professors had not been assigned their own yet . 
This made me extremely uneasy . It seemed that I had very little idea of the background of the situation in this country . 
All in all , this trip to Southeast University is very pleasant for me . I am highly and favorably impressed by the dedication , enthusiasm and friendship of the leadership and responsible faculty members of the College of Architecture of the University . 
I wish Southeast University will sail smoothly and rapidly forward on the road of development , and its College of Architecture will maintain a good lead ahead of its sister institutions !

All Good Things have an End 
Two weeks ago I had lunch with colleagues to see off our ex - boss . 
The boss can be called a woman of extraordinary capabilities . She was very nice to us , her subordinates . We also worked willingly and happily for her even in evening and weekend overtime hours , which is rare in the States . She could very well be the best boss I ever had . 
Because of her wish to take care of the family , and to have more time to educate her children , she left the company and opened up a mathematics learning center for elementary and junior high school children . 
I believe she can succeed in everything that she takes up ! 
Sun Yanzi Brings Love and Care to Africa , Suffers Sandstorm , Stoning and Scratch Wound ( pictures ) 
Taking Care of Sick Children 
Showing " Muscles of Mice " 
After Congo , Sun Yanzi joined the World Outlook Conference for the second time to travel to Niger , Africa . 
At a press conference yesterday , she admitted frankly that it was the most exhausting trip she had ever undertaken in her life . 
The local weather was extremely hot and the drinking water was muddy . When visiting the city market she was met by crowds throwing stones in protest . Even when she rode a camel its saddle chair left a scratch wound on her . 
Dozens of incidents happened along the way , causing her to cry out loud repeatedly in her mind : " How I wish to go back home ! " 
She was shocked seeing malnutrition in children . 
Having joined the " Care for the Impoverished Children " campaign of the World Outlook Conference three years in a row , Sun Yanzi calls herself a senior spokesperson of the campaign . 
She has brought along 30 bottles of vitamins , 40 flashlights and 500 pieces of candy to share with the local children . 
She said , accumulated experiences told her no matter what quantities of small gifts one brings along they will never prove to be enough . 
The most serious problem encountered in Niger is that the mothers there know absolutely nothing about bringing up their children and the children suffer from serious malnutrition problems . 
When on an 8 - hour , 500 - kilometer journey from the capital city of Niger to the small town of Tawa , Sun Yanzi experienced a sandstorm which is rare in that area . 
Stormy winds carried sand mixed with rain water . The entire sky changed color with the turbulence of the storm . 
The jeep she was riding in swung wildly with the winds . 
Recalling that time , Sun Yanzi is still trembling with fear left over from that day . Though she was inside the car , she still could not help feeling scared . 
Afterwards , only when she heard indigenous folks say that sandstorms symbolize good fortune , she felt somewhat relieved . 
Together with Local People 
Lamenting Difficulties Plaguing Local Mothers in Rearing Children 
Upon her arrival in Tawa , local officials staged a welcome ceremony which featured single hump camels . Sun Yanzi was invited to mount a camel to acknowledge the loud applause and salute of the local welcoming crowds . 
But the camel , scared by photographers ' flashes , went out of control . Sun Yanzi was almost thrown down to the ground . 
Finally , she herself dismounted . But her dress was caught and torn by the saddle , leaving a bloodied scratch of some 8 centimeters on her back . 
On this visit , Sun Yanzi visited four sick local children who suffered from serious malnutrition . One of them was a baby four months of age weighing only 2.1 kilograms . It did not look like a human baby at all . 
Sun said : " My heart aches when I saw the baby whose condition was really grotesque . But the mother should be responsible . Mothers there should be taught the right ideas and ways of nutrition for their children . " 
Key to Education in China - - Humanistic Orientation 
Key terms : Key to Education in China - - Humanistic Orientation Key to Education in China - - Humanistic Orientation 
The purpose of education is : to make the educated capable of existing and of enjoying themselves in the present social environment with greater ease . 
" Existing " - - This is a concept easily understood by all . As to " enjoyment , " people perhaps understand it to be simply " play and entertainment . " In fact , it is not so . " Enjoyment " signifies many categories of concepts and events . 
" Existing " includes growth and strengthening of physical and mental capabilities . 
1 . Growth and strengthening of one 's physical capabilities - - Through sports , one can enhance physical power , ability of coordination , and constantly improve mobility to satisfy one 's own need of moving about as well as the social need of dealing with the society . 
2 . Growth and strengthening of one 's mental capabilities - - One can achieve clearer understanding of the society one lives in , as well as knowledge of the self . One learns to master ways of dealing with other people , and acquires the skills of adapting to one 's existence , and of enjoying life . 
The above is a discussion of the purpose of education which does not really bear on the theme of this writing . Now , let 's talk about the point of emphasis : Key to Education in China - - Humanistic Orientation . 
Human nature means : one should fully understand that each individual differs with the other . None should be viewed and treated in the same way as stereotypes . 
[ Original Article of the Club ] : Usual Stages of Learning Buffett 
Original Article of the Club : Usual Stages of Learning Buffett 
1 ) The first stage : First contact with Buffett rewards one with the feeling of pocketing a sovereign treasure . Immediate application of what one learned follows . However , at this point of time , superficial and half - baked knowledge frequently leads to wrong approaches , incorrect application and blind alleys . Good harvest may appear today and disappear tomorrow . 
2 ) The second stage : A " breakthrough " of Buffett theory . After a period of intensive study , both in theory and in practice , almost every " wise man " would try to puzzle out a number of questions , such as " What is a Buffett of special Chinese characteristics ? " 
or " Do we have to be flexible in applying the Buffett theory in China ? " 
or " Can we do better than Buffett can ? " 
Thus , during this stage of learning , the student is mainly affected by a blind megalomania in a search for a Buffett theory with a China bent . 
After a period of practice in the real world , success still often proves to be an elusive matter , void of consistency and continuity . If one is lucky , he would do his best to take some losses and reverse his course as early as possible . 
3 ) The third stage : Returning to Buffett . After turning things upside down a number of times , one finally realizes that one is only an ordinary person instead of a genius . 
One should lower expectations of oneself . Modestly , one should be satisfied completely with just learning from Buffett . 
Contrary to common belief , the simplest is the most useful and most effective . But simple methods usually are based on extremely profound theories . Understanding such profound theories must precede better and full prosecution of the simple methods . 
What this stage brings forward is : modest success in the short term , but plenty of long - term rewards and continuity . 
4 ) The fourth stage : " stubborn " Buffett . After tasting continuity of successes , one becomes basically a stubborn hard - line believer in Buffett theories . One would not honor a company that is not of the Buffett mould even with a condescending glance . 
One studies Buffett theories incessantly to enhance one 's understanding and apply them in practice . One 's performance in this stage would bring ever better results , and usher one into a cycle of positives . 
How long each stage lasts would depend on the nature and condition of the individual and his or her luck and fortune . 
Single - Minded Worship of Buddha ( 236553903 ) 14:18:05 
He is my online friend of long standing . He posted the following story in the newsgroup . 
I would rather write the story in this column . 
I hope you all can read the article , though I do not expect it to become a so - called recommended article . Nevertheless , I believe some things and truths can often be better grasped by way of a small but tightly organized story . 
This is a story that makes the readers feel as if a chill is running through the heart . 
I really wish that it were only a story , for such a real - world event would make one feel very sad and distressed . 
On a highway running through mountainous terrain , three gun - wielding bandits , having spotted a pretty woman driver on a medium - sized bus , forced the vehicle to a stop , and invited the driver off the bus for a little stroll . In despair , she called out for help . But all the passengers responded with utter silence . 
The only prompt response came from a middle - aged man of flimsy build . He was , however , knocked down to the floor , wounded . 
Trembling in anger , he tried hard , rose again and shouted for help from all the fellow passengers . However , none responded . That allowed the bandits to drag the woman driver away to the bushes in the forest . 
An hour later , the three bandits came back to the bus along with the driver , whose clothing was badly rumbled and torn . 
The bus was to be under way again . The woman driver asked the skinny and bleeding man who was beaten up to get off the bus . 
He refused and things got into a deadlock . 
Hey , get off the bus . My bus will not carry you . 
The middle - aged man fumed : You are out of your senses . Did I do something wrong in trying to help you ? 
You ? Trying to help me ? 
What help have you given ? 
The woman driver 's persistent denials caused some of the fellow passengers to giggle , quite inaudibly . 
The middle - aged man was furious . He hated himself for not possessing the prowess of a Robin Hood . 
Even if I failed to save people out of dangerous straits , do I deserve to be shooed out of the bus ? He firmly refused to evacuate . 
Besides , I paid the fare and have the right to ride in the bus ! 
The driver raised her sight , looking skyward , and said without mercy : If you do not get off , I am not going to drive . 
Quite unexpectedly , the fellow passengers who closed their eyes when witnessing the brutal crime just a while earlier , were now suddenly awakened . They tried as one to persuade the middle - aged man to leave the bus . Get off real quick . We still have our business to do , and cannot afford the delay ! 
Several strong passengers even wanted to pull the middle - aged man off the bus . That reminds one of scenes in " Boule De Suif " by Maupassant . 
The three bandits grinned smugly . 
Of the three , a dark - skinned one shamelessly said : We made her reckless ! 
The other two also were delirious : she is mine , she is none of your business ! 
A fight and pushing followed until the skinny man 's baggage was thrown out of the window and he himself was shoved out of the vehicle . 
The bus was again under way on the highway in the mountains . The female driver pushed back her hair and turned the radio - recorder on . 
The bus was approaching the summit . After negotiating a turn , the driver saw the slope downward looming large ahead . On the left was mountain side , to the right was a steep cliff hundreds of meters deep . 
Quietly and imperceptibly , the vehicle picked up speed . Facial expression of the woman driver was perfectly calm . Her two hands gripped the steering wheel firmly . Gleaming tears were streaming down her cheeks . 
One bandit seemed to have sensed something wrong . He said , drive slowly ! Slow down ! God damn it ! What are you trying to do ? 
The woman driver said nothing . The bus continued to go faster and faster . 
The bandit tried to dash forward to grab the steering wheel . But the bus was shooting off the cliff like an arrow released from the bow . 
On the next day , local newspapers reported a tragedy that happened yesterday in the Mount Fuhu area : a medium - sized bus plunged down the high cliffs . 
Of all 14 persons on board - - the driver and 13 passengers - - none survived the accident . 
Upon reading the report , the middle - aged man who was forced out of the bus mid - way in the journey , cried out . 
Nobody knew for what and why was he crying . 
Darkness in Railway Station 
I have been traveling by train out of town in the recent days and have discovered how " black " the railroad stations in various places are ! 
I want to find out what precautions one should take in rail stations in various localities . 
I 'm from Changsha , and let me start with a description of the ins and outs of Changsha . Pay attention if you 're going to Changsha ! 
1 . Train tickets always in short supply : Especially in the long holidays , and on dates associated with the start and end of summer and winter vacations or opening and closure of school semesters , the scarcity is absolute . No matter how early you go to line up at the ticket counter , your efforts and sacrifices would prove to be in vain . 
The most water - tight answer I can find is : all tickets have been reserved for and by travel agencies . 
But , from the ticket scalpers , you can get as many as you want at a premium . 
2 . Watch out for forgeries : Even the supply by the scalpers is not always the genuine article . In Hunan , a man becomes rich by forging official certificates and licenses in Shuangfeng , and another fellow by counterfeiting banknotes and coins in Xinhua . Hence , producing forged tickets is merely child 's play . 
Forgery by way of cutting and patching up is of the crudest sort . Some forged tickets look so authentic and even the train staff cannot identify them ! 
3 . Who touched my banknote : Be very careful when shopping at the stores in the rail station . 
If you wish to make a payment in small - change banknotes , ah , ah , you always find their corners torn off . Consequently , you are more or less forced to convert them into notes of large denominations . 
But , when you pay with a big note , the store proprietor would definitely say that he does not have enough change for you . Giving " your " note back , he , then , still asks for small notes of torn corners . Then , you have no alternative but take back the counterfeit note of a large denomination . 
4 . Black magician and small change : Not every store owner gives back " your " note which he has substituted with a counterfeit . That is a serious felony involving relatively greater risks . 
Hence some " timid " store owners can only play the role of the black magician . You clearly see him counting out the correct change . But when you have a chance to do the counting yourself , ah , ah , you would find that a few notes are missing . 
5 . The place is awash with imported wine and liquor . In the tearoom of the railroad station , they do not seem to be in excessive quantity . But you 'll find out soon enough when you walk in . 
A couple glasses of inferior red wine can be sold at prices rivaling that of Martell cognac . If you refuse to pay , you may leave the place and find that your mother no longer recognizes who you are . 
6 . Roses and fire arms : In the vicinity of the rail station , there are numerous video parlors which screen programs whose titles still have enormous attraction over us , the vulgar male viewers . If you step in to take a look , you will surely be taken as an honor guest seeking rest and recreation . Consequently , a rose MM appears in an instant to keep you company . Naturally , prices are comparable with that of 5 - star hotels . Otherwise , you will see that swords are not always used on the enemy ! 
7 . Ice and fire : If you have a Changsha accent or know the city well , you will never be able to get a taxi in front of the rail station . The facial expressions of the taxi drivers will acquaint you with what is called " frost in June . " 
But , if you are a first - time visitor in Changsha , congratulations to you . Even if the place you want to go to is only five minutes away on foot , the driver will be extra warm and solicitous in showing you the pre - eminent sceneries of this nationally designated tourism city , and to offer you , in " second - hand " fashion , a puff of the famous White Sand brand cigarettes or the characteristic local smell of betel - nuts . 
Of course , you 'd have to pay the taxi out of your own pocket . Wouldn 't you ? 
Nanjing Underground Train Driver Should Receive Psycho Treatment Soonest 
Key term : Psychotherapeutic readjustment 
According to Xinhua News Agency , a man lying on the tracks of the Nanjing underground was killed in the evening of July 3 . 
The reporter said : " Zhu Zhengting , 22 years old , a young underground train driver , lived through a nightmare . When your reporter met him yesterday , Zhu did not seem to have regained his composure after being wrecked by the horrifying experience . Sitting on a chair , he stared straight forward , betraying signs of dementia . 
Obviously , the young driver was psychologically devastated and in urgent need of immediate psychotherapeutic treatment . Without such treatment , he could expect permanent damage and life - long suffering . 
I don 't know if all could remember that more than 10 years ago , a man rescued a little girl from an abandoned oil well in Texas , USA . He underwent psychotherapy for a long period of time . But still he finally chose suicide to end his life of miseries . 
At the time , he was given simple psychotherapeutic treatment . But since attention was mostly on the rescued little girl , the very person who needed even more psychotherapeutic attention was neglected . Finally , tragic consequences became inevitable . 
Similarly , in a smuggling case across the Strait of Dover several years ago , the first British policeman to open the suspect container , was reported to have blacked out right on the scene . 
Later , British authorities gave him psychotherapeutic treatment for more than two months before he regained normal psychological equilibrium . 
Draconian trauma caused by disasters often leaves behind severe psychological damage which can not be repaired by the individual victim alone . Such damage often would leave behind a psychological scar . 
Such scars are hardly ever discernible to an outsider . And , even if discovered and identified , they often defy remedies and therapeutic treatment . Hence , many such victims are left in life - long misery and suffering . 
However , in our country people show little care and concern over the suffering and victims of psychological trauma . This is especially true when we talk about family members and / or bosses and superior officers of the victims . They often let the most crucial moments and the most opportune period for rehabilitation slip away . Then , they suddenly think about the matter only when it has become too late . 
Now , since public media have diversified , we often hear a lot of such sensational reports as : many young and / or adolescent girls are abused and injured and many children witness their parents subjected to inhuman cruelty . 
After these children and teenagers are rescued , it is rarely reported that they have been given psychotherapeutic treatment . Most of them are consoled by their relatives . 
Even if the victims now feel safe , their wounds eventually become scars of unrelieved pain and horror that are awakened frequently to haunt them and poison their life and behavior all the time . 
Fortunately , his superiors gave the underground train driver timely help and consolation on the spot to effectively relieve and ameliorate his pressure and strains . 
After all , the driver was neither at fault nor responsible at al for the accident . He also took all needed emergency measures after discovering the dangers . Although he could not and did not forestall the tragic accident , he did all that could have been done . 
I believe , even if another eye - witness , instead of this driver , were present at the scene , he or she , likewise , would have been rudely shocked by the accident . 
But other people are not involved in or responsible for the behavior of the man committing suicide . Even if they were shocked and frightened , the shock will be gradually forgotten with the passage of time . 
The driver , as someone directly involved , could not have things so easy . He consciously and subconsciously commits the horror scene to memory , possibly for the rest of his life . 
If he could be released from memories of this tragedy , that is lucky riddance of the hurtful images . If not , horror will keep on haunting him forever . 
The modern concept of good health embraces all aspects of a person 's well being . Mental health is beginning to get more attention . 
It is regrettable that mental conditions of mankind in general are deplorable , particularly in urban areas . Mental health of the human population is far from ideal . The majority more or less has been threatened by potential mental disorders . And others , already confronted with psycho problems , cannot stir up sufficient sympathy and concern in the mind of the public . 
Just think of the lessons learned in the " Yang Lijuan incident " a while back . Some irresponsible media , in order to arouse public interest and attention , made a target and a sacrificial lamb of a mental patient in deep psychological strain and misery . That exerts very bad influence on the society . 
We must try to prevent this sort of incident from rearing its head . Otherwise , our society will become a sick society . 
Emerging from First Round of New Curricula Training Five Dongkou Fifth High Teachers Have Much to Say 
Key terms : Dongkou Fifth High School , first group of teacher - trainees , training course for new curricula . As members of the first group taking the training course for the new curricula , five Dongkou Fifth High School teachers made a lot of comments . From morning hours of July 13 to July 15 , the first group of five Dongkou Fifth High teachers to take the training courses on the new curricula , felt the palpable pressures and driving force of the curricula . 
Meanwhile , they also thought that new curricula reforms constitute a rare opportunity in and a challenge to the development of pedagogic work in schools . 
In the morning of the 13th , several teachers of the Dongkou Fifth High and teachers from Suining and other places were underway . But delayed by traffic jams caused by road - building work in the Shijiang - Longhui section of the highway , we arrived at the Municipal Education Bureau late , in fact , long after 1:00 p.m. The Bureau 's staff members kept working way beyond the end of the day 's shift , retrieved the materials they already loaded in a truck , did all needed paper work and distributed training materials to us . 
At 2:30 p.m. the road - weary teachers again braved scorching heat to move on to the Municipal First , Municipal Second and Municipal Sixth High Schools to take part in multi - media seminars conducted by experts in various fields . 
In the following two days , the teachers heard lectures either by authors and compilers of teaching materials , or by teachers from other provinces where new curricula reforms have been put into practice . The latter group talked about their new experience and discoveries . Some teachers and researchers of our province who went through similar training courses also shared their knowledge with us . 
After all training courses were concluded in the morning of the 15th , tests and evaluation were also conducted . The five teachers from the Dongkou Fifth High passed these tests without a hitch and received end - of - course certificates . For they all studied earnestly and never were too late in arriving or too early in quitting individual training sessions . 
In the period of the training sessions , teachers from the Dongkou Fifth High exchanged views among themselves . Not familiar with the new curricula in the beginning , all of them felt that assignments were burdensome and pressures , heavy . They were not sure of themselves . 
But after the training sessions were over , all pronounced the whole episode a worthy opportunity and challenge . 
And all pledged their best effort to restructure the educational and knowledge system and to push forward the curricula reformation program to a satisfactory conclusion . 
The second group of teacher - trainees to join the new curricula training program have already arrived in the relevant destinations on the 16th to take up the training courses . 
Dongkou Fifth High Holds Conference on New Curricula Training to Arrange for Participation in Courses at City Education Bureau 
Key terms : Dongkou Fifth High holds conference on new curricula training , Arrange 
The Dongkou Fifth High held a conference on new curricula training to arrange for participation in curricula reform training courses at the Municipal Education Bureau . At noon , 12:00 , on July 5 , a teachers ' conference was held in the principal 's office to discuss participation in the new curricula training sessions in the summer . 
Principal Xie conveyed to all present the ideas and ideals of the new curricula training conference convened by the county ( xian ) authorities that he attended . He also talked on the significance of the new curricula reform . Additionally , he made arrangements in regard to the participants , the time - frame , fees and expenses , as well as other pertinent matters in connection with the training sessions . 
It is reported that the principal , the assistant principal and the teacher assigned to the first high school grade in the coming semester attended the training session held by Shaoyang City authorities to prepare for the new curricula reform . 
Financing came from the superiors . It was said the New China Book Store actually provided the money . 
The principal and the assistant principal took part early in the general training courses . They were followed by the teacher who took various subjects in three periods . Reporting in on July 13 in the morning at the first floor auditorium of the Municipal Education Bureau , he joined the first training period ( its courses included chemistry , history and biology ) . Presenting his identification card , he received money as allowance for his expenses . 
Subsequent training sessions started at around 8:00 in the morning and 2:30 in the afternoon . 
By the end of the forenoon on the 15th , actual time spent in training sessions came to two full days .

History classes were held in the First Municipal High of Shaoyang City . 
After coming back , the teacher - trainees were granted 60 RMB by the school to cover tuition and transportation expenses . But other travel expenditures were not reimbursed . 
Glad to Befriend Fans of stars xxx 
Key terms : fans of the stars 
I have a female friend whom I never met face - to - face . 
I told her directly : I admire you very much . 
For you express your love very directly 
She likes a popular male host on an entertainment show in Taiwan and never tries to cover it up at all . 
When this male host went to Jinan to host a popular program , she flew to Jinan ; when he went to Changsha as a guest performer she winged there . 
In a book he wrote , the male host said a friend sent him a slingshot sans missiles as a gift . She was surprised and told me that this slingshot was a gift " I presented to him . " 
She also joined a team to put out an electronic magazine centered around this star . Joined by me , she enjoyed viewing every issue of it in great excitement . 
I always like to make friends with people who frankly admit that they are fans of one star or another . 
The stars could be a television celebrity , a popular ball player , or , of course , towering figures in other fields . 
I never consider these friends shallow . I think they are lovable . 
Generally , they are honest and straightforward . If they like a person , they say so outright . If they dislike one , they also admit it . 
Dealing with this type of people put you at ease . 
Although they might not take your feelings one hundred percent into consideration . But at least you know well what and how they feel , be it joy , anger , sadness or merriment . You enjoy a sense of greater security when dealing with them . 
These people are very frank and honest . 
You should realize that dare to express one 's likes and dislikes also takes courage . 
Because of a lack of such courage , many people like another person all through their life but remain silent about it . They might even look down on those who openly announce that they are fans of so and so . 
I think , being frank is one of the most admired virtues of a person - - frank to one 's friends and frank to oneself . 
But to be truly frank is , in fact , very difficult . 
If one is able to like a star , at least it proves that one has a unselfish streak in the heart . 
Some of my friends are fans of one star or another . 
To set eyes on this very star , they do not mind suffer inconveniences , miseries and even a great sacrifice . They could go without meals or live a thrift life . They could also hold big posters with the left hand , manipulate a camera in the right hand and , at the same time , shouting at the top of their voice . 
You may call them foolish or childish , but they need to be selfless so that they can love without expecting any compensation , 
Since in the real world too many people love only themselves , always consider themselves to be in the right and never say a good word for another person , this selflessness appears all the more rare and precious . 
Therefore , when people get together to discuss which stars are their idol , and one of the people present would say that " I worship nobody , " 
then , ha , ha , better be careful and on your guard . 
About Zhang Xiaohui 
Key term : Zhang Xiaohui 
By chance I saw one show of the serial , " Emperor Kangxi Comes , " which I have not been watching for a long time . Its leading star is Zhang Xiaohui . 
I think it was around the time when " Peach Color " was being promoted . 
I saw " Peach Color " when I was crazy about films of passion . 
At that time , I really felt it odd that films of lust could be so aesthetic , and sometimes also quite interesting . It is called films of passion . 
Actually I have not seen too many of these films , but those I did see were filmed in quite a number of countries . 
My earliest contacts were with films from Korea and Japan ; 
then , also many from third - world countries , and Latin American and European countries . But , on the other hand , I have not seen too many from Hollywood or from France . 
Of them , two films were so worthy that I could not afford to delete . One was " Adolescence " and the other " Peach Color . " 
The first half of " Peach Color " was quite good . All hands were new and all worked hard . The director also knew how far to go and when to stop . 
The second half was , however , somewhat abnormal . I could not accept it at all . 
In fact , what I want to say is : Zhang Xiaohui said on the program that her boy friends came from nearly all countries of the world except countries in Africa . 
At the time , she had four boy friends . 
This is something , I am afraid , people generally cannot accept . They would say that this person is too licentious . 
But the key of the issue is : she was perfectly sincere and honest when uttering these words , leaving not an iota of bad taste or awkwardness in the listener . 
She also talked about her own view and position on love . 
For example : the other party must be financially independent . 
I guess , she meant , independent also in personality and be able to control one 's own destiny . 
For I know that a person in love sees love as something on the move and something selfish . How can one permit the person one loves accept love from anybody else ! 
According to my experience , knowledge and forecast , Zhang Xiaohui is not experiencing simple emotional attachment , but , decidedly , typical affections between an elder sister and a younger brother . 
In elder sister - kid brother love , the sister can be extremely tolerant and broad - minded . For example , the sister has several brothers all at the same time . Meanwhile , the brother can love the sister insatiably because of her attraction and her motherliness , and do not mind such things as exclusiveness . 
On the other hand , I also find in the remarks of Zhang Xiaohui that she , in fact , understands well how to enjoy life . 
For instance , she loves travel to a fault . 
Hence , I also have a reason to believe that her life is excellent and wonderful . 
But before I am really so convinced , I might not be able to accept these things and happenings . 
Just examine my case . I have also accepted many people , without , in fact , being prejudiced by broad - mindedness or narrow - mindedness . Once you see through the mist and fog , you know that love and hate are anything but absolute . 
These people could be Passer - by A , Friend B , Miss Zhang Ziyi , Good Friend C , or Sister Hibiscus . 
Looking at the life of others , you are no more than an onlooker . To an onlooker , aren 't you the master of your own life ? 
This is like the situation that legends about myself have always been found in the Jiangnan region , even if I have not been there myself . 
Men Need Spirit of Fun 
Key term : spirit of fun 
For a man , life is very hard and burdensome . Hence , he needs to have some fun . 
You either laugh at yourself , watch others making a fool of themselves , or gossip about other people . 
For example , you should go to " the end of the world ( Tianya ) , " to take a look at the " Gossip for Fun " for a bit of relaxation . 
In it , everybody has his say . Naturally , as different shades of blackness in gossips are mongered endlessly , you should be able to distinguish truth from falsehood and the right from the wrong . 
Speak out whenever you wish . And you end up not knowing what you are talking about . But , you have to understand what are you seeing and reading . 
Little S calls Cai Kang an intellectual , or one of the " people who read books . " 
If I can also be counted in this group , then I belong to those people who read a few books , but do not fully understand what they have read . 
Luckily , I always know myself . 
But , after all , I got what I wished to get when I read those few books . 
And coincidentally , I like to think and let my thoughts run wild . I read when I think at the same time . This enables me to see the meaning of things clearly all of a sudden . 
Consequently , some good habits and attitudes are formed . For instance , I often tell myself to be more strict and demanding on my self , but be kind to others . 
Whenever problems or difficulties arise , first look inward for the cause and put the blame on myself . 
Handle the business side rationally , but handle emotions , friendship and feelings with empathy . 
Behave and deal with fellow men in a low key . Execute businesses also in a low key . 
But you know , people are not that good and usually tend to be selfish and calculating in matters of gain and loss . Oftentimes they are hopelessly emotional and sentimental just when the need of the hour is rationality . And when they should use their heart and feelings , they often become God - damned rational . 
But , the good thing about it is : one would not think of regretting the choices one makes . 
When it is done , it is done . When you fall on your face , resign yourself to the mishap . 
Why should you chew the nonsense over and again in your mind ? 
Not too bad , I am not a dour fellow who always try to show myself as a superior intellectual . I am just an ordinary and unrefined commoner . 
Only a difference between me and some of my fellow men lies in the fact that I need not act as a cynic or a misanthrope . I treat everything and all situations rationally . 
And , perhaps , another example of the difference lies in my strong faith and profound convictions . 
Once I trust a person , then , I believe everything he or she does is good . 
Even if there are inadequacies in him or in her , I would be willing and glad to accept and tolerate them . 
Even if I am not of the type that is chummy with friends who frequently get together in a lively and rousing way , I can be classified as one who always has his friends ' interest on his mind . 
But , as this is the case , I guard myself rather carefully against bad company . 
Also , I could not understand at all why there are still so many people who believe what is said and acted upon in the newspapers . 
Perhaps , in their mind news reports of today still have that quality of sacredness as they had in the olden days . 
However , in this world , there are so many things that I cannot understand . 
It 's a joke ! 
I slap myself on the face . 
Song Dandan " Depth of Happiness , " Warm and Touching 
Key terms : Song Dandan , Depth of happiness 
Sometime ago , I read a newspaper report about a newly published book by Song Dandan entitled " Depth of Happiness . " 
I was quite keen on reading it . 
For I wish to know what views she - - as a woman of her age and profession , and having gone through unusual changes in family and career life - - has on herself and on life itself . 
As expected , the book did not disappoint me at all . Going over it I was struck by two things . First , the book thrilled and electrified me . In the life of other people , I saw also my own shadow and image . Secondly , I was deeply touched by detailed descriptions of affectionate life of the family . 
Why was I electrified ? 
In the book Song Dandan wrote : " I neglected an important principle of life : To give is more fortunate than to receive . 
I have always been busy giving , busy in making myself fortunate . 
I don 't want to receive and understand little of receiving . I neglect giving others the opportunity to give , that is neglecting the rights of others to be fortunate . 
I discovered that I myself also have enjoyed such good fortune all the time . From here on , perhaps I should be more thoughtful in this regard . 
If one can face his / her own past with openness and honesty , and bare all and everything before the public , that would have called for considerable courage . 
In her book she wrote about , among other things , her first love , her collapsed marriage with Yingda , penetrating analysis of herself as well as the affections between herself and her son 
There is another matter related to this book which is worthy of praise . In the beginning , the publisher must have strongly urged her to lay greater emphasis on " I Love My Sweet Home , " and " Lay Ambush in Ten Directions " as well as a series of short essays on Zhao Benshan . 
But , I think she must have held firm to her principles . Only casual mention of Zhao Benshan appeared at the end . As to " Ambush " and " I Love My Home , " both were hardly touched on . 
Throughout the entire book , the reader finds brimful of descriptions of how a 40 - year - old woman understands and feels about her own life , love , family and kinship affections . It is warm and touching . 
Busy Vacation 
Key terms : vacation , busy 
Vacation started a week ago . But since then , there has not been one idle moment either . 
I took part in a conference at the academy . Then , I also must gather needed materials for a meeting next week , including drafting a paper to be delivered on that occasion . 
I will be very busy in this vacation . 
Provided that nothing goes out of control , my plans call for the attendance of three conferences and visits to four or five cities . 
Life is fully packed with much content . Some items are similar to each other , others are of various types . I almost forgot how vacations in past years were spent . 
My memories seem to indicate that earlier vacations also were not all spent in idleness . 
Only , in earlier vacations I was in control over the use of long periods of free time . But this year such time has been much curtailed . 
Is it a good or a bad thing ? 
Busy times generally make for a fuller life . But getting busy for nothing or only for a meager harvest , imposes a discount on the value of the packed work schedules . 
However , it seems that there are times when life cannot be evaluated entirely on the criteria of effect produced . Life is to be slowly experienced . To walk on solid ground , to ensure safety and stability in life , and to live fully and pleasantly constitute one sort of worthy accomplishment , even though they cannot be expressed on a scale of social benefits . 
The worth of every individual is assessed on a scale of social value and on a scale of personal value . If one is to be assessed only on one but not on both scales , what should we do ? 
Marxism tells us that the scale of social value should be the top choice , for Marxism advocates contributions by the individual to the society . In reality , however , a healthy and sound society also should fully respect the wishes and values of the individual , and should even create favorable conditions for the realization of personal values . 
This question suddenly caught my interest and attention . More and more clearly I found that Marxist principles really are effective . 
These principles are indeed valid . But in real life , people sometimes cannot help getting confused . 
Even if realization of personal values does not infringe on the realization of social values , would every individual in the real world be satisfied with the realization of himself ? And would he ignore or even set social values aside ? 
Or , can the satisfaction of realizing one 's personal values be divorced from social values assessment ? 
That is very difficult , it seems . 
Consequently , after working hard to live a good ordinary life , every one of us cannot help pursuing excellence and the extraordinary . Failing that , we would blame ourselves for wasting our life . 
Probably , this is one facet of the social man . 
Now the vacation has begun , the days do become more or less relaxed . 
At least , I have time to watch an occasional video show , or relax and play a while , 
and chat a little . There 's still work to be done , and a life to live . 
Next week , I have to go away again , to a conference in Xi - an . 
Although I have never visited Xi - an , the city is not much to my liking , because of some prejudices I have picked up . 
I hope this forthcoming trip could change my impressions of this city . Ho , Ho ! 
" Highly Feministic Life " 
Key terms : men , feminism era 
In the afternoon Ying phoned . We talked for a while and brought up me watching " Pleasant Male Voice . " 
Ying said : " It couldn 't be true ! You are too cute ! Super Female Voice followed by Pleasant Male Voice , you are a real loyal audience of the Hunan Satellite Television . " 
I admitted that she was right . 
Ying said she watched some talent hunt programs featuring male performers . She considers them bunch of feminine males . I agree with her , but told her that " Pleasant Male Voice " has reached a 5 - rising-to-4 rating and would score 4 - rising-to-3 next week . The vocals were really good . Every one tumbled over the other in their climb to the summit . 
Ying , a student of popular and consumer subcultures , also became excited and said she would watch that program next week . After all , when competition is reaching its most crucial final climax , the show will become most spectacular . Taking a look at it could very well help a researcher collect materials on interesting cases essential for future research projects . 
Then , our conversation turned to the topic : arrival of the age of male sexual appeal . 
Men finally changed their status from the " observer " to the " observed . " Women , who played the role of " guest " in the past , have now become the " master , " who can , as spectators , face down and enjoy various types of shows of the age of male sexual appeal which feature a cast of male stars . 
Ying said , that is liberation of women , and a signpost of feminism . 
Then , she added : " Don 't you think you are leading a highly feministic life ? " 
Upon hearing Ying 's remarks , I burst out into loud laughter of joy . 
These words are 100 percent feministic in themselves . But , it takes somebody better than I , somebody like Ying , who has such superior faculties of deliberation and discrimination , to explain and illuminate these things clearly and in great depth . 
In " Pleasant Male Voice " I like very much the songs of Chen Chusheng which are of excellent quality capable of penetrating time and space in the direction of your heart . Very pure , clean and comforting . 
Songs by Su Xing are varied in form and presented with a great deal of feeling . His looks are elegant and graceful . Meanwhile , he carries himself vivaciously and lightheartedly . 
Zhang Jie 's songs are extremely powerful and resonant . Particularly , the two songs , " Your Looks " and " Yesterday Is Blown Away , " on today 's program are my old favorites impressively presented . 
Wei Chen who closely resembles Lu Yi , has a lovely face pure and clear . He is believed to be very popular among young girls . Naturally , his voice is quite presentable . 
With four top stars of this stature racing further upward to the summit , the show should be tremendously worth watching . 
We are looking forward to watching their sensational shows next week ! 
Topsy - turvy " Pickled Cabbage Mood " on June 29 
Key terms : pickled cabbage , Seoul 
Topsy - turvy " Pickled Cabbage Mood " on June 29 . I have international roaming , but , upon getting off the plane , I found it was like the power was cut on my cell phone . Not even one line of signals was shown . Perhaps for Quanqiutong , its coverage meant the influence sphere of the heart . And the coverage would take effect on the day of your next payment . 
For the coming days , I would temporarily lose contact with you all . ha , ha , will anybody worry about me because of this ? 
I opened the " secretary " in order to ascertain who was thinking of me , 
no matter the thoughts were of business or of private life . 
But , the question was : " Who do I wish would be thinking of me ? " 
My heart has turned blank and empty . And I don 't know the time this began to happen . 
I do not understand why some people would go away even if you want to keep them , while others believe they can elbow their way in despite your wish to get rid of them . Does it not sound and feel like a scene in the marketplace ? 
But , the heart . Can you fill the heart with the " white glove " type of substitutes even if you are not allocated any room in that heart ? 
After all , material things and the heart just cannot be discussed on the same terms ! 
Our car runs on the high speed freeway leading to Pusan . 
The Minister does not say a word when he is driving . Neither do I have anything to say . 
After all , he understands neither Chinese nor English . And I can only say a few , a few sentences in Pidgin English . 
I am bored watching the computer screen and working the keyboard . Inside the car , only the clicking on the keyboard and the pleasant voice of young Korean ladies from the GPRS navigation system . All is deadly quiet . 
Outside the car window , what is left for you to watch is an endless stretch of green and a grayish sky . 
For me , keeping quiet seems to be out of character . 
Unexpectedly , the only thing that makes me feel at home in this country is the English language . 
The eye - full of circles makes you nothing else but dizzy . 
I think , Korea definitely would not make compasses , 
because there is no demand of compasses in the market . 
Seoul is clean , thoroughly clean , meticulously clean . 
Only , it is too bad that in the few days in Seoul I have had no time to visit any place outside the workplace and department stores . All my impressions are gained through what I see along the roads I travel . 
Luckily , everything is still nice and beautiful . 
The Korean people are strictly observing traditional courtesy , smiling methodically , and listening seriously . They are refined and quiet . 
All that meet the eye are the beautiful surface layer , traditional customs , old style architecture and a national culture that is trembling with fear . 
Is that hypocrisy ? 
Maybe a little hypocrisy is okay . At least all would observe decorum . 
When ugly things are not in sight , people would think that they do not exist . 
Korean food and drinks are very good . 
However , I don 't like and don 't understand why all the changes back and forth involve only the presentation of pickled vegetables in various forms and on different combination platters . It goes without saying , seaweed is an indispensable ingredient of all and every dish . 
Now , let 's look at things from another angle . The Korean people are really tops doing research on food and drinks . They can tell apart the pickled cabbage made and stored on the surface of the earth and that made and stored underground ; and can determine with measured - by - the - minute precision the age of pickled cabbage . 
All these constitute circumstantial evidences that the Korean national character of meticulousness has something to do with their use of pickled cabbage from early morning to late evening . 
But , I am worried . As the Minister is about taking us to that Japanese tofu restaurant , I wonder how will its cook combine pickled vegetables with his specialties . 
Recalling the Chinese food we had last night , I feel like crying . It is completely " Koreanized " and the only thing that could pass muster was pickled cabbage . 
Ah huh , thanks to the China Southern Airline for the pickled cabbage it offered on the in - flight menu . 
The airline must have presumed that I wish to accustom myself to the Korean delicacy right from the time I board the Korea - bound aircraft . 
There are two more days to go before I return home . In case I still have nobody on my mind , I 'd do well thinking of our maid who serves a dish of good Chinese pork stew . 
After all , to fill one 's stomach is more direct and immediate fulfillment than to satisfy the needs of the heart . 
Naturally , this point has nothing to do with pickled cabbage . 
Two Trees 
There are two trees . One is me ; one is my brother - in - law . 
We provide each other shade , and help and care for each other . 
In my generation , families bring up many sons and daughters . But I have no brothers , only sisters - - elder and younger sisters . Therefore , it apparently appears to be a very important occasion when a brother - in - law arrives . 
We were children from poor families who had to do the countless household chores ever since very young ages . I tried hard to put up a grown - up fa ? ade and to perform like a skillful old hand , but , what I did never could win a nod of approval from my Dad . 
Ever since early childhood , I have been bothered by the symptoms of sleepwalking , which were not very serious . But , while doing house work , the wondering mind inevitably pop up , now and then . 
Once Dad wanted me to apply some plaster on the chimney of our old house . I hurried up to the top of the roof to do the job . 
The plastering job was done . But when it rained , the roof sprang a leak because I stepped on a few tiles and broke them . 
Another instance began as Dad asked me to replace a light bulb , an old - fashioned unfrosted light bulb . 
After I climbed up a stool , the new bulb slipped out of my hand dropped down to the cement floor and was smashed . 
I lost count of such little incidents . Consequent to the numerous blunders I committed , my brother - in - law , soon after being welcomed to the house , took over house chores , all and sundry , as a matter of course . And , he did them with flying colors at hardly any labor cost . 
As to me , it meant happy times to hide myself in a corner of the house to enjoy " xian shu , " ( books for killing time ) which looks and feels like bricks . 
Later on , we grew into two big trees that are strong enough to support the building that was our family . 
But , my father , on the other hand , inevitably saw his stature began and kept on shrinking . Finally , Dad in the wheel chair became a thick growth of shrubs that stays quiet and unnoticed in the deep shade . 
Unexpectedly , fate , like the weather , suddenly altered its course . The 50 - year - old brother - in - law , all of a sudden , was afflicted with a serious disease . Still looking luxuriant , this huge tree , however , was drawing incredibly close to its horrible end , death . 
On a dazzling summer day , outside the operating room of the Beijing Union Hospital , the surgeon casually said : The case is not worth operating . 
He has , at the most , two more months to live . 
Right at this instant , I was dumfound , feeling like being struck by a stray bullet that separated my soul from the body . 
Again , somnambulism began to rear its head . I saw the courtyard of our old house and my young brother - in - law busily moving about there . 
Then , awakened by a shrilling cry from my elder sister , I hurried to the hallway in the hospital where she fell down and sat on the ground . I helped her up and embraced her while tears streamed down our cheeks . 
The dazzling sun suddenly disappeared . And the scene just in front of my eyes turned black in fits and starts . 
After coming back to our hometown , my brother - in - law soon found out the true condition of his illness . Holding my sister in his arms , he joined her in a good and unrestrained cry . After that , he unexpectedly regained his calm and freedom from anxieties . 
My brother - in - law began methodically to make arrangements for the family for the time after his departure from this world . For instance , he would tell his son to " take good care of the Grandma on behalf of me . " " After Grandma passes away , bury her remains in your Grandpa 's grave . " And he gave instructions on how to open that grave to prepare for the burial of both grandparents together . 
" Pay frequent visits on your maternal grandfather . Bring him useful and practical gifts on New Year 's and other festival holidays . " 
Also , he told my younger sister " to visit your elder sister often after I am gone . All by herself , she must be very lonely and lonesome . " 
I tried to allocate as much time as possible to visit with him . He was usually embarrassed when we were together face to face . 
We often faced each other silently , as two trees would . Though living , they cannot talk to each other . 
They are two grown - up trees . Wind - swept and rain - soaked , we are past masters of facing the world of trials and tribulations . Was it still necessary for him to tell me anything more ? 
It seemed unnecessary . 
For your heart understands : After you are gone , my sister , and the children you two brought to this world , in fact , the entire family , will have to lean on me , one of the two trees left standing . 
Who makes the decision that I be born a man ! 
As a man , you must , like it or not , resolutely keep your backbone upright and lift the burdens up on your shoulders . 
The only regret I have is : why did you , the other tree , wither away so early when you should still live a life of abundance and luxuriant growth in your sun - set years that were to come ? 
You departed this world on the New Year 's Day on the lunar calendar . 
That is the festival spring holiday celebrated by Chinese communities all over the world . But , you took your leave , all alone . 
Perhaps , in another world and under a new framework of time and space , is another new life being born ? 
N Minutes in Life 
The reason that I came up with such a seemingly fashionable title is that the befuddled brain had no time to trifle with counting the minutes when the world was plunging into the depth of utter despair . 
Like an innocent person suddenly receives , out of the blue , a court sentence of capital punishment . Will he try to pick out , in a leisurely manner , the grammatical mistakes in the text of the sentence ? 
On a winter day , it was very cold in the youth hostel . 
Nobody knew who was on duty . Throughout the day , the stove remained unlit . 
Since a strong earthquake was said to be imminent , we did not bother to kindle the stove when we returned to our den early in the evening . 
On the long bunk which could accommodate 12 people , the four of us , bundled in cotton quilts , and shivering all over from severe cold , were playing the poker game " Three to One " under dim light , betting with our meal coupons . 
All of a sudden , a noise which started far away was rolling nearer and nearer . In a split second , we exchanged staring glances and realized that catastrophe was descending on us . 
Consequently , throwing away the cards in our hand , jumping down from the bunk , together we dashed through two narrow doors out of the room . 
At the very blink we cleared the dormitory building , the poor hut of piled - up stone was instantaneously pulverized . 
After dashing into the courtyard , we found the ground swinging under our feet the way a boat does . Like a toy tumbler , the world rocked back and forth unable to find a firm footing . 
In a matter of seconds , buildings all around us , contrary to its old image of solid stability , creaked , whined , performed the mad dance number , " Thunderclap , " and finally turned themselves into a spiral of smoke and floating dust in an act of suicide . 
The power - lines above our head , naturally , would like to join the crowd . They snapped with a sharp cracking sound , and , like horse whips , flew wildly in all directions . 
And all around us , the devastating earth tremors were celebrating their novel accomplishment with fireworks . Multi - colored flashes of light emissions from the earth easily beat the special effects of all elaborate blockbuster war movies in beauty and impressiveness . Sounds of the earthquake rolling on in all directions like the beating of battle - field drums severely strained one 's nerves . 
At that juncture , everybody had the same idea on his mind : " The last day for mankind has arrived ! " 
I could imagine that a yawning gap was opening up on the ground under our feet . There in , boiling lava hissed like molten iron to issue a fiery invitation . Innumerable numbers of humans , looking like ants , were dropping down into the lava in a free fall . They disappeared in a split second , without being generous enough to leave behind even a streak of blue smoke . 
My spine became happily numb as if someone had injected ice water in the column . In the darkness , faces of my companions looked like paper masks drifting and floating about unsteadily . 
I asked myself : Is mankind taking leave of this beautiful and interesting world ? Is the civilization of myriads of years to be completely wiped out overnight ? 
But , I am not yet 20 years old . The flower of youth has just started to blossom . The delight of life is barely discovered . Oh , how reluctant I am to say goodbye to this world ! 
Oh , my dad , mom and all my loved ones , where are you ? What are you doing at this moment ? Are you still alive ? 
Faced with the terrifying and gloating smiles of the God of Death , how I yearn over all of you ! 
. . . . I did not know how long this lasted . Finally , the empty - headed me was delighted to discover that the rolling noise transmitted through the ground was gradually diminishing , earth tremors were slowing down and the smoke and spark overhead also stopped blinking . 
The huge ship tumbling in the sky - high waves and frightful storm was finally inching her way into a peaceful harbor . 
Having just weathered a maddening battle , a young and easily breakable heart was finally and carefully returned to its original position . 
Oh my earth ! My home and garden ! Finally , you made us feel again the warmth and care of our home ! 
Born of our survival of a catastrophe , a feeling of joy and good fortune slowly spread out from both heels upward through the entire body 
After regaining his foothold , Yu Doudou who was barely 17 years old , suddenly cried out loud . For he simply could not bear to see the once warm and harmonious youth hostel now reduced to a huge pile of debris and ruins . 
The highly contagious mood was transmitted to all people present . And tears swelled into a torrent . 
Snow began to fall down from the firmament . Was it expressing sadness and mourning for the victimized mankind ? 
That year , earthquake took more than 1,000 lives in Haicheng . 
Some experts say it was extremely fortunate that there were timely forecasts and that the quake took place before most people went to bed . Otherwise , the quake measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale would have taken a toll of at least one hundred thousand lives 
Only one year later , an earthquake shook up Tangshan and killed more than 200,000 people . 
Things Happened in Village 
In the village there are many families . Of them , the family named Nan is the most disliked . A well - known phrase widely circulated in the village says : " Guard against fire , robbers and the Nans . " 
In fact , the whole Nan clan may be counted as relatively honest . 
Ordinarily , some families would swipe something , such as melons , from the field of other people . All that the Nan family does are no worse than pilfering a chicken or stealing a dog . It shouldn 't have come to the point that the whole village shuns and tries to isolate the Nan family . 
No body is clean . Who have we of the Nan clan offended ? 
The Nan family has begun to engage in a number of prideful activities , demonstrating that the village , in its earliest beginning , was founded by ancestors of the Nan clan which has always been a large grain producing household . Moreover , it has produced quite a number of celebrities in history , and , additionally , made important contributions to the development and construction in the village . 
In the meantime , members of the Nan family warmly and anxiously invite cadres of the village to come for visits and to look around . 
All in all , members of the entire Nan clan strive for progress resolutely . They want to take the initiative in a battle and to strive for power and strength . 
Not very long ago , the Xi family did something that was rather mean : - - cruelly persecuting the young sprouts of the Nan family . 
The family named Xi is well known in the whole village through their work of match - making . All young men benefited from such work by the Xi family . 
Without the good match - making service performed by Xi family members , how can you , members of all families , do a good job in production ? 
But in recent days members of the Xi family , to the surprise of other villagers , used black bricks to squeeze out the life of young sprouts brought forth by the Nan family . That action was extremely abominable . The whole village rose in anger and said that the Xi family did not even have one good and decent family member . 
The Nans demanded that the Xi family give them an explanation . That touched off a wave of sympathy and support for the Nans throughout the village . 
One after another , virtually all villagers spit on the members of the Xi family . 
This way , the battlefield is transferred to the Xi family . 
The Nan family made a firm decision to give a good shine to the image of the clan before the opening of the 17th Plenary Conference of the village . They wanted to help the clan , which had more members than other clans in the village , to grow and prosper in the future . 
Although cadres of the village try , day in and day out , to persuade everybody to keep inter - personal relationships harmonious , life in the place that we know as Zhong Village , however , is far from peaceful and tranquil . 
In a short period of two to three months , the most irritating thing that happened is the revolt proclaimed boisterously by the pigs . Even pigs wish to raise themselves in others ' esteem . 
Two years ago , chickens spread bird flu in many villages . Weren 't they all liquidated ? 
Poor pig , don 't you have brains in the head ? 
Don 't you dare to further instigate a revolution ! That will deny you a chance to escape the fate of decapitation . 
In the Village of Mei and in the Village of Ying , two habitual bullies , life has been blessed by wealth and abundance but not necessarily by peace and harmony . 
In the Village of Mei , some vagabonds knock down a couple of skyscrapers today . Tomorrow they throw boxfuls of dynamite on underground rail tracks in the Village of Ying . These are frightening enough , aren 't they ? 
These things have enabled people in the Villages of Shang and Zhong to reach the following conclusion : Though they cannot afford decent housing , sick calls , medical care and opportunities to receive education , they are able to work on farms and in factories and can build up their social network in peace and good conscience . This means these villages have already ushered in the modern age . 
There are the Nan family , the Xi family , and many others . Which one of them can claim to be completely free from difficulties and problems ? 
Take a look at the Wan family in the southeastern part of the village . Though the head of this clan is shameless and dishonorable , our great Village of Zhong , still takes good care of them just the same ? 
The Inter - Village Games of 2008 will be held in our Village of Zhong very soon . Let some of the unworthy problems in the village be cleared away . And let the naughty children of the village be disciplined . 
Let all the families and households light their lamps and kindle their fires . Let the wealthy chip in with their monies and the able - bodied pledge their muscle power . 
When the time comes , let us go to the bird nest to see the gold eggs .

Eric Looks at Google China 
Key words : Eric , Google , Google China . Author : an ordinary Google employee 
I am an employee who joined Google China rather early . In the recent two years we went through a lot of tests . Some of them were expected beforehand , but others , for sure , happened unexpectedly . 
Yesterday , since the corporate earnings report of this quarter , it is learned , would devote a special chapter to reporting developments in China , and , by chance , heard corporate CEO , Eric 's answer to a question about China . The remarks by Eric provided me with a lot of food for thought which I have just located and am sharing with you now . 
These remarks were made in the Google Inc . Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call last week . ( http://investor.google.com/earnings.html ) In answer to a reporter 's question CEO Eric said he was completely satisfied with current accomplishments of Google China and had a full measure of confidence in Google 's future development in the Chinese market . 
Eric said : In China we have excellent talents , constantly upgraded equipment and installations as well as incessantly enriched and localized production lines . 
Predicting no immediate and surefire success just in front of our eyes , Eric , however , said Google China already had a very good start . And , with hard work by the Chinese team , generous support from the headquarters and plenty of perseverance , he was convinced that Google China will certainly achieve astonishing results in the future . 
Yes , it is essential that we march onward and upward resolutely , for we were born and brought up here and we are deeply attached to this place . We firmly believe that Google should give a great deal more to China and to its customers .

Slippers without Strings 
Now , for whatever merchandise , top - less is all the rage , especially in the summer . Everyone wishes to run around in the nude , for any piece of clothing would make the wearer that much hotter . 
You probably learned sometime ago that T - back which was popular for quite a number of years was knocked out by G - String , because the latter has no string at all . 
For the same reason , and in this day , the slippers you are wearing will quite likely become out - dated , because a brand new type , the string - less slipper , has made its appearance . It consists of nothing else but the sole . 
How to wear that without a string ? 
We are not God . Manufacturers also have no magic . 
This kind of slippers is directly glued to the sole : This is not prank , but real merchandise . Its selling price is around US $ 13.5 per pair . 
This is another kind of " I have imagined it could exist , but never dreamed of its real existence " product . It leaves me speechless . 
Manufacturers consider this kind of slippers to be extremely cool . Don 't you believe them ? 
Please take a look . Just glancing at it is enough to make the sole of my feet extremely uncomfortable . [ via F.C ]

Key word : Beautiful woman 
Grand opening of the China Digital Entertainment Expo & Conference ( Chinajoy ) took place on July 12 , with a daily average of 40,000 visitors . 
Large numbers of local enterprises participated in this year 's conference as exhibitors . Most of them are showing web surfing . 
I believe , among the addictive high technologies for mature readers and users , " showgirl " has greater attractive power than internet surfing . 
Don 't be impatient . The entr ¨ ¦ e will be served right away .

Watching Blockbusters without Wide Screen ; Pictures of Cell Phone Projector Revealed 
Key term : cell phone 
The Korean company Iljin Display is introducing a coin - sized laser projector module . 
Due to its extremely small size , the projector module , capable of creating a 7 - in display area on the wall , can be installed inside a cell phone . 
A traditional projector has three different LCD panels to project respectively three different , namely red , green , and blue , video signals . But this tiny projector needs only one LCD panel to switch back and forth among the three colors , thus reduces both the size and the production cost of the projector . 
An official statement said since the LCD panel used in this projector module measures only 0.24 inches , the module can be integrated easily inside a cell phone . 
Now , over half of the cell phones on the market have cameras built in . And it is foreseen that cell phones with built - in projectors will appear on the market very soon . But it is really very difficult to predict if the market will or will not receive this new device with enthusiasm .
