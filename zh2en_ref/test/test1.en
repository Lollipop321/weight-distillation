White House Pushes for Nuclear Inspectors to Be Sent as Soon as Possible to Monitor North Korea 's Closure of Its Nuclear Reactors 
The White House today called for nuclear inspectors to be sent as soon as possible to monitor North Korea 's closure of its nuclear reactors . The White House made this call after US President Bush had telephone conversations with South Korean President Roh Moo - hyun . 
White House National Security Council spokesman Johndroe said that the two leaders today had " discussed new developments concerning the US 's cooperation with South Korea on the North Korea nuclear issue , and looked forward to the speedy return of IAEA inspectors to North Korea to monitor the shutdown and sealing of the North Korean nuclear reactors . " 
Johndroe said that the two presidents also welcomed the US - South Korea free trade agreement that was signed + yesterday , and would work to ensure that the congresses of both countries approve this agreement . 
Experts believe that the elemental plutonium that Pyongyang has produced over the last 20 years is sufficient to create twelve nuclear weapons . 
Hill , the US envoy to the six - party talks , said after a visit to Pyongyang last week that he expected the Yongbyon nuclear reactors would be shut down in the middle of July . 
Torrential Rains Hit Western India , 43 People Dead 
Western India was battered by strong winds and torrential rains over the weekend . Some areas saw serious flooding , and all domestic and overseas flights to and from Mumbai , the major city in the west , were stopped . 
Relief officials said today that in total it had caused the deaths of 43 people . 
From June to September every year , strong winds and heavy rains brought by the monsoon often cause widespread flood disasters and even human casualties in India , a country with a population of 1.1 billion . 
In this disaster caused by torrential rains , half of the victims were carried away and drowned in the floods ; the others died because their houses collapsed or from electrocution caused by short circuits . 
Mumbai , India 's financial center , was also affected . 
Over just two days on the 29th and 30th , rainfall in Mumbai reached 243 mm . 
Mumbai 's chief administrator , Pathak , said that in this city alone , 13 people had died . 
City officials appealed for the 15 million residents to avoid going out before the torrential rains eased so as to protect their own safety . 
Yesterday the rain cleared for a while , but most districts of Mumbai were still completely flooded today . 
Nearly 500 People Dead in Monsoon Floods in India

Just in Maharashtra , the state which includes Mumbai , India 's largest city , the number of people known to have died has now reached 358 . 
Reports say that Kadam made the above statement to media and journalists as he was making an inspection of Mumbai . 
He said that Maharashtra , which is also India 's biggest cotton - producing state , was entirely covered with a vast expanse of water , and there were cities and towns numbering 27 and about 2,000 villages which had been hit by serious flooding . More than 10,000 affected people had been evacuated to safe shelters . 
The whole of India , from south to north , started to progressively enter the monsoon season a week ago . The residents of each state all greeted the heavy rains as relief at the end of a long drought , but didn 't expect that the rain would come with unexpected violence , a real deluge . Highways have become rivers ; houses in low - lying areas have been surbmerged in the water ; the transport system is nearly paralyzed .

Satellite Images Show Iran Digging a Tunnel , Feared to be for Protecting Nuclear Facilities 
The Institute for Science and International Security , a US think tank , today reported that commercial satellite images have shown that Iran is digging a tunnel in a mountain near the Natanz uranium enrichment facility , which may be for protecting nuclear facilities in the event of air strikes . 
The images were taken by US company DigitalGlobe ( DigitalGlobe ) on June 11 and have been posted on the ISIS website . 
The Insitute , located in Washington DC , is a non - profit research organization . 
The images show that road building is going on through the mountains just 2.4 kilometers south of the Natanz facility , and within that facility is a uranium enrichment plant . 
Analysts Albright and Brannan say in a report that the entrance and exit of the tunnel in the images are not clear , but that " one of the roads seems to lead into a tunnel facility . The other road may also lead to a tunnel entrance / exit . " 
They say : " A tunnel facility inside a mountain like this would be of great use in terms of protection during an air strike . " 
UN Envoy Calls Nuclear Talks , Iran 's Attitude Still Inflexible 
UN International Atomic Energy Agency deputy director - general Heinonen today held talks with Iranian officials in Tehran , once again trying to break the deadlock created by Iran 's nuclear plans . 
But Iranian President Ahmadinejad remained defiant under increasing pressure from the UN 's further sanctions . 
Ahmadinejad asserted that Iran will not stop uranium enrichment , but welcomed these new talks . 
He said : " Progress towards the installation of centrifuges can be delayed or speeded up . This is an administrative issue . But no - one should expect us to give up our rights . We will not stop this progress . " 
He made this remark after Heinonen arrived in Tehran . 
Heinonen 's aim on this trip is to establish a plan to resolve " the outstanding issues " caused by Iran 's nuclear plans . 
The UN has already imposed two sets of sanctions on Iran because Tehran failed to freeze its uranium enrichment operation . 
The Islamic Republic News Agency reports that Heinonen held talks with officials led by Vaeedi , deputy secretary of Iran 's Supreme National Security Council for International Affairs . 
The members of Iran 's delegation at the talks also included Saeedi , vice - president of the Atomic Energy Organization , and Soltaniyeh , permanent ambassador to the IAEA . 
State of Emergency Period Ends ; Palestinian Prime Minister Fayyad to Form New Government 
The month - long state of emergency declared by the Palestinian authorities after Hamas militants occupied the Gaza Strip comes to an end today . Prime Minister Fayyad offered resignation temporarily , but was immediately ordered to take responsibility for forming a new government . 
Minister for Agriculture and Social Affairs Habbash told AFP : " Prime Minister Fayyad offered his resignation to President Abbas . The president accepted it and at the same time also asked him to form a new cabinet government to be responsible for routine administration . " 
Amr , an advisor to Abbas , told AFP that Fayyad had tendered his resignation , but that Abbas had ordered him to " act in his current position until he has formed a new government . " 
The resignation of Fayyad , who is a highly respected economist , was merely a procedural resignation , and will not affect his position as prime minister . 
Fayyad has led Palestine 's emergency cabinet since the 17th of last month , being responsible for executing Abbas 's state of emergency decree after Hamas 's violent occupation of Gaza . 
According to the basic law of the Palestinian self - rule government , a state of emergency cannot exceed 30 days without the agreement of the parliament , but the autonomous parliament is currently paralyzed . 
The emergency government 's authority expires today . 
WTO Delegates Propose New Plan , Hoping to Break Deadlock in the Doha Round of Talks 
The main delegates at the World Trade Organization talks today suggested that the US make major cuts in its agricultural subsidies and that developing countries significantly reduce import duties on industrial products in order to break the deadlock in the Doha round of trade talks . 
Officials say the new " draft models " require the US to reduce its annual subsidies for agriculture from the 19 billion US dollars permitted at present to 16.2 billion US dollars , and developing countries to adjust and reduce import duties on industrial products to below 23 % . 
These suggestions are aimed at breaking the deadlock in which the Doha round of talks has been stuck for nearly six years , and at bringing the 150 members of the WTO to a compromise agreement . 
Director - general Lamy of the WTO called these suggestions " a fair and reasonable foundation for reaching an agreement which has major long - term targets and balance and is development - oriented . " 
Lamy said : " The member states will not be completely satisfied with the details of the suggestions , but at present the problems causing differences are fewer than the problems of reaching agreement . " 
He called for intensive talks to be held over the next few weeks .

Worries over Buying Frenzy , Indonesia Cancels Sale of Environmentally - friendly Bags from Well - known British Brand 
A sales agent said today that Indonesia had canceled the sale of environmentally - friendly bags from a well - known British brand in the light of the chaos caused by the buying frenzy earlier this month in Hong Kong . 
The manager of On Pedder , a well - known store located in the high - end Plaza Indonesia , said : " In the light of the events in Hong Kong , we have canceled the sale of environmentally - friendly bags . 
If the public is going to brawl over a 140,000 - rupiah ( about 494 NTD ) bag , then it 's not worth that . " 
Thousands of Hong Kong residents gathered outside the shop selling them on the 6th , ready to scramble for the limited - edition , environmentally - friendly bags , which were designed by British designer Anya Hindmarch and are printed with " I am not a plastic bag . " But the shop staff refused to open the doors , causing the situation to get out of control . 
These top - end products , aimed at protecting the environment , are attempting to replace plastic bags , and unexpectedly became a fashion symbol instantly in London and New York . They have triggered a buying frenzy as the price on auction website eBay has soared to many times the retail price . 
On Pedder , the only authorized vendor in Indonesia , said that it was not sure whether or not it would begin the sale in a few days . 
Hostage Crisis Countdown : South Korea Talks Directly with Taliban 
The Taliban in Afghanistan have kidnapped 23 South Korean hostages and fixed sunset today as the deadline , demanding that South Korea withdraw its troops from Afghanistan or they would kill the hostages . 
As the minutes and seconds go by , there have been positive developments in the situation . South Korean officials held talks with the Taliban for the first time today . 
But at the same time the Taliban said that another German hostage who had been kidnapped was in extremely poor health , and had started to become comatose and to lose consciousness . 
The Taliban called on Germany and South Korea to withdraw their troops from Afghanistan and demanded 33 guerrillas imprisoned by the Afghan government in exchange for these hostages . 
Taliban spokesperson Ahmadi said in a telephone interview by AFP at an undisclosed location : " We have established direct contact with the South Korean delegation through tribal elders . " 
Amadi said : " We hope this meeting will bring results . "

Difficulty in Reaching Agreement in Dispute over Territorial Waters , Military Meeting Between the Two Koreas Breaks up in Discord 
A three - day high - level military meeting between North and South Korea broke up in discord today , because both sides were immovable on the drawing of maritime borders . 
The talks , held in the border city of Panmunjom , entered the final day of negotiation today . North Korea 's chief representative Lieutenant - General Kim Yong - Chol ( transliterated ) said : " We 've come to the conclusion that we don 't need these fruitless talks any more . " 
Red - faced and with an obviously displeased expression , Kim Yong - Chol criticized South Korea for intentionally avoiding discussions on drawing a new maritime border to replace the original " Northern Limit Line . " 
He alleged that the " Northern Limit Line " was not legal . 
The " Northern Limit Line , " located in the Yellow Sea , was set by the American military in 1953 after the end of the Korean war . However , in recent years it has become a focus of dispute between the two Koreas , and North Korea has further refused to recognize it . 
North Korea says that South Korean warships have illegally invaded these waters , causing tension . South Korea calls this accusation groundless . 
Conflict broke out in local waters in June, 1999 , causing the deaths of dozens of North Korean sailors . 
In June 2002 there was again news of a similar conflict . Six South Koreans were unfortunately killed . 
US Treasury Secretary Arrives on Visit to China ; Environmental Protection and Exchange Rates are Focuses of Concern 
US Treasury Secretary Paulson arrived yesterday on a visit to China . The US is currently doing all it can to persuade China to carry out further necessary economic reforms and work on environmental protection . The renminbi exchange rate is an issue that will receive particular attention . 
US diplomats say that Paulson first visited Xining , capital city of China 's large northwestern province of Qinghai . 
China is currently carrying out a series of plans for environmental protection near the largest freshwater lake in Qinghai Province . 
Today Paulson will move on to Beijing to discuss pushing for progress in the US - China Strategic Economic Dialogue started last year and other issues with Chinese chief officials . 
The US - China Strategic Economic Dialogue mainly discusses economic , environmental protection and other issues . Yet , the most important is the issue of the renminbi exchange rate . US congressmen believe that the renminbi is excessively undervalued . 
The trade deficit between the US and China is quickly escalating . Internal pressure within the US is gradually rising , and congressmen are ready to take retributive action to resist what they call China 's unfair trade policies . 
Last week the US Senate Finance Committee overwhelmingly approved a bill requiring the Treasury to identify a list of countries with " fundamentally misaligned " currency exchange rates . This opens the door for potential economic sanctions to be brought against Beijing . 
US congressmen say that the renminbi is undervalued , which makes the price of goods that China sells to the US extremely cheap , and adds to the trade imbalance between the US and China . Last year the US 's trade deficit with China reached 232.5 billion US dollars .

" I have promised my wife that I won 't keep coaching until I 'm 70 like Robson and Ferguson . " 
Mourinho said frankly , " When I 'm 60 , I want to say farewell to soccer completely . 
I have too many things waiting for me to do that I can 't do at the moment . " 
" I don 't want to become a soccer consultant or a technical supervisor , like Valdano or Sacchi . 
I don 't want to play this role . 
I don 't want to be a club chairman . I just want to say farewell to soccer completely , " Mourinho stressed .

F1 " Spy Case " Hearing Finished Yesterday ; McLaren Escapes Penalties for Now 
Last night Beijing time , the special hearing held by the FIA World Motor Sports Council in Paris over the Ferrari engineer spy case came to a close . McLaren , who had been summoned , managed a lucky escape : the council decided not to impose any penalty on McLaren for the time being . 
The FIA official website published a statement after the hearing , saying : " Vodafone McLaren Mercedes was in possession of confidential Ferrari information , but at present there is insufficient evidence to show that this information was used improperly in the FIA Formula One World Championship . Therefore no penalty will be imposed . " 
However , this does not definitively close the Ferrari engineer spy case . 
The Motor Sports Council also said in this decision : " If it is found in the future that the information relating to Ferrari has been used to the detriment of the championship , we reserve the right to request McLaren to return to WMSC for a hearing . At that time , they may face the penalty of the cancellation of their qualification to take part in the 2007 championship and even the 2008 championship . " 
Mike Coughlan , the former chief designer for McLaren who has now been suspended from his job , has been found to have been in possession of nearly 800 pages of Ferrari 's technical documents .

McLaren insists that no - one else in the team knew about this information before Coughlan was suspended from his job , and that the McLaren car for this season has no elements from Ferrari .

Experts Think Insurance QDIIs Will Not Divert Funds away from Domestic Stock Market in the Short Term 
Chinanews.com , July 30 
According to a report in China Securities Journal , the Provisional Measure for the Overseas Investment with Insurance Funds was recently published , and insurance funding has greater room for operation in the capital markets . 
China Life Insurance Company 's chief investment officer Liu Lefei thinks that with the renminbi appreciation and the domestic capital markets improving , insurance institutions will not make large investments overseas through foreign currency purchases in the short term . This also means that insurance QDIIs will not divert funds away from the domestic stock market in the short term . 
The report says that quite a few insurance institutions hold the same view . 
Experts say that because there is currently no renminbi derivatives market as yet , and the risk - avoidance techniques of insurance institutions are not sufficient , the time is not yet ripe for large - scale foreign currency purchases . 
Liu Lefei says that in the long term , in terms of asset allocation , overseas investment should occupy a certain proportion of an insurance company 's overall allocation . 
However , given the fairly large upwards pressure on the renminbi at present , China Life would mainly be using its own funds in foreign currencies for making overseas investment . 
In the current situation it should take a cautious attitude toward purchasing foreign currencies to invest overseas .

Bian Implies Criticism of Judiciary Getting Involved in Elections ; Taiwan 's " Judicial Yuan " Denies It and Demands His Explaination 
Chinanews.com , July 31 On the 30th Chen Shui - bian questioned that members of the judiciary on the island may have tried to get involved in elections for leaders in the Taiwan region . 
Kao Chin - chih , director - general of Taiwan 's " Department of Judicial Administration , " said on the same day that the current behavior of judges on the island was not as Chen Shui - bian said , and demanded that Chen Shui - bian give an explanation of his comments . 
According to reports in Taiwan 's United Daily , Chen Shui - bian questioned on the 30th that for political reasons or electoral considerations , judges , prosecutors or investigators may be interfering with , affecting or even trying to control the campaign activities of candidates from all parties . He said he hoped that this kind of phenomenon did not exist in Taiwan , but that it was perhaps extremely difficult . 
Weng Yueh - sheng , " president of the Judicial Yuan " in Taiwan , kept quiet and made no response to Chen Shui - bian 's questions , but " Secretary - General " Fan Kuang - chun sent Kao Chin - chih to make a statement on behalf of the " Judicial Yuan . " 
Kao Chin - chih said that Taiwan 's basic law and the " regulations for judges " both explicitly state that judges should be above party factions , must not take part in political party activities , and must not campaign , either . Judges were all extremely prudent and respected these relevant restrictions , and the " Judicial Yuan " believed that judges all acquit themselves admirably . 
Kao Chin - chih gave an example , saying that " High Court Kaohsiung Branch Court " judge Chang Sheng - hsi took part in a class at the Ketagalan Institute a few years ago , the self - regulation council organized by judges decided to punish him because the relevant syllabus had political party implications . 
Once Chang Sheng - hsi wanted to take part in the DPP primaries , but because of controversy over retaining his position and taking part in the election , he decided in the end to give up on it . 
Kao Chin - chih believes that if it 's specific judgments in cases , there is relief available at the court level , and one should not infer that judges have political intentions simply based on wins or losses in the verdicts . 
Germany Plans to Lower Threshold for Bringing in Professionals 
Staff Writer , Berlin , July 1 ( Correspondent Wang Huaicheng ) 
German Federal Minister of Education and Research Schavan said recently that Germany should lower the qualifying conditions for bringing in foreign professionals in the Immigration Law and solve the problem of the shortage of professionals that Germany is facing through increasing the recruitment of foreign talents . 
According to a report by OECD , by 2010 the number of workers between age 15 and 64 in Germany will be gradually decreasing each year . 
If there are not enough immigrants , the labor force in Germany in 2020 will decrease by 6 % as compared with the present . 
However , reports by organizations such as the German Employers Association and the German Association of Engineers show that there is a relatively large shortage of engineers and professionals in the current job market in Germany . 
According to the statistics from Germany 's Federal Labor Department , this May , the supply of engineers in the labor market in Germany had a shortfall of about 12,700 people and the supply of technicians had a shortfall of about 9,600 people . 
In order to protect native employment , Germany has set a relatively high threshold for bringing in foreign talents . 
Germany 's Immigration Law stipulates that professionals from non - EU countries should have annual salaries of no less than 85,500 euros in Germany , otherwise they cannot get the permit to work and live in Germany . 
Schavan suggests that this qualifying amount be reduced to 40,000 to 60,000 euros . 
Don 't Blindly Worship Legal " Theory Circle " 
It is stipulated in Article 8 of the draft amendment of the Lawyers Law which has been recently submitted to the NPC standing committee for review that people who were once engaged in the profession of researching and teaching laws and have obtained advanced professional titles or equivalent professional levels may be granted the permission to practice law when their applications for lawyers ' licenses pass the review by the judicial administrative department of the State Council . 
( June 28 , the China Youth Daily ) 
In the legal community there is a distinction between the " theory circle " and the " practice circle . " The former mainly includes the " abstract activities " such as teaching and researching laws , while the latter is more engaged in the " concrete activities " such as litigation , legal counseling , and legal services . 
For a long time there has existed a phenomenon of " scholars ' mutual contempt " between the legal " theory circle " and the " practice circle . " The " theory circle " believes that the " practice circle " lacks the necessary legal training and consists only of mechanical " legalists , " while the " practice circle " criticizes the " theory circle " by pointing out that " theory cannot direct practice . " 
With regard to such a labor division , what the law can do is to maintain neutrality rather than vigorously support either party . 
However , the " system of specially licensed lawyers " in the Lawyers Law acknowledges in reality the judgment that the legal " theory circle " is superior to the legal " practice circle . " 
In fact , some experts and scholars who have been engaged in the research and teaching of pure legal theories such as the history of the legal system and the international laws have nothing to do with practicing law no matter how profound their theoretical achievements have been . 
Thus , the " system of specially licensed lawyers " has doubtlessly opened up a " bad loophole " for confusing qualification in the legal " practice circle " which will have an extremely negative impact . 
There is also more blind worship of the " theory circle " than these . For example , the phenomenon that expert opinions and expert panels frequently influence and even negate court rulings is also a direct manifestation of such blind worship . 
Chinese - owned Vessels Encouraged to Sail under Five - Star Red Flag 
Staff Writer , Correspondent Feng Lei 
It was learned at the press conference held by the State Council Information Office that starting from July 1 this year , China will implement the Ad hoc Tax - free Registration Policy for Chinese - owned International Shipping Vessels to encourage Chinese - owned vessels flying foreign flags to register back in the country so as to acquire the nationality of the People 's Republic of China and sail under the five - star red flag . 
In order to further promote the healthy growth of the maritime shipping industry in our country and expand the national fleet and address the relevant problems arising from a considerable number of our country 's vessels engaged in international shipping registering overseas and operating under foreign flags , the Ministry of Communications has recently issued " The Public Notice Regarding the Implementation of the Ad hoc Tax - free Registration Policy for Chinese - owned International Shipping Vessels , " clarifying the conditions for enjoying the ad hoc tax - free policy and the application procedures . Starting from July 1 this year , eligible vessels which submit import declarations within two years shall be exempt from customs duties and import VAT . 
Applicant vessels may choose Shanghai , Tianjin , or Dalian as their ports of nationality to process vessel registration . 
Britain Lowers Terrorist Attack Alert Level 
Staff Writer , London , July 5 ( Correspondent Guo Lin ) 
On the 4th , the British government lowered the terrorist attack alert level from the highest level to the " severe " level . This shows that terrorist attacks in Britain will not be imminent , but attacks are still " highly likely . " 
At present , the British police has shifted its scope of investigation to India and Australia . 
Since the eight terrorist attack suspects that have been arrested had all worked in the medical system , the government will conduct an emergency investigation of the backgrounds of foreign immigrants who have been employed in the medical system . 
It was learned that nearly 90,000 people employed in the British public medical system have all obtained their qualification for practicing medicine from abroad . 
In addition Prime Minister Brown required that background checks be conducted for high - tech immigration applicants and that employers or relevant agencies shall be required to provide applicants ' background data . 
Keep Public Places from Harassment of Peddlers 
When people go out traveling , they are looking for relaxation , freshness , and freedom , enjoying as much as possible the natural scenery and achievements of civilized society . 
However , while traveling in the country , many people have experienced such nuisance as being besieged and cornered by peddlers and middlemen in public places . 
Whether you are getting on or off a bus or train , you invariably suffer the harassment of peddlers and some unlicensed middlemen . 
They either sell chicken eggs , peanuts , or sesame seed cakes , or newspapers and magazines . In addition , many unlicensed middlemen make referrals to restaurants and lodgings , even hawking fake certificates , fake receipts , and so on . 
If you don 't take them , he can chase you for several hundreds of meters as if he would rather die than fail . 
In some scenic spots , many tourists also have the same experience . 
Before you enter the main gate , someone would come to hawk things like tourist souvenirs and small pieces of arts and crafts . 
There are more scenarios of this kind after you go through the gate , which completely ruins even your best mood . 
Some media once reported that many foreign tourists coming to Xi 'an praised endlessly the places of historic interest and scenic beauty in Xi 'an , but felt it was incomprehensible that crowds of peddlers are allowed to hawk their wares everywhere . 
Such public places including bus stations and scenic spots are places meant for traveling and recreation . Attention should be paid to civility and orderliness as well as tranquility and harmony , providing tourists a comfortable and relaxing environment . 
The unrestricted entry and exit of peddlers not only disturb the mood of tourists , but also actually destroy the public order of these public places , giving rise to the visual contamination and environmental contamination , while providing the conditions and opportunities for lawless people to make trouble . 
The important thing is that these public places are the windows of spiritual civilization construction in the local areas . A small glimpse can reveal a larger picture . Not only the image is being damaged but the growth of local economy will also be impacted . 
Just imagine , if you want to expand and strengthen the tourism industry but welcome guests traveling from all directions with such a messy tourist environment , who will still want to come , and who still dare to come ? 
Then how can your tourist economy gain returns ? 
As the tourist high season approaches , creating a civilized tourist environment for tourists coming from all directions should be considered the top priority . 
Public places are not markets . The operation by peddlers should be regulated . Unlicensed operation must be resolutely banned , and there should be relentless crackdown on illegal activities . 
Only a civilized and orderly environment can get tourists to come happily , who will leave after fully enjoying themselves and keep the passion for a return trip . 
In a word , keep public places from the harassment of peddlers . 
" Rewarding Voluntary Withdrawal from Welfare System " Does Not Hold Water 
The Jianguomen Neighborhood in Dongcheng District of Beijing gave away things like refrigerators as rewards to twelve households that voluntarily withdrew from the welfare system . 
( The Beijing News , July 10 ) 
While feeling happy for these families for the improvement of their lives , this writer is ambivalent toward the proposal of " voluntary withdrawal from the welfare system " and the " reward - giving " method . 
The deputy director of the Jianguomen Neighborhood office said , " In response to the issue of the welfare fraud , encouraging voluntary withdrawal from the welfare system aims to set a good example for other households on welfare . " 
If it is to encourage other welfare recipients to get out of their difficult situations through their own efforts , then this example is indeed worth promoting . If this is intended to " appeal " to those longtime cheaters of the welfare system , then it may be a bit naive . 
Working to distinguish between real and fake welfare recipients and sort them out , we should rely more on the law . 
The relevant department should stress the obligations that welfare recipients must carry out while enjoying the welfare : for example , promptly notifying the changes in the family members and incomes , reporting the status of employment , accepting regular reviews , etc. On the other hand , the relevant department should step up monitoring and inspection . 
After all , only " withdrawing from the welfare system according to the law " is the long - term strategy . 
Who will foot the bill for the material rewards given by the neighborhood to the households that withdrew from the welfare system ? 
As a level - one government organization , the neighborhood 's expenses are covered by the funding from the government budget . 
However , is it legitimate to spend this sum of tax payers ' money ? 
On the one hand , households that have withdrawn from the welfare system prove that they have attained certain abilities to be " self - sufficient ; " on the other hand , aren 't there still people who apply for the welfare ? 
The funding from the government budget which is called " life - saving " money should be used to provide timely help instead of extra bonus . 
Liu Gangyi 's Remark about His Willingness to Be a Service Provider Is More Believable 
On July 10 , Liu Gangyi , the party committee secretary of Mulan Township , Xindu District , Chengdu City , who is the first township party committee secretary through public nomination and direct election in the whole country , received his fourth democratic evaluation since he took office . The rate of satisfaction reached 97 % . 
During his conversation with reporters , Liu Gangyi defined himself as a " service provider . " 
( Yesterday , The Beijing News ) 
The " service provider " as spoken by Liu Gangyi is probably more truthful and more believable than the " service provider " as spoken by some appointed cadres . 
The greatest advantage of public nomination and direct election as compared with the system of appointment lies in the fact that in the former the source of power is mainly determined by ordinary party members and the masses , while in the latter it is mainly appointed by upper - level organizations . And where the power originates determines that the former must take its responsibility to the general public as top priority . 
The source of power and to whom they should answer are the basic factors that determine how the elected will go about their work . 
Some people suspect that this kind of " democratic evaluation " is more like a " democracy show . " 
My opinion is that it is better to have this form of " democratic evaluation " than nothing at all . 
Considering the history and current status of China 's grassroots democratic and political construction , I think that it is already a major breakthrough to have public nomination and direction election . Being a major component of this innovation , the democratic evaluation is not to be underestimated in promoting the grassroots democratic and political construction . 
First Woman President Expected to Be Elected in India ; Analysts Call Her Election Quite Likely ; Female Voters Hope She Can Raise the Status of Women 
On June 23 , Patil brought her hands together palm to palm before she filled the presidential candidate documents . 
India 's presidential election kicked off on the 19th . The new president will be chosen between the current vice president Shekhawat and Pratibha Patil , who recently resigned as governor of Rajasthan . 
Patil is the first woman presidential candidate in the history of India . If she is elected , she will become the first woman president ever in the Indian history . 
Patil is the presidential candidate for the ruling party INC , while Shekhawat is from the opposition party BJP . 
Since the INC occupies a dominant position in the presidential electoral college , the media and the general public all speculate that Patil is rather likely to be elected . 
Patil , currently 72 years old , was a woman governor of Rajasthan . 
She was born into a lawyer 's family and entered the parliament in 1985 . With rich experiences in politics , she was well acclaimed by the government during her tenure as governor of Rajasthan . 
In addition she is devoted to the social welfare and is the honorary chairperson of many cultural , educational , and social welfare organizations . 
Analysts pointed out that the reason why Patil became a candidate is because she has remained loyal to the INC president Sonia Gandhi . 
In India the Gandhi family has controlled the ruling INC party for a long time . 
Patil is supported and respected by a large number of female voters . Female voters believe that Patil will reshape the image of women and raise the status of women in India , where discrimination against females is a dominant ideology . 
The constitution stipulates that India is a federal - system country . The president is the nominal head of state and commander of the armed forces , representing no party organization and serving more as a symbol .

US Supports Pakistani Government in Ousting Extremists 
Staff Writer , Washington , July 22 ( Correspondent Xu Qisheng ) 
US President Bush said on the 21st that the US will fully support the Pakistani government in driving al Qaeda and Taliban extremists out of the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan . 
In his regular weekly radio address that day , Bush said that according to the latest US intelligence , al Qaeda has found a " safe haven " in the area of Pakistan bordering Afghanistan . 
He expressed " serious concern " over this . 
Bush said that the US will continue to support Pakistani President Musharraf , believing that Musharraf will persistently fight against al Qaeda and Taliban militants . 
It is noted in the National Intelligence Estimate report recently released by the US that Islamic militant organizations , Bin Laden 's al Qaeda in particular , still constitute a persistent threat to the US . 
The agreement reached by Musharraf and some tribal leaders in the northern region of Pakistan last September on guarding against the remnant forces of the Taliban and activities of al Qaeda members has failed to achieve the expected result . 
These tribal leaders " were unwilling or unable " to maintain the security of the region on their own . 
In this prerecorded address , Bush said that Musharraf is taking active steps to correct this mistake .

Staff Writer , Washington , July 24 ( Correspondent Xu Qisheng ) 
Hill , US assistant secretary of state and US chief representative to the six - party talks on the North Korea nuclear issue , said on the 23rd that the six - party talks on the North Korea nuclear issue held last week is very important .

The US hopes very much that the September 19 Joint Statement and the February 13 Joint Document regarding the resolution of the North Korea nuclear issue can be fully implemented in 2008 . 
At the press conference held that day , Hill said that in order to achieve the goal of completely resolving the North Korea nuclear issue in 2008 , it is necessary that North Korea declare its entire nuclear program and disable its nuclear facilities by the end of this year . 
He hopes that all relevant parties can fully implement the agreement reached at the six - party talks on the North Korea nuclear issue within a year . 
In addition Hill said that while holding talks on security and energy resources issues , the US - North Korea and Japan - North Korea working groups will also respectively discuss the outstanding issues in the bilateral relations between the US and North Korea as well as Japan and North Korea . 
Climate Change Leads to Rapid Shrinking of Alps Glacier 
Staff Writer , Geneva , July 29 ( Correspondent Liu Jun ) 
A long - term follow - up research by glacier experts at the Swiss Academy of Sciences found that from 1850 to 2005 the 1,800 plus glaciers in Switzerland were shrinking at an annual rate of 3 % . 
The heat wave in 2003 alone caused the Alps glacier to melt by 1.8 % 
Experts believe that if the global temperature rises by 3 degrees Celsius by 2100 , the glaciers will have shrunk by 80 % compared with the present and that with a temperature rise of 5 degrees Celsius , the glaciers will have entirely melted . 
The Aletsch glacier is the longest glacier in Europe and has been inscribed on the list of the UNESCO Natural World Heritage . However , from 2005 to 2006 , it shrank by 100 meters within a year . There can be no more delay in protecting the natural environment .

Toll of Eternal Warning Bell " Links up " with Hong Kong as the World Jointly Celebrates Ten Years of Reversion 
On July 1 , the Eternal Warning Bell in the Memorial Hall of Nanjing 's Jinghai Temple was tolled once again , the sound of the bell ringing melodiously . 
This rich echo of history connected the mainland and Hong Kong via television , as the citizens of Nanjing and Hong Kong compatriots " shared the same occasion from the far corners of the earth " and celebrated together the tenth anniversary of Hong Kong 's reversion to the motherland . 
Ten years previously , at 12:00 a.m. on July 1 , the sound of the tolling of the Eternal Warning Bell reverberated 155 times in the sky over the bell tower of the Memorial Hall of Nanjing 's Jinghai Temple , bidding farewell to the humiliating history of the cession of Hong Kong island . 
People from all walks of life in Nanjing society gathered together in front of the gate of the smallish Memorial Hall . They said that they wanted to give an eternal warning to themselves and to later generations not to forget history by ringing this Eternal Warning Bell with their own two hands . 
" The bell of the Eternal Warning Bell is 1.842 meters high , and the year 1842 was precisely when the ' Nanjing Treaty ' was concluded at the time of the eruption of the Opium War . 
The shoulder of the bell is 1.997 meters high , and 1997 was the year of Hong Kong 's reversion . " 
The man behind the devising and casting of the Eternal Warning Bell that year , Wang Fengling , explained that " there are five 'wan ' character inscriptions around the body of the bell . The whole copper bell is in high relief , with two dragons supporting a fireball , symbolizing the fact that Hong Kong is the motherland 's ' Pearl of the Orient . ' Finally , Nanjing 's city flower , the plum blossom , forms the pattern on the body of the bell where the bell is struck . " 
Yu Xiaodong , a member of the Democratic Party and the first person back then to propose the construction of the Eternal Warning Bell sighed with emotion , saying , " Before we knew it , it has been ten years already since the reversion of Hong Kong . " He hopes that Hong Kong 's tomorrow could be like the sound of that tolling bell , " resounding and melodious , ongoing and everlasting . "

Russia 's Security Service Accuses Exiled Oligarch Berezovsky of " Plotting to Launch a Coup d ' Etat " 
A lawyer for Berezovsky , the Russian oligarch in exile in London , Borovkov , announced on July 2 that the Russian Federal Security Service had formally issued a new charge against his client , accusing Berezovsky of " plotting to engineer a coup d ' ¨ ¦ tat and attempting a violent seizure of political power in Russia . " 
Borovkov pointed out that in April this year Berezovsky had announced during an interview with a journalist from the British " Guardian " newspaper that he was preparing to launch a " palace coup " in Russia , and confirmed that he was providing financial support to representatives of the right - wing elite opposed to the policies of the administration . 
The Russian Federal Security Service 's investigation bureau immediately launched a criminal investigation against Berezovsky under article 278 on " forcible seizure of power " of the Penal Code of the Russian Federation , and has formally brought forward related charges in Moscow 's Savyolovsky court recently . 
It is reported that the Russian Procuratorate - General brought criminal charges against Berezovsky in February 2006 , similarly based on the exiled oligarch 's confirmation during an interview that he was attempting a seizure of state power by force in Russia . 
As Berezovsky has remained in exile abroad , making it impossible to extradite him , Russia authorities temporarily suspended the investigation of the case in January 2007 . 
On July 2 , Moscow 's Savyolovsky court began to hear another criminal case against the exiled oligarch . The Russian Procuratorate - General accused Berezovsky of embezzling funds of 214 million roubles from Aeroflot and laundering 16 million roubles . After the hearing the court decided to postpone judicial investigation into this case till July 12 , and a state defense lawyer will be assigned for the defendant in this period . 
Berezovsky believes that this is all a " farce , " and has explicitly prohibited his defense lawyer from taking part in the court hearings .

Two Jordanese Sentenced for Plotting an Attack on Americans 
Two Jordanese men were sentenced by the Jordanian State Security Court on the 11th for plotting to attack Americans in Jordan . 
Of the two men , both aged 25 , one called Sameeh al - Hotari was sentenced to 8 years ' imprisonment with forced labor , and the other called Mohammed Shehada was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment with forced labor . 
A court official said that al - Hotari was also charged with illegal possession of firearms , and that the police had found an assault rifle while searching his place of residence . 
The court originally decided to sentence al - Hotari to life imprisonment , but later considered giving him an opportunity to " turn over a new leaf , " and reduced the sentence to 8 years . 
According to the indictment , after the outbreak of the Iraq war the two accused decided to avenge the Muslims who were " being bullied by the Americans , " and plotted to attack Americans living in Jordan . 
In August 2006 they selected as a target an American living in a suburb of the Jordanian capital , Amman , but were arrested by the police before carrying out an attack on him . 
The identity of this American was not made public in the indictment . 
The indictment also charged the two defendants with planning to attack other Americans , but no concrete details were divulged .

Number of Reports of Adverse Reactions Caused by Diabetic Medicine , Avandia , Increases Sharply 
According to a report in the US media on the 15th , there has recently been a trend in the US towards a sharp increase in the number of reports of heart diseases and other adverse reactions caused by Avandia , an anti - diabetic medicine . 
In May this year the US Food and Drug Administration issued a safety warning , recommending that sufferers from diabetes exercise caution when using Avandia , because a scientist had published a research report in the edition of the New England Journal of Medicine that came out on May 21 , saying that this best - selling drug could greatly increase the incidence of and death rate from heart disease among sufferers . 
Consequently , the safety of Avandia has received close attention by doctors and patients . 
Statistics show that in the approximately one month following the issuing of the safety warning , the US FDA had received 357 reports of adverse reactions caused by Avandia , of which 38 were reports of deaths . 
And yet the FDA had received just 50 and 73 reports of adverse reactions in January and February this year respectively . 
These adverse reactions ranged from being as trivial as getting blisters to as serious as sudden deaths from heart disease . 
However , the US FDA 's pharmaceuticals experts believe that it would currently be premature to reach the conclusion that Avandia is not safe . 
The FDA will hold a hearing into the safety of Avandia on July 30 . 
Avandia , which came on the market in 1999 , is an insulin sensitizer , suitable for treating Type 2 diabetes . 
Some 6 million diabetes sufferers worldwide have taken or are taking Avandia . 
Avandia 's producer , the British company GlaxoSmithKline , continues to believe that Avandia is safe , and that for suffers " the benefits outweigh the drawbacks . " 
US Wishes to Restart Middle East Peace Talks 
US President Bush gave an address on the 16th in Washington , calling for the holding of an international conference on the Palestine - Israel issue this fall , and inviting Israel , Palestine and some of the surrounding Arab countries and other countries concerned to take part , in order to jointly push for the restarting of the Middle East peace process . 
On the 17th , Bush also made separate phone calls to Egypt 's President Mubarak , Jordan 's King Abdullah II , and Saudi Arabia 's King Abdullah , asking them to respond positively to this proposal , give practical support to Abbas , the president of the Palestinian National Authority , and help the Palestinians and the Israelis to resume peace talks at an early date . 
Abbas Says the PLO Central Committee Will Discuss the Issue of Bringing Forward the Palestinian General Election 
The president of the Palestinian National Authority , Abbas , said in Ramallah on the 18th that the two - day conference of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) Central Committee had been inaugurated on the same day , and that the conference would discuss bringing forward the holding of elections for the Palestinian National Authority and the Legislative Council and other issues . 
On the same day Abbas met the EU High Representative for foreign and security affairs , Solana , in the Ramallah Presidential Office , and said at the subsequent joint press conference that if the PLO Central Committee made the relevant resolutions , the president would have the power to issue a " legal , effective " decree , and a decree of this type would be issued quickly . 
At the same time , Abbas felt satisfied with relations between the Palestinian National Authority and the EU . 
He said that Palestine welcomed the EU 's understanding of measures adopted by the Palestinian Presidential Office .

US Department of Defense Reconsiders Plans to Reduce US Troops in Europe 
An official in the US Department of Defense said on the 23rd that due to the Iraq war and changes in the world situation , the US Department of Defense is reconsidering a plan drawn up in 2002 to cut the number of US troops in Europe by approximately half . 
The US media cited a Department of Defense official as saying that due to the ongoing Iraq war and the worsening US relations with Russia and Iran , Department of Defense leaders have raised doubts about the feasibility of plans to cut troops in Europe . 
In 2002 the then Secretary of Defense Rumsfield announced that the US would reduce troop numbers in Europe from the original 113,000 to 71,000 before 2012 , in order to create a new - style army with " fewer , but better " soldiers . 
The US army 's total forces in Europe have currently fallen to 100,000 people . 
But in June this year , Commander Craddock of the US Army Headquarters in Europe submitted a report to the current secretary of defense , Gates , raising doubts over the above - mentioned reduction plan . 
The report said that while US army forces are being reduced in Europe , many military units would be deployed on a rotation basis to Iraq and Afghanistan for combat , leading to a shortfall in US troops in Europe to such an extent that there would be no way to develop normal cooperation with European allies . 
The report recommended halting the plan to reduce US troops in Europe . 
Relevant US experts believe that the above - mentioned phenomenon shows that the prolonged and unresolved Iraq war has disrupted the original US military 's restructuring plans .

Three Main Functions of Modern Military Uniform 
The first is the identification function . 
It is an important sign that distinguishes the armies of different countries , different military services , and between the military and civilians . 
In the armies of more than 100 large and small countries of the world , although the use of military uniform is basically identical , there are no two countries ' armies whose military uniforms are completely the same . 
The second is the symbolic function . 
To a certain extent , military uniform is both a reflection of a country 's mental outlook and its national characteristics , and is also a concentrated embodiment of a country 's military ability to wage war and the quality of its servicemen . 
In the three main types of military uniform - - ceremonial attire , everyday uniforms , and drill uniforms - - the one that can express national prestige and military prestige to the fullest extent is none other than ceremonial attire that is well - pressed and pleasing to the eye . 
The third is the protective function . 
With the rapid development of high - tech and updated weaponry , improving the overall protective capacity of new - style drill uniforms to give military uniform various types of functions - - including bulletproofing , stealth protection , anti - chemical , anti - bacterial and anti - radiation functions , as well as control of the temperature , humidity and the air - - has become a key issue in the development of military uniform .

A Brigade Party Committee Organ Has the Courage to Handle Thorny Issues Properly 
Staff Writer , Chengdu , July 3 
Report by Qu Yimao and Yang Ruiyu : " We can now move into apartments as a result of the brigade party committee organ 's resolution and boldness in freeing up the apartments . " 
Today , more than ten cadres in a communications drill brigade in Chengdu Military Command were all beaming with pleasure as they moved into apartments . They felt full of admiration and gratitude for the way the " group " on the brigade party committee dared to confront tough obstacles in solving thorny issues . 
Over the past few years , along with the replacement of personnel , an excessive part of the brigade 's accommodation for family members had been occupied against regulations , making it difficult to house the cadres on active duty . Officers and men had quite strong views about this . 
The brigade had tried to free up the apartments several times , but failed to get it done each time due to all kinds of obstruction , allowing the problem to become a long - standing , big and difficult issue . 
" As long as we have the courage to do things properly and are fair and reasonable , there are no difficulties we cannot solve . " 
After the group on the new party committee had reached a consensus , the principal leaders appeared in person and set about thoroughly sorting out all the problems relating to occupation of apartments against regulations . 
On the one hand they appealed to people 's emotions and explained their reasoning , hoping that the personnel concerned would consider the whole picture ; on the other hand , they explained the policies and regulations relating to military apartments , apartments built with pooled money , and economical and adequate apartments , to show the party committee 's staunch determination and principled stance . 
In the case of personnel who had accommodation elsewhere and were not willing to leave the additional apartments they occupied , the party committee organ promptly made contact with the work units they were in and adopted relevant measures to encourage them to take the initiative in cooperating with the work of the army . 
Over two months of meticulous work , all residents occupying additional apartments in the army barracks against regulations had all moved out on schedule , and cadres who worked in the brigade were all assigned the accommodation in accordance with regulations . 
The way in which this brigade party committee dared to confront tough obstacles has also given rise to a chain reaction . Several cadres who originally were unwilling to actively cooperate with the organization 's allotment have now one by one also expressed their willingness to obey the organization 's decisions .

People 's Armed Force Department in Jingjiang City Sets up a Platform to Raise the Quality of Their Full - time Cadres 
Staff Writer , Report by Cao Jiawei and Zhu Chunbin : On June 18 , at a training class for People 's Armed Force full - time cadres in Jingjiang city in Jiangsu province , Lu Yuqing , leader of the People 's Armed force department of Xilai township , delivered a training lecture " Winning a Psychological War under Informationalized Conditions " that received a unanimous favorable assessment from the trainees . 
This was a new change that was brought about by the city 's People 's Armed Force when it has put more pressure on its cadres based on the reality of their positions in an effort to raise People 's Armed Force cadres ' comprehensive quality . 
At the beginning of this year , the People 's Armed force party committee discovered during investigation and research at the grassroots level that some of the People 's Armed Force cadres had served for a long time , had too many concurrent duties , and had not put their chief energies into the armed force work . 
For this reason , they have adopted methods including centralized training , replacing training with meetings , and relying on local party schools to conduct training , thus regularly training military cadres , in an effort to resolve problems such as the narrow knowledge base and the uniform focus of the professional quality of military cadres . 
In combination with the central work , they boldly assign tasks to military cadres and put more pressure on them , and raise their performance by on - the - job training . 
At the same time , they have actively coordinated with local organizational departments and jointly drafted the " People 's Armed Forces Cadres ' Competition for Jobs Scheme , " and explicitly stipulated that the leaders of People 's Armed Forces departments must join the party committee of the same level and cannot concurrently take on other jobs . 
They have set up a military cadres ' restructuring exchange mechanism to promptly regulate exchanges on some older military cadres who are not suitable for grassroots People 's Armed forces work , and promote and use some comrades of good comprehensive quality and strong work ability . 
Not long ago , a domestic gap was filled by the underwater boat - welding technology invented and developed by the People 's Militia technology platoon under the leadership of the secretary of the armed department of the New Century Shipbuilding Company Limited , Chen Yisong , who was exceptionally promoted as the company 's armed department leader . 
When You Start Well , You Still Need to Finish Well 
Judging simply from the result of the match , 2 - 2 seems a reasonable score , and is also one that the Chinese team can accept . The key problem is that the way the match went made people feel it was rather a pity . 
If the Iranian team had taken a 2 - 0 lead , then the Chinese team had evened up the score , then the feeling that would have given China 's sports fans would certainly have been different . It would have boosted morale . The pity was that the situation was precisely the opposite . 
You could say that starting well but being unable to finish well is an old problem of the Chinese team . 
The Chinese team often don 't kick the ball when they have an excellent chance , and most people 's view is that the psychological quality of China 's players is not really up to it . 
This is actually one reason why the Chinese team cannot " finish well . " 
However , judging by the Chinese team 's match today , it may not be quite so . 
Even if we set aside the fact that Sun Jihai , Sun Xiang , Shao Jiayi , Zheng Zhi and others have played in Europe , Li Weifeng and others are also old - timers with long experience of the battlefield . They have experience and knowledge , and so it would be reasonable to say that there should not be any problem with their psychological quality . 
The reason why the Chinese team was regrettably forced to a draw by the Iranian team this time may be because they deployed their forces in a lackadaisical manner at key points of the match . 
When the Iranian team were behind , they substituted two persons , and the scene immediately seemed different . 
In the second half , the Chinese team also substituted three players , but without a positive effect . 
To overcome the problem of starting well but being unable to finish well , it is definitely necessary to pinpoint the source of the problem . 
As long as the problem is correctly grasped , it will probably not be difficult to find a way to get rid of the problem . 
The worst thing when you have a serious illness is just to go to see any doctor . 
If they carry on like this , no matter how many matches the Chinese team play , the old problem will still continue , and the constant progress with every game that everyone expects will be out of the question .

" Small , Scattered , Far and Direct " Education Coordination Zones Go into Operation in a Second Artillery Unit Base 
Staff Writer , Report by Xue Bingjian and Correspondent Xu Yeqing : The situation in the " small , scattered , far and direct " units where education organization is difficult , resources are meager , and each fends for itself , will become history at a second artillery unit base . 
This correspondent learned recently that following a half - year pilot project , this base has handed down " The Method of Fully Implementing ' An Outline for Ideological and Political Education ' . " A number of ideological and political education coordination zones covering all the " small , scattered , far and direct " units in the base have officially been brought into operation . 
In order to push ahead with the effective implementation of " An Outline for Ideological and Political Education , " the base organized resources at the beginning of the year to conduct in - depth investigation and research of the ideological and political education situation in " small , scattered , far and direct " units . They combed through important issues that influence and restrict the education time , personnel and results , and initially established this new - style education model of coordination zones for the " small , scattered , far and direct " units . 
The concrete approach of coordination zones is to break down the organizational boundaries among units and set up a brigade and regiment - level unit to take the lead in the areas where the " small , scattered , far and direct " units are relatively concentrated , and conduct an integrated program for thematic education , with units falling under different hierarchies coming together in nearby places for lectures or using the help of video link - up systems for remote discussions . 
They have adopted a method that integrates taking turns in giving lessons and competing for posts , and unifying the allocation of educational resources . In each area the use of educational hardware will be integrated , and each unit 's materials , data and educational experiences will be shared and exchanged with those of others , with regular organization in each area of typical tour reports and exchanges of what they got from the study by the officers and men . 
Every coordination zone has set up a devoted educational liaison person and a part - time educational information gatherer . 
On this basis , each coordination zone has also set up systems for seeking assistance on difficult issues , holding joint discussions on major educational themes , reporting critical ideological situations , and assessing tests and evaluations . 
Zhang Shengmin , the director of the base 's political department , told this correspondent that constructing political education coordination zones has both reduced the waste of educational resources and deepened the impact of education . 
Some political instructors fear they will lose marks in front of officers and men from other units and have taken the initiative to study new things and seek new educational methods . 
The officers and men receiving the education have also enthusiastically digested the educational content , out of concern over expressing themselves in layman 's language in front of the officers and men of friendly neighboring units during discussion and analysis . 
In this way , the enthusiasm of the people giving and receiving education has been both effectively stimulated . 
A North China Sea Fleet Repair Brigade Fully Allocates its R&R Quota to Sailors 
Staff Writer , Report by Zhang Junhong and Liu Hongjun : On July 17 , led by vice - chief engineer Zhang Weiliang of a North China Sea fleet repair brigade , 31 of the brigade 's long - serving frontline repair sailors happily stepped on a train to go to Beidaihe for a period of rest and recuperation . 
Luo Xiangming , an NCO class , happily told this writer , " That the brigade 's leaders care about and cherish the sailors deeply moves us . After a period of rest and recuperation , we will definitely work doubly hard ! " 
This is actually the first time that this brigade has organized rest and recuperation for grassroots sailors . 
Not long ago , the brigade commander Yao Qingsheng went down to the grassroots units and saw that sailors responsible for repair work were braving high temperatures to carry out equipment maintenance and repair work , deeply moving Yao Qingsheng . 
" As the sailors work selflessly , the party committee should care about and cherish the sailors , and take responsibility for the sailors ' health . " At a meeting of the party committee , Yao Qingsheng 's words were endorsed by everyone . 
After looking into the matter , the party committee reached a decision to give the entire R&R quota allocated to the brigade by senior authorities to the sailors doing repair work on the frontline . 
Doing Things Openly in a Ji 'nan Military Command Unit Takes Heat off " Hot - Button Issues " 
Staff Writer 
Report by Wang Weiqin and Specially Contracted Correspondent Li Deying : On July 25 , this writer observed in a service support company of the Ji 'nan Military Command that invitations for an army engineering tender , details of financial expenditure , promotions of cadres , non - commissioned officers being admitted to the Party and other major matters were written up on a bulletin board , and hung up conspicuously in a display cabinet . 
As Political Commissar Su Chengsen explained , this is a concrete measure adopted by the section to promote a system where things are done openly . 
At the beginning of this year , the unit party committee drew up measures including " Two - way Supervision Between the Organization and the Grassroots " and " Publicizing Sensitive Issues " to strengthen the construction of the party spirit and honest government , requiring that for all significant issues that involve the direct interests of the officers and men and army development , the opinions of grassroots officers and men are first heard before decisions are reached , and that standards , procedures , and results etc of the handling of the matters are made public from start to finish in line with the circumstances . 
The unit has installed a suggestion box and a bulletin board , and has opened a " message board " on its Intranet to collect everyone 's views and recommendations in an extensive way . 
At the beginning of the year , as the renovation project of the soldiers ' barracks was about to start , before the work began , the party committee organ extensively solicited the views of the officers and men , and then released the information on inviting bids , implementing a system of open tenders . 
This both saved money and won the support of the officers and men . 
Doing things in an open and fair way has driven the formation of a good atmosphere at the grassroots . 
In this unit , the grassroots company insists on making regular public announcements and notices , no matter whether they are issues as big as the determination of " hot - button " sensitive matters , or as trivial as personal vacations to visit relatives or daily income and expenditure in the mess accounts , thus taking the initiative to receive the supervision of the masses . 
( International ) Research Shows a Link between Arrhythmia and Two Forms of Genetic Variation 
Xinhua News Agency , London , July 2 Icelandic scientists have discovered through research that the risk of arrhythmia among people with two types of genetic variation in their bodies is far greater than among ordinary people . 
According to a report in the latest issue of Nature magazine , after researchers at Iceland 's deCode Genetics Inc sifted through the genes of thousands of people from Iceland , Sweden , and the US , as well as China 's Hong Kong region , they made the above - mentioned discovery . 
The two genes discovered by the scientists are located close to a gene that plays an important role in the early growth of the heart . 
Arrhythmia , namely atrial fibrillation , is one of the most common clinically observed irregularities of the rhythm of the heart , and can lead to heart palpitations , shortness of breath , tiredness as well as apoplectic fits . 
And according to a report in the Nature Genetics magazine that came out on the 1st , researchers at deCode Genetics Inc have also discovered two genes on the 17th chromosome in human beings that is connected to the onset of cancer in the prostate gland .

According to a report in the Venezuelan media on the 3rd , the US team 's 37 - year - old veteran goalkeeper , Keller , said during an interview here that if he could not find a suitable club to serve in after the America 's Cup , then he would opt to retire . 
" If I have not been able to get a contract for 1 - 2 seasons with a high - quality league team within four to six weeks of the conclusion of the America 's Cup , then maybe retiring will not be a bad choice for me . " 
With the relegation of the M ? chengladbach team to the 2nd Bundesliga , Keller also left this soccer team in which he had served for more than two seasons . 
Although Keller has a mind to retire , he has many opportunities and clearly need not worry about finding a place . He himself has frankly stated that there are currently as many as eight soccer teams that are interested in inviting him to join them . 
However , this veteran goalkeeper who has served in league matches for the Spanish Primera Liga , the English Premiership , and the German Bundesliga , said that what he ultimately chooses to do will be decided by his family . " My kid is already 9 years old . He has followed me around and stayed in three different countries , and has been to three different schools , and so I need to consider in my current choice what would be better for my family . " 
In the Gold Cup competition that was concluded not long ago , Keller put in an outstanding performance , helping the US team to win the title . 
In the current America 's cup , he has , just as before , been given an important job to do by head coach Bradley , but he clearly cannot win the match singlehanded . The US team , made up of " young guards , " is no match for such strong South American opponents as Argentina and Paraguay , and during these two matches the goal he guarded was breached seven times . 
The next match against Colombia will probably be the US team 's and Keller 's last performance in this America 's Cup competition .

The Resignation of 13 Pilots Leads China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Company to a Countersuit for Compensation of More than 100 Million Yuan 
Xinhua News Agency , Wuhan , July 11 ( Correspondents Liu Yang and Pi Shuchu ) 
When 13 pilots handed in their resignations , their " boss , " the China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Co . Ltd asked them for compensation for a huge sum of up to 105 million . This is the largest sum claimed in damages so far in a labor dispute case in Hubei province . 
The Labor Dispute Arbitration Commission of Hubei province is currently trying this case . 
In May this year , 13 pilots with China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Company in succession handed in their resignations , which were rejected by the company . 
Soon afterwards , the pilots applied one after another at the beginning of June to the Labor Dispute Arbitration Commission of Hubei province for labor arbitration , requesting for a ruling that their labor relationship with China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Company be terminated . 
After China Eastern Airlines Wuhan Company received notice of the suit , it advanced a counterclaim and requested that the 13 pilots pay for losses caused by their breaking their labor contract agreements and canceling their labor contracts , ranging from more than 6 million yuan to 10 million yuan respectively , totaling 105 million yuan . 
It has been learned that the labor contract the pilots signed with China Eastern Airlines was of unfixed duration . Unless the conditions agreed in the labor contract for breaking off or canceling the agreement applied , the labor contract was to remain in force until the pilots ' legal retirement age . 
The Labor Dispute Arbitration Commission of Hubei province will try and deal with this case as a suit and a countersuit together , and it is hoped that the hearing will be over by August 8 . 
( International ) Germany Calls on Russia to Ratify Latvian - Russian Border Treaty as Soon as Possible 
Xinhua News Agency , Riga , July 12 ( Correspondent Yang Dehong ) German Foreign Minister Steinmeier currently visiting Latvia called on Russia on the 12th to ratify the Latvian - Russian border treaty as soon as possible . 
On that day Steinmeier held talks with Latvian Foreign Minister Pabriks . The two sides mainly discussed issues such as Latvian - German relations and Latvian cooperation with the EU , and exchanged opinions and views on the development of Latvian - Russian relations and EU - Russian relations . 
In the press conference held after the talks , Steinmeier called on Russia to ratify the Latvian - Russian border treaty as soon as possible . 
Steinmeier said that steps towards an improvement in relations between Latvia and all the countries in the Baltic Sea region and Russia have been relatively slow , and that the process of signing the Latvian - Russian border treaty bears witness to a process of development in Latvian - Russian relations , but " the shadow of history " may also cause Latvian - Russian relations to go backwards once again . He hoped that Russia can ratify the Latvian - Russian border treaty as soon as possible , in order to promote forward development in the two countries ' relationship . 
On March 27 this year , after talks lasting 10 years , Latvian Prime Minister Kalvitis and Russian Prime Minister Fradkov signed a bilateral border treaty in Moscow . 
On May 17 the Latvian parliament ratified the Latvian - Russian border treaty . 
According to a report in the Latvian media , the Russian parliament will hold a vote on the treaty in the near future .

Representatives of the militaries of North Korea and South Korea held military talks and routine contacts in Panmunjom on the 16th , and the two sides agreed after discussion that they will hold their sixth colonel - level military talks from the 24th to the 26th .

He said that in order to set up a joint fishing zone , it is necessary to implement the principles such as those of seeking maximum common national prosperity and benefits and of safeguarding peaceful and secure fishing operations . 
While talking about the issue of the bilaterally disputed maritime border , Pak Rim Su said that in order to prevent military conflict between the two sides in the West Sea , the two sides should renounce the maritime borders they have hitherto insisted on , recognize and respect each other 's rights to territorial seas , and accept as the basis for negotiations the relevant agreements between North Korea and South Korea , the Korean armistice agreement , and internationally recognized law . 
He said that the " persistent standpoint " of the North Korean military was to promptly draw up military safeguard measures in order to promote cooperative exchanges between North and South Korea . 
He said that the South Korean side should adopt military measures right now to ensure that North Korean civilian vessels can sail directly south from Haeju port and freely pass through the Jeju Straits . 
This has been the second round of military talks and routine contacts held recently between both North and South Korea since the 10th of this month . 
The fifth colonel - level military talks between North and South Korea was held on May 8 - 11 in Panmunjom in a " unity pavilion " on the North Korean side . 
( International ) Hyundai Motor Denies Its Intention to Buy Volvo 
Xinhua News Agency , Seoul , July 18 A spokesperson for the South Korean Hyundai Motor Company said in Seoul on the 18th that the company had no intention of buying Volvo or any brand controlled by the Ford Motor Company .

( Sports ) Cuba Complains a Boxing Ring 's Rope is Too Short 
Xinhua News Agency , Rio de Janeiro , July 21 ( Correspondents Chen Weihua and Leng Tong ) 
The Cuban delegation complained on the 21st that the rope around the boxing ring at this Pan - American Games is too short and will affect the boxers ' performance . 
According to the regulations of the International Boxing Union , during international matches the rope around the boxing ring should be 6.1 meters , but according to measurements by the Cuban delegation 's boxing team coach , Pedro Roque , the length of the rope around the boxing ring at this Pan - American Games is over 1 meter shorter than the norm . 
Roque said , " We have submitted a formal protest , because this matter does not affect just one country , Cuba , but involves everyone . 
An excessively short rope will affect the boxers ' dodging movements . " 
He also joked , " If they can 't find a rope conforming to Olympic standards in Rio , they can go and look somewhere else . 
If we had known earlier , we would have brought one from Cuba . " 
The Mexican and Colombian delegations also expressed dissatisfaction on that day with the length of the rope around the boxing ring . 
Although the Colombian boxer , Julio Deibis , won the first match , he said , " Although I have won the first game , the boxing ring is too narrow , and in fact made me feel uncomfortable . "

Xinhua News Agency , Shanghai , July 24 ( Correspondents Xu Shousong and Yu Lihong ) The correspondents learned from Guan Sheng Yuan ( Group ) Co . Ltd that exports of White Rabbit candy held up for a time at the Shanghai port have recently been resumed , and a considerable number of overseas agents have one after another increased their orders . 
Mr. Lim Cheng Eng of the Hock Lam company , Guan Sheng Yuan 's distributor in Singapore , recently called the Guan Sheng Yuan Group to say that since the result of a sample examination of White Rabbit candy by Singapore 's Agri - Food and Veterinary Authority showed that they did not contain formaldehyde and could be sold on the market normally , he wanted to place additional orders . 
Guan Sheng Yuan 's Malaysian distributor , the Feng Sheng company , said that it had asked Guan Sheng Yuan to immediately dispatch a container of the White Rabbit candy to Malaysia from Shanghai . 
Guan Sheng Yuan 's distributor in Hong Kong , Ng Fung Trading Co . Ltd , also phoned Guan Sheng Yuan to say that Hong Kong 's Center for Food Safety had taken random samples of White Rabbit candy from a Hong Kong supermarket and chemicals tests had confirmed that they do not contain formaldehyde . 
Ng Fung Trading Co . Ltd has received notification from Hong Kong 's China Resources Supermarket of its decision to resume sales of White Rabbit candy in its more than 100 stores in Hong Kong .

( International ) Man Suspected of Making Bomb Threats to a British Supermarket Is Arrested 
Xinhua News Agency , London , July 26 The British police announced on the 26th that a man suspected of making bomb threats to the British supermarket Tesco in mid - July was arrested on the 23rd in Clitheroe , Lancashire . 
The police said that this man , named Philip McHugh , is 51 years old and unemployed . He will be charged with blackmail and creating bomb scare . 
On the afternoon of July 14 ( Saturday ) , 14 branches nationwide of the supermarket Tesco in Britain were shut by the police as an emergency as a result of bomb threats , and were only able to resume their business on the following day . 
Saturday is the peak time for British people to go to the supermarket and do their shopping , and the closure of 14 supermarkets at that time caused Britain 's largest supermarket chain to lose millions of pounds of sales revenue . 
The British police carried out a criminal investigation into this bomb threat case soon afterwards and announced that they did not find any traces of terrorist activity in this case , but there were probably some economic motives behind it . 
( Sports ) Plants Change Season to Blossom " Out of Season " for the Beijing Olympic Games 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , July 28 ( Correspondent Cui Junqiang ) When the Olympic Games are held next year , Beijing is expected to turn into a sea of fresh flowers in hot and humid August . 
By season - altering and other technological methods , scientific and research personnel have found a good way of adding more color to the Olympic Games . 
At the " Practical Research into the Selection and Cultivation of New Plant Varieties for the Summer Olympics " project evaluation meeting held on the 28th in Beijing , the experts making the evaluation came to the conclusion that by the use of new rapid - control cultivation technologies , plant species or varieties with different natural flowering seasons could blossom at the same time in the summer and reach an optimum result for people to enjoy in August when the Beijing Olympics are held . 
In the summer in Beijing , one can usually see only a dozen or so fresh flowers in full bloom , as the majority of flowering plants have either long withered or are far away from blossoming . 
The scientific and research personnel worked hard to select 206 species and more than 400 varieties of plants for the Summer Olympic Games . 
At the " 2007 Olympic Games Plant and Flower Show " to be held in Beijing 's Haidian park around the one year countdown before the Beijing Olympics open , a batch of plants meticulously cultivated by scientific and research personnel that previously could not naturally flower in August will welcome visitors with their gaily - colored flowers . 
( International ) Turkey 's Ruling Party Wins Parliamentary Election 
Xinhua News Agency , Ankara , July 30 ( Correspondent Wang Jian ) The final results of the 23rd round of parliamentary election announced by Turkey 's Supreme Election Commission on the 30th show that the ruling Justice and Development Party won 341 of the 550 parliamentary seats , once again winning the right to form a single - party government .

The Turkish parliamentary election was originally scheduled to be held in November , but during the presidential election at the end of April the boycott of the opposition parties against the only candidate - - Deputy PrimeMinister and Foreign Minister Gul , who belongs to the Justice and Development Partyl - - led to the failure of the presidential elections , consequently bringing forward the parliamentary election . 
CCDI , I 'm Worried about the Effectiveness of Your " Anti - corruption Deadline " 
Posted by [ Guchanhuo ] at 2007-07-02 14:41:10 [ send a message ] [ full view ] 
On May 30 , the CCDI gave corrupt bribe - takers all over the country a time limit of one month , that is , by June 30 , if they have not voluntarily confessed before the deadline , it will catch them . 
As a man on the street , when I heard this , I couldn 't help laughing . When the police are catching thieves , do they tell the thieves a month in advance , hurry and voluntarily confess , otherwise we 'll catch you ? What kind of corruption fighting is that ? ? ? 
Isn 't this just the same as explicitly telling corrupt officials in advance to get running and quickly shift the incriminating evidence ? ? ? 
What 's the point in that ? 
It 'll definitely ... Oh , I simply don 't have the words . 
To look at it another way , even if it really does work , how effective will it be ? 
Will it be able to inhibit and deter corrupt officials ? 
We don 't exclude the possibility that there will be cowards among them who will come and voluntarily confess , but won 't there definitely be more who run ? 
And regardless of whether or not there has been a significant result when the CCDI 's anti - corruption deadline has arrived , but it might have served another purpose . 
That is that corrupt officials everywhere have all got the message and privately rejoice . They will all thank the CCDI . 
One month is enough time to quickly transfer your assets . 
If I were a corrupt official , I would absolutely be thinking this as well and I would absolutely not go to you to voluntarily declare them , either . 
Apart from celebrating their luck , corrupt officials will all be saying this : haha , thanks very much ... 
Ordinary people honestly can 't understand it at all , what 's with this corruption fighting ? Why is it so hard to just enforce it quickly and effectively , to take decisive action ? 
And will this kind of corruption fighting be of much use ? 
In summary , the CCDI , I 'm worried about the effectiveness of your " anti - corruption deadline . " 
Not Privatizing Land is the Bottom Line for My Reason and Calmness 
Posted by [ Duchi Monk ] at 2007-07-02 10:34:39 [ send a message ] [ full view ] 
Not Privatizing Land is the Bottom Line for My Reason and Calmness 
I think I 'm someone who doesn 't easily lose his temper . That 's my own feeling , at least . 
I 've always been reasonable and calm when posting on this forum . Very rare have been the occasions when I have lost my reason and talked nonsense . 
I 've also always had a great deal of trust and sincere expectations of the central Party . No matter how much their reform measures didn 't fit with my ideas , I could accept them all , and see this as one of their " characteristics . " 
But as soon as land starts to be privatized ( or covertly privatized ) , the existing basis of all this will be lost . 
It is better to lose a thousand soldiers than to give up an inch of land . Our national land resources are indeed our greatest social resources . 
The working people and the national land resources are the roots of a nation . 
If only the character of the national land resources doesn 't change , the character of the nation will not very easily alter . As soon as the character of the national land resources changes , then basically everything changes . 
I 'm not a member of the Communist Party , but I remember clearly that I have sworn this oath : " I love the motherland , I love the people ; I will study well and keep myself fit , to prepare for : contributing my effort to the cause of communism ! " 
" I will study diligently , work hard , put hard work before leisure , and struggle for the cause of communism ! " 
Those people who like me have sworn these oaths and have loudly sung , " We are the heirs of socialism , " should be able to remember the oaths they have made if they are not too shameless . 
If you have broken your own oath , then please honestly stand up and leave the side of " communism . " Don 't hoax the masses holding on to this placard , while thinking about how to sell the placard for a good price . 
Of course , I hope that all of these worries are needless . I hope that I will be able to maintain my reasonableness and calm always . 
You should remember , " We are the heirs of socialism . " 
If there 's nothing to inherit , what do we do then ? 
One Generation , Experience of Two Eras 
A while ago , someone asked : are there any thirty - year - old Mao supporters ? 
Later , it was changed to twenty - year - olds . 
Actually people of this age group didn 't experience the Mao Zedong era at all . I don 't know if the person who asked this question has had their brains washed away or if they were born dumb . 
In the cities , those with the most right to talk about the Mao Zedong era should be those who experienced those years for themselves . It 's the people who suffered the torments of + those years . That is to say , it should be people who were born between 1950 and 1960 . 
After they were born , their parents were taking part in campaigns and didn 't give their children the appropriate love . 
Just when they needed nutrition , they landed in three years of natural disaster and suffered the hardships of hunger . 
When they started school , again they met with the Cultural Revolution , and several years of their education were wasted . 
Some of them even terminated their education forever . When they were 15 - 17 years old , and had not finished their education , they were forced to abandon their studies and respond to the call of the Party to go into remote areas and villages and to reinforce the border areas . 
After they started work , they thought that the laboring class was the most honorable , so they voluntarily chose the dirtiest and hardest work . 
Their honor was short - lived ; their mediocrity stuck with them for a lifetime . 
When they were old enough to get married , getting married late , having children late and having only one child started with them . 
+ When they should have been getting + raises , the companies valued diplomas . Because they didn 't have diplomas , the + raises didn 't come . 
They worked hard to bring up their children and give their children a full basic education . When their children got into universities , they met with the double whammy of reform in the education system and reform of the state - owned enterprises . Tuition fees went up , and they were laid off . 
As their age increased day by day , they started to get ill , and again they were unlucky in meeting with the reform of the healthcare system . This meant that their diseased bodies couldn 't get treatment because they couldn 't pay the medical bills . 
We can see that all of the unfairness in society fell mercilessly on the people of their generation . 
But among these people there aren 't many who are against Mao Zedong or who attack Mao Zedong . 
Why ? 
They 're not Mao Zedong 's slaves . They 're flesh and blood , living right here among the people and groups of our society . The history of their personal experiences , from going to the remote areas and villages to being laid off from their jobs , encapsulates the social phenomena of two eras . 
Even though they are very unhappy about or even hate their wasted education , not having enough to eat , not having warm clothes , and some bad social phenomena during the Mao Zedong era , they still think the Mao Zedong era was good in terms of the national spirit , morality in personal relationships , and social practices 
The parents of some of you netizens are precisely people of this generation . You can chat about it with them .

" Injected Watermelons , " " Cancer Bananas , " and " Cardboard Buns " 
Posted by [ Wasteland Beyond the Great Wall ] at 2007-07-19 22:02:57 [ send a message ] [ full view ] I remember there was news two years ago of watermelons in Hainan being injected with chemical drugs by someone using a syringe . The result was that a load of Hainan watermelons rotted in the field , and a lot of watermelon farmers got no return on their expenses . 
CCTV later did a follow - up report , and it turned out that they proved there had never been any such thing . 
This report was weird from the beginning , because if you wanted to inject large watermelons with a syringe one by one , it would not only have no real point , it would also be impossible because of the amount of work . 
My memory from last year is clearer . There were reports in the media saying that banana trees in Hainan were suffering from a disease similar to human cancer , and that the diseased banana trees were very likely to die . 
The result was that it was misunderstood by lots of people to be that if you ate bananas you 'd get cancer . The result was the same again . The price of Hainan bananas dropped steeply , making the banana farmers cry till they had no more tears left and complain on and on . 
The reason why the two reports above both caused such a stir was because they directly touched on people 's most sensitive nerve , i.e . the issue of food safety . 
If the media says such - and - such a food may threaten our health , then it will definitely get relayed ten times , and those ten times relayed a hundred times . Towards the subject involved , people generally prefer to take an attitude of better to believe it than not . For a single person , eating a few less Hainan watermelons , bananas , etc. , is no big deal , after all . But for the producers and sellers of those products , the impact gets very big . 
Not long ago , another storm burst in Beijing over food safety . It was that people had gone so far as to use processed cardboard boxes as the filling when making buns because the price of pork had gone up . These were " cardboard buns . " 
When I heard this I was also deeply shocked . I thought these stallholders have an amazing ability to find new tricks , if they 've managed to think up this kind of method to cheat people . Moreover , I then passed on this piece of news to many people and warned my family and friends not to buy any more buns when they go out on the streets . 
But yesterday there was suddenly another piece of news saying that the cardboard buns report was fake news , and the whole thing was made up by one person . Now at the same time as I 'm feeling relieved I 'm also very puzzled . What on earth is with the media these days ? 
The facts of the matter that I 've found out from reliable sources are : a temporary employee of the program " Transparency " on the Beijing TV lifestyle channel , Zi something , took some pork filling himself that he 'd bought from the market , flour and cardboard , and instructed Wei someone and other people to soak the cardboard in water , mix it into the pork filling , and make it into buns . 
Zi something used a domestic digital video camera that he 'd taken to record the manufacturing process , then edited it and used tricks to get it broadcast . 
Now the police have already detained the criminal suspect Zi someone in accordance with the law , and will deal with him severely in accordance with the law . 
Since the bun incident occurred , the government has quickly organized the relevant departments to launch an investigation , and is conducting a thorough , comprehensive probe into Beijing 's breakfast market to guarantee safety on the public 's dining tables . 
Since the truth of the incident was confirmed , Beijing TV has made a public apology to the public and has learned an important lesson . It has investigated and dealt with the relevant responsible people severely , and will further strengthen management , stop up leak points , and resolutely put an end to false and untrue news reports . 
But even though the cardboard buns were pure fabrications , when everyone will dare to go again with confidence to the stalls to buy buns is as yet an unknown . 
This incident also reflects from one perspective the importance that the government places on food safety and the speed of its action . And to an extent it also shows that the dining tables of the Beijing public are still fairly safe . The false alarm of the bun incident has also been a reminder for everyone ! 
To Whom Do We Owe a Duty in Education ? 
Recently I 've heard friends back home talking about some news from a school , and I have to have my say about this . 
It all happened at a private middle school in Shanghai - South West Weiyu Middle School . 
The school decided to arrange the best teachers for three classes of students from the school 's own junior middle school who had signed contracts on direct admission to the senior middle school . And it got some young teachers with unimpressive teaching records and no experience of teaching high school seniors to teach some other classes which had been admitted from other schools after examination or had not signed contracts for admission to this school . 
The reason was : the students who signed contracts agreed at that time not to take the examinations for other senior middle schools , so the school must guarantee the best teachers for them according to the agreement . 
And the school 's attitude to the students in other classes was : you should give young teachers the opportunity to gain experience . 
This couldn 't but make me wonder , to whom do we really owe a duty in education ? 
I remember when I studied at a key senior middle school many years ago , all of the students in my class were unhappy with the quality of one math teacher 's teaching . Despite the complexity of things , we collectively signed a request that the school change our teacher . 
In the end , the school really did give us another teacher , because the school 's promise to us was that it would treat every student equally , that it would do its duty by every student . 
Ten years ago I came to the US to study for a postgraduate degree . 
One summer , when I was choosing my courses for the next semester , I found that all the elective courses the department had arranged were all heavily theoretical courses , and they hadn 't arranged any of some more practical courses . 
I went to talk to the head of the department and told him I thought there was a problem with the curriculum . 
The head of the department admitted that the reason the curriculum did not include any practical courses was because of a lack of teachers . In one or two years when they had teachers , they would be able to offer them . 
I remember I said to him then : " This is your problem , not mine . 
The reason I came halfway round the world from Shanghai to study at this school was because I was attracted by the introduction of your curriculum . 
If you can 't offer these courses , then don 't put them in the introduction , otherwise it 's false advertising . It 's failing to do your duty by me and my family . " 
After listening to what I said , the department head thought for a while and then said , Well , I 'll see what we can do to solve this . 
It may be already too late , because all of the courses have already been arranged and registered online . 
Three weeks later , the head of department came to talk to me , basically to tell me that his work was to take care of every student , including me . 
He had listened to my advice and made his best efforts . He had added two practical electives , and hoped I could understand . 
After this happened , I took a few courses taught by the head of department . 
He never showed any bias against me because I 'd complained to him . In every class he very fairly gave me an A. 
The night before graduation , I heard his secretary say that he did everything he could for every student , but not all the students were grateful to him . 
During the graduation ceremony , when I was making a speech on behalf of the honors students , I told the head of department : all of us in our hearts appreciated everything he 'd done for us , because he had done all he could to do his duty by everyone of us . 
I felt that I had made the right choice in life by coming to this school . 
As I said this , I saw a glint of tears in the department head 's eyes ... If one day every education worker in China and the whole education system can do their duty by every single student , then I think China 's golden age won 't be far away . 
Central NY Men 's 4s Volleyball Tournament 
Last Sunday I took part in the Central NY Men 's 4s Volleyball Tournament . I played for six and a half hours , and in the end our team won the championship . 
This tournament was actually a warm - up tournament organized as preparation for taking part in the volleyball tournament at the summer sports games in New York ( Empire State Games ) . 
The coach split up Central NY 's four participating men 's teams ( the high - school team , the college team , the over-35s team and the over-45s team ) and rearranged them into four - person teams , with a setter in each team , and started the matches . 
The tournament rules were a lot of fun . You could only do back row attacks , you couldn 't dink the ball inside the three - meter line , only one setter was allowed to block , and there were no substitutions . 
So basically it was a test of spiking power and judgment and blocking in defense . 
Our team had a 2m opposite hitter , who was both our strongest man and our tallest man in attack . He took care of 60 % of our attacks and points in the tournament . One 1.85 m setter solo blocked at the net and roofed a lot of attacks . 
A 1.90 m middle hitter made quite a few mistakes in attack because he was in the back row . 
And then there was me , a 1.75 m spiker , making the occasional sneak attack , with a quite acceptable success rate . I mainly received the other team 's cross - court spikes . 
There were seven teams in total . First was a round robin . After my team won one match , the referee kept judging that our opposite hitter had fouled by stepping on the line while spiking . This had a big impact on our morale , and in no time we 'd lost three matches in a row . 
But after we 'd lost , everyone calmed down , and our teamwork also came together during these three matches , so we started a winning streak . 
After the round robin , my team had won three , lost three . Because of our low scores , we were in 6th position . 
Then we started the playoffs . Apart from the team in first place , all the teams placed 2 through 7 played against one another in the elimination round . 
Our team was psychologically and tactically settled , so we played hard and took no prisoners . We led all the way and got into the semi - finals . 
Our opponents in the semi - finals were good in attack but weak in defense . My arms got beaten black and blue , but when I did manage to save a hard spike , the level of satisfaction was twice that I got by scoring from spiking the ball myself . 
I didn 't even know what the final score was when we won . 
The opponents in the final had balanced attack and defense . Our serves broke a lot of their attacks , and we led from the beginning . 
Finally we had match point at 21 - 24 , and our opponents made two serves in a row that I couldn 't control . At 23 - 24 our opposite hitter came over and said to me , it doesn 't matter , it 's only two shots . 
The next shot came flying at me again , but it was okay , I passed it quite well , the setter back - passed it to the opposite hitter , and a hard spike finished the competition . 
Another Thing about Morality 
I 've already said a lot about morality for isolated free individuals . 
On this subject I haven 't got anything worth repeating . 
What I want to say now concerns groups . 
We often meet situations that require groups . 
In these situations , there is a need for groups to have some morality . 
We can often find some very good morals in groups that have achieved success . 
This is no coincidence . 
Because for these causes or activities , we need to overcome some of the difficulties before us , to pull together , rid ourselves of those elements based on faith . I think it 's those good morals that also play a role that can 't be ignored . 
At the very least , a group of people with very low moral standards will find it very difficult to complete any successful major project together . This can be predicted with great confidence . 
Perhaps it is because the wisdom that enables one to see the long term interests with reasoned and forward vision is a necessary quality for success in a group . 
In reality , groups often use all kinds of methods to obtain an identity , for example , logos , jargon , beliefs , etc. etc. , and also morality . 
Only if you have ros ¨ ¦ in the morning and ros ¨ ¦ in the evening will your life be a bed of roses . 
[ Discussion ] How Many Times in Your Life Have You Been Truly Happy ? 
A good friend of mine from senior middle school has finally got her visa and will set out at the end of August for a top school on the west coast of the USA to study for a postgraduate degree . 
Today a few people from my school got together , and we were truly glad for her . At last she 'd got what she wanted . 
Seeing her so happy , I was really envious . 
I thought , I 'm all grown up , but I 've only been that happy the time I passed my exams to get into senior middle school . At the time I 'd never thought I 'd be able to get into the well - known school ranked first or second in the entire city . Later , I went predictably on to go to college and get a job . In all that time I was never so happy again . 
When I passed the exams to get into college , it wasn 't the one I 'd aimed for before , so you couldn 't say I was particularly happy . 
During my time at college , the only thing that kept me going was that after graduating I could go up north and get together with a guy who I 'd been in love with for two years . 
But fate always intervenes , and a month before I graduated , he broke up with me . All of my fantasies from before collapsed . 
Later I just went back to the north to work . Now I 've been working for nearly two years , and I 've made enough money for a mid - range car , but I haven 't ever felt that happy again . 
Chatting with my good friend today , I was really able to feel her happiness . Having slaved in preparation for a year , beside herself with worry , she has finally succeeded in getting abroad , and is going to start a new life . That feeling of a dream coming true really makes one very happy . 
I haven 't planned to carry on studying , and I don 't like living overseas either , because I worked overseas for half a year before , and found that life abroad doesn 't actually suit me . 
Having seen how happy my friend was , I couldn 't help thinking , what are my goals ? 
What can make me that happy again ? 
Perhaps it 's finding someone who really loves me , and is willing to stay with me for the rest of our lives . 
I think at that time I 'll be excited enough to cry , just as my good friend said to me , when she passed the embassy interview and got her clearance certificate , she couldn 't stop herself crying . A year of hard work and worry had finally been rewarded . 
And me ? 
In relationships , I 've given the most meticulous care , putting my heart into it over and over . When will I also get what I want , and cry for happiness ? 
Perhaps I 'm just a loser . I 've never worried about my career , but what about my love life ? 
When will my love life sort itself out ? 
I 've always felt down on this issue . 
What about you , all you boys and girls ? 
How many times in your lives have you been truly happy ? 
A Big Advertisement for the School of Architecture , South East University 
Haha , and this also counts as letting SEU alumni know what 's going on at the School of Architecture . 
The latest first - hand news , plus my own comments - - Refund guaranteed if it 's fake . 
Dean Wang , Secretary An , Professor Li of the personnel office , as well as several other lecturers from the architectural technology and science teaching and research office , attended the presentation . I talked for an hour , and then everyone discussed it for about an hour and a half . 
After the official presentation finished , Professor Zhang ( assistant to the dean of the school ) pulled me aside and said to me , let 's go into the back office , shut the door and have a talk . 
He was extremely friendly . He closed the door and told me that at formal meetings there are some things that it 's better not to say . He said that it was clear that I had no basic idea about my future income , and then told me some specifics about the incomes of lecturers at the School of Architecture to stop me worrying . 
Dean Wang had given an overview of the School of Architecture before the presentation . He said that there were six key architecture - related programs in total across the country . There are two at SEU , two at Tsinghua , one at Tongji , and one at Tianjin Univ . There are none apart from these . 
He said that in the past few years the State has laid a special emphasis on conserving energy resources in building , " green " architecture , and architectural science and technology , and that SEU wanted to bring in a lecturer in this area . 
He said they 'd received over 20 resumes that came in one after another , applying for this position . There were locals , there were Japanese , there were Americans ( apparently just one : me ) . 
The School of Architecture saw this as very important , and examined the applicants very carefully . 
Compared with some of the other architecture schools in colleges that I know , SEU really is pretty cutting edge . Tongji 's urban planning is probably a shade better than SEU , but it seems that SEU may still be a little ahead in terms of architectural design ( This is something I hadn 't realized before . ) 
Dean Wang said that in the last two years the School of Architecture 's funding had been more than adequate . It was one of the key schools being developed in the National 985 Project . 
He told me that last year , the government gave lump - sum funding of 10 million in development expenses to the SEU SoA . Of this , 3.5 million was spent directly on buying books to enrich the School of Architecture 's specialist library ( haha , even I want to give a big thumbs up to this : a generous deed ! 
) . The rest of it was almost all used buying equipment for experiments in my field . 
It 's said that this aroused complaints from several Academicians . 
Haha - by the way , I think they seem to have been ripped off on some imported equipment . 
There 's one test system for measuring how airtight a room is . In America it 's very common . I reckon you could definitely get it for 500 US dollars . But it turns out that SEU spent 50,000 renminbi on it ! ! ! 
There 's some other things , too . A lot of colleges and departments at SEU have now moved to the new campus at Jiulong Lake , but the School of Architecture insists on staying . It says it wants to give the students a good architectural environment . The old campus still has some classic architecture for them to see , whereas the new campus doesn 't have anything . 
Haha - It seems like the School of Architecture has also requested and obtained another building because the other departments have all moved out . 
So Dean Wang said straight out to me that in future he would be able to give me my own office . 
I 'm extremely embarrassed : when Dean Wang said this , I didn 't have even the slightest reaction . 
Later , Professor Zhang pulled me aside and told me that this was not easy to get , because offices were in extremely short supply . Some of the senior professors didn 't even have their own offices . 
This made me feel very unsettled . It seems I still don 't , ah , understand the situation in this country . 
Overall , I 've had a very pleasant trip to SEU . The senior faculty and connected lecturers at the SEU School of Architecture have shown themselves to be extremely professional and hospitable , and have made a very good impression on me . 
I hope everything goes well for SEU in its development , and may the School of Architecture continue to maintain its leading position ! 
The Qinhuai River by the shade of lights and the splash of oars 
Even the Finest Feast Must Break up at Last 
Two weeks ago I had lunch with my colleagues to say goodbye to our former boss . 
This boss is really worthy of the name high - flying woman . She is extremely good to her subordinates like us , and we gladly worked for her , even doing overtime in the evenings and on weekends . This is not common among Americans . She can also be considered the best boss I 've ever worked for . 
She has left the company and started a math tutorial class for elementary school and middle school students because she wants to look after her family and have more time to teach her kids . 
I 'm sure she will succeed whatever she does ! 
Taking Her Love to Africa , Stephanie Sun Runs into a Sandstorm , Gets thrown at with a Stone , and Suffers Scratches ( Pictures ) 
Caring for sick children . 
Showing off " mouse muscles . " 
With World Vision , for the second time Stephanie Sun has gone on in Africa from Congo to Niger . 
At a press conference yesterday , she admitted frankly that it was the most tiring journey she had ever made . 
The weather in that area is scorching , the drinking water dirty , and when she visited a market she encountered people at a protest angrily throwing stones . Even riding on a camel she was scratched by the saddle . 
Throughout the journey there was mishap after mishap , making her scream to herself several times , " I really want to go home ! " 
Shock at seeing the children 's malnutrition 
Having taken part in World Vision 's campaigns to care for poor children for the past three consecutive years , Stephanie Sun calls herself an experienced spokesperson . 
She took 30 bottles of vitamins , 40 flashlights , and 500 sweets to share with the local children . 
She said that having accumulated a lot of experience , she knew that no matter how many little gifts she took , they would never be enough . 
In Niger , the most serious problem is that mothers have no understanding of the issues involved in child raising , so the children suffer from serious malnutrition . 
On the eight - hour car journey from the capital of Niger to the small town of Dara 500 kilometers away , Stephanie Sun experienced a sandstorm rarely seen in the area . 
The wind blew sand and brought rain , and the whole sky changed colors with the wind and clouds . 
The Jeep they were riding in shook more and more in the wind . 
Recalling that moment , Stephanie Sun shuddered at the memory , revealing that even though she was in the car , she was very afraid . 
She only relaxed a little when she later heard local people explaining that the sandstorm was a sign of good luck , bringing rain and moisture to the soil . 
With local residents . 
Pained by mothers ' problems raising children 
When she arrived at Dara , local officials held a dromedary welcome ceremony and invited Stephanie Sun to sit on the camel and be cheered by the local people . 
But the camel was scared by the flashes and got completely out of control , nearly throwing Stephanie Sun to the ground . 
Finally Stephanie Sun jumped down herself , but her clothes were accidentally got ripped by a hook on the saddle which scratched her arm , leaving a small bloody streak about eight centimeters long . 
On this trip , Stephanie Sun visited four sick local children with severe malnourishment . One of them was a baby four months old , weighing just 2.1 kilograms . It didn 't look like a person at all . 
She said : " When I saw him , my heart ached . His condition was really so extreme . But it must also be the mother 's problem . We should teach them correct ideas about nutrition . " 
The Key to Chinese Education - Humanize It 
Key words : the key to Chinese education - humanize it , the key to Chinese education - humanize it 
The goal of education is : to make the educated more able to live in and enjoy the existing social environment . 
" Live " everyone can easily understand , but perhaps everyone has just understood " enjoy " as simply " have fun . " Actually , that 's not right . The scope of " enjoy " here is very broad . 
Live : this includes the strengthening of the body and the strengthening of the mind . 
1 . Strengthening of the body : through various forms of physical % pw , increase + physical strength , improve coordination , bring about steady improvement in sporting ability , so that you can meet the need for sufficient physical exercise and the needs of engaging with society . 
2 . Strengthening of the mind : to be able to recognize more clearly the society in which you find yourself , to know yourself , to learn to engage with other people , to learn the ability to adapt yourself as you live and to experience and enjoy . 
Above I 've explained the goals of education , but the connection with this essay isn 't very strong . Now I 'll talk about the key point : the key to Chinese education - humanize it 
The essence of humanization is : fully understanding the differences among individuals whom you cannot treat the same . 
Club Original Writing : a Few Common Stages in Learning about Buffett 
Club original writing : a few common stages in learning about Buffett : I 'm Strolling 
1 ) Stage one : introduction to Buffett . You have a feeling of finally finding what you 've been looking for , and immediately apply it in real life , but at this time your understanding of Buffett 's ideas is not deep , not thorough . Very often you 'll make a lot of mistakes in using them , apply them incorrectly , and apply them blindly , so the results will be patchy . 
2 ) Stage two : " surpassing " Buffett . After a period of learning and practice , almost every " intelligent person " is thinking about a few questions : for example , what should a Buffett with Chinese characteristics be like ? 
Does Buffett 's theory need to be applied flexibly in China ? 
Can I do even better than Buffett ? 
So the main features of this stage are overconfidence and blind arrogance , looking for a Buffett theory with Chinese characteristics . 
After a period of application , the results will generally still be patchy and inconsistent . If your luck is good , it 's better to have some losses and quickly return to the mainstream . 
3 ) Stage three : you return to Buffett . After a few wrong turns , you are finally able to realize that + you are an ordinary person , not a genius . 
You should demand a little less of yourself . Making a solid study of Buffett is more than enough . 
The simplest turns out to be the most effective . But the simple methods often include very deep thinking , and you must understand this thinking before you can better apply the simple through to the end . 
The characteristics of this stage are results that are not substantial in the short term , but plentiful in the long term , and consistent . 
Stage four : " inflexible " Buffett . Having achieved consistent results , in this stage you are basically inflexible with regard to Buffett 's theories . You take no notice at all of companies other than Buffett 's . 
You go on learning and deepening your understanding of Buffett and applying it in real life . The characteristics of this stage are ever - improving results , consistency , and entering into a virtuous spiral . 
The time that each person need for each stage varies . It depends on both your personal situation and your luck . 
A Devout Buddhist ( 236553903 ) 14:18:05 
He is one of my old net friends . He posted this story in the group . 
I 'd rather write this story in this section . 
I hope everyone reads this article . I have no expectation that it will be the so - called top pick , but sometimes there are some things , some truths , that you can understand and learn from a pithy little story . 
This is a story that makes you feel very cold when you 've finished reading it . 
I really hope this really is just a story ... because I really do feel bad ... 
On a highway in the mountain three bandits with guns spotted a pretty woman driver . They forced the mid - sized bus to stop and tried to take the woman driver off the bus for some fun . The woman driver desperately cried for help , but all the passengers on the bus were too scared to move . 
Just one scrawny middle - aged man responded and went to fight with them , but he was knocked to the ground and suffered injuries . 
The man got really angry , vigorously shouting to everyone on the bus to stop the assault , but nobody responded , allowing the woman driver to be dragged into the bushes in the mountain . 
Half an hour later , the three bandits returned with the woman driver , whose clothes were disheveled . 
The bus was going to start again . The woman driver told the scrawny man , who had been hurt and was bleeding , to get off the bus . 
The man refused , and became argumentative . 
Hey , get off the bus ! My bus won 't take you . 
The middle - aged man became desperate and said : Why are you being so unreasonable ? Was I wrong to try to save you ? 
You save me ? 
What did you save me from ? 
The woman driver flatly dismissed him , and a few passengers sniggered . 
The middle - aged man got really angry , and cursed himself for not having the strength of a superhero . 
But even if he hadn 't succeeded in saving anyone , he didn 't deserve to be turned out of the bus like this as a result . He firmly refused to get off . 
For another thing , I 've bought a ticket . I have a right to stay on the bus ! 
The driver turned away from him and said coldly : If you don 't get off the bus , I 'm not driving . 
Unexpectedly , all of the passengers on the bus who had just ignored the assault seemed to have just woken up and jointly told the man to get off the bus : Quickly , get off the bus . We 've got things to do , we can 't wait . 
A few strong passengers even wanted to come forward and drag the middle - aged man off the bus . It was enough to make you think of the story from " Boule de Suif " by Maupassant . 
The three bandits were grinning , laughing with satisfaction . 
One of them , a dark - skinned thug with no principles , said shamelessly : Us guys did everything we wanted with her ! 
The two other bandits also started talking trash : She 's my girlfriend , it 's got damn - all to do with you ! 
There was uproar , until the man 's luggage was thrown out of the window of the bus , and then he was shoved out . 
The bus once again drove steadily along the mountain road . The woman driver arranged her hair , and turned on the recorder . 
The bus had nearly reached the top of a hill . When it had gone around this turn it would start going down . To the left of the bus was the road blasted out of the hillside . On the right was a cliff hundreds of feet high . 
The bus quietly picked up speed . The woman driver 's face was completely composed , her two hands holding the steering wheel tightly , tears glittering in her eyes . 
One of the bandits seemed to sense something and said : Slow down , slow down , what the fuck are you trying to do ? 
The woman driver didn 't say anything , and the bus went faster and faster . 
The bandit tried to run forward and grab the steering wheel , but the bus sped towards the cliff like an arrow from a bow ... 
The next day the local newspapers reported : A tragedy occurred yesterday in Fuhu Mountain area . A mid - sized bus fell off a cliff . 
There were no survivors among the driver and 13 passengers . 
When the middle - aged man who had been thrown off the bus along the way saw the newspaper , he cried . 
No - one knew what he was crying for , or why he cried . 
Darkness at the Railroad Station 
Recently I was away from home for a few days . I took the train , and discovered the nastiness of railway stations everywhere during the summer high season . 
I wanted to understand more about what we should be aware of at railroad stations in various places . 
I 'm from Changsha , so I 'll first say a bit about the situation in Changsha . Everyone should be aware of this when they come to Changsha ! 
1 . Train tickets are always difficult to buy . At Changsha railroad station , at every major holiday or the beginning and end of the summer and winter school vacation , you have absolutely no chance of getting a ticket . However early you go , queuing up is useless . 
The best answer I 've received when I asked is that the travel agencies book up all the tickets . 
But with the ticket touts , you can pay a bit extra and have as many as you want . 
2 . Watch out for fake tickets . The tickets that the touts have are not necessarily real . Shuangfeng and Xinhua in Hunan make their money , one from fake certificates and one from fake coins , so fake tickets is really just child 's play ! 
Amending tickets is the most basic . Some tickets look so real that even the train attendants can 't tell the difference . 
3 . Who touched my money ? When buying things at stores at railroad stations , you absolutely must be careful ! 
If you want to give them small bills , haha , your bills are always missing a corner , so you have to use a large bill instead . 
But when you give a large bill instead , once the store owner has got his hands on it , he will definitely say he can 't change it , give it back to you and ask for those small bills with the missing corners again . At this point all you can do is take back a fake large bill ! 
4 . Change from a magician . Not every store owner will swap your big bills . That 's a crime , and the risks are pretty big ! 
So some " cowardly " store owners have to be magicians . You clearly see that your change is right when they count it , but when you have a chance to count it yourself , haha ! It 's short by a few bills . 
5 . Imported drinks everywhere . There aren 't that many cafes at the railroad station , but if you go in one you 'll understand . 
A few glasses of rough red wine are sold at the price of Martell . If you don 't pay ... then even your mother might not recognize you . 
6 . Roses and guns . There are a lot of video booths around the railroad station . The titles of the films showing are very attractive to us common men , so if you go in and watch , you 'll be surely taken to be a distinguished guest who wants a little relaxation . So a flower girl will come along straight away to keep you company . Of course , you need to have enough money for a five - star hotel consumption , otherwise those big knives aren 't always used for fighting foreign devils ! 
7 . Ice and fire . If you 've got a Changsha accent or you know Changsha very well , then don 't ever think about getting a taxi in the square in front of the railroad station . The face on the taxi driver will make you understand what a snowstorm in June really is ! 
But if this is your first time in Changsha , then congratulations ! Never mind that you are going somewhere five minutes ' walk away , the driver will still be glad to take you to enjoy the sights of this national - level key tourism city , and will also let you breathe a lungful of secondhand smoke from the famous White Sand brand and have a smell that it is loaded with the local specialty - betel flavoring . 
Of course , you have to pay for the transport yourself , don 't you ? 
Nanjing Metro Drivers Should Get Psychotherapy ASAP 
Key word : Psychotherapy 
According to a report from Xinhua News Agency , there was a suicide on the tracks in the Nanjing metro on the evening of July 3 . 
According to what the reporter says , " Zhu Zhengting , 22 , is a young metro driver . He had a nightmarish experience . When this reporter saw him yesterday , he seemed not to have recovered from his horror . He was sitting very straight up in his chair , and his eyes also looked a little glazed . " 
Obviously , this young driver 's nerves had received a big shock , and he urgently needed to get some psychotherapy , otherwise it would affect him for the rest of his life . 
I don 't know if everyone remembers the emergency rescue guy who saved a little girl in an abandoned oil well in the US + state of Texas over a decade ago . After suffering long - term psychological torture , he eventually chose to kill himself and ended his painful life . 
Even though he had had basic psychotherapy at the time , people focused more on the little girl who had been rescued and overlooked precisely the one person who needed psychotherapy more . In the end , they failed to prevent this tragedy from happening . 
In the same way , in the Dover Straits illegal immigration case a few years ago , it was said that the first British policeman to open the container went into shock right there . 
Afterwards the British authorities gave him over two months of psychotherapy before he got back to normal . 
When people suffer a catastrophic shock , their minds are wounded very seriously . At this time , if you rely only on your own resources it 's very difficult to make a full recovery , and often psychological scars will be left . 
Since these scars are very difficult for others to find , and if they do find them , there 's nothing they can do , many people involved in incidents will be in pain for the rest of their lives . 
However , in our country people don 't care enough about psychological wounds , particularly the families or employers of the people involved often think of it only after they 've missed the best window for recovery . Then it 's already too late . 
Now that there is more diversity in the broadcast media , we often hear about shocking things . A lot of young women get hurt , and a lot of young children see their own parents suffer terrible injuries . 
After these young people have been rescued , we very rarely hear that they have received psychological treatment . More often they are consoled by the love of their relatives . 
Although the victims can feel that they are now safe , the past harm becomes a scar that can never be removed and can be inflamed at any time . This affects the life of the person involved . 
We can be grateful that this driver 's superiors quickly calmed him down , and were able to ease his psychological stress . 
Ultimately , the driver was not to blame for the accident , and the driver took measures when he discovered the situation . He had done what he should have done , but just hadn 't stopped the tragedy from happening . 
I 'm sure anyone there would have been shocked by the accident that happened on the scene , even if they weren 't the driver involved . 
But other people didn 't have any connection with the suicide . Even if they were shocked , they would gradually forget as time went by . 
But the driver involved isn 't that lucky . He has to remember , and very likely will remember it all his life . 
If he can free himself from this , then he 's lucky . If he can 't free himself from it , then he 'll often be tortured by this kind of shock . 
The modern conception of health is much more comprehensive than in the past . Psychological health is starting to be noticed by people . 
The pity is that the psychological condition of humanity is very depressing . Particularly in the cities , people 's psychological health is not at all what it should be . Many people have psychological problems to a greater or lesser extent , and some people are not able to get enough attention when they encounter problems . 
Think of the lessons of the Yang Lijuan incident a while back . Some irresponsible news outlets turned a sick person tormented by psychological problems into the subject of media hype , causing very bad impact on our society . 
In the future we should avoid this kind of thing happening , otherwise our society really will turn into a sick society . 
Five Teachers at Dongkou No. 5 Middle School Feel Overwhelmed after the First Period of Training in the New Syllabus 
Key Words : Dongkou No. 5 Middle School , teacher 's first period , new syllabus % pw Five teachers from Dongkou No. 5 Middle School Feel Overwhelmed after the First Period of Training in the New Syllabus From the morning of July 13 to the 15th , the first group of teachers from Dongkou No. 5 Middle School to take the training for the new syllabus got a real taste of the pressure and the motivation from the new syllabus . 
At the same time , they also feel that the syllabus reform is a rare opportunity and challenge for the development of teaching at the school . 
On the morning of the 13th , because roadwork on the stretch of road from Shijiang in Dongkou to Longhui had caused a traffic jam , it was already past 1:00 p.m. by the time the teachers from Dongkou No. 5 Middle School and teachers from Suining and other places made it to the municipal education bureau . The staff at the education bureau , who had long worked beyond their midday break , % pw still got the training materials that they had loaded into cars out of the cars again and did the necessary paperwork for us , and we got our training materials . 
At 2.30 p.m . , the travel - weary teachers again braved the scorching heat and separately entered the multimedia classrooms at Municipal No. 1 Middle School , Municipal No. 2 Middle School and Municipal No. 6 Middle School to listen to lectures by the relevant experts . 
Over the next two days , the teachers listened to lectures by the editors of the teaching materials or listened to lessons learned from the experiences of teachers in provinces which had already started the new syllabus reform . Some of the educational researchers or teachers who had attended province - level training in the new syllabus also talked about their experiences and what they had learned . 
On the morning of the 15th , after finishing all of the training courses , we then went through assessment . The five teachers from Dongkou No. 5 Middle School had studied hard and never came in late or left earlier , so they passed the assessment easily , and all received a certificate of course completion . 
During the training period , the Dongkou No. 5 Middle School teachers talked among themselves . At first we all felt that the new syllabus was rather unfamiliar , that this was a difficult task , that there was a lot of pressure , and that it was difficult to understand . 
But after the training was finished , everyone thought that this was also an opportunity and a challenge . 
We are all determined to work at adjusting the structure of our knowledge and complete the task of syllabus reform as satisfactorily as possible . 
The second group of teachers to attend the new syllabus training arrived at the relevant location for training on the 16th .

Happy to Make Friends with Fans of Celebrities 
Key Words : fans of celebrities 
I have a female friend whom I 've never seen . 
I said straight out to her , I really admire you ! 
Because you express your love candidly . 
She likes a male host of a popular entertainment program in Taiwan , and has never hidden her feelings . 
When this male host hosts a program in Jinan , she flies to Jinan ; when this male host goes to Changsha to do a guest appearance , she flies to Changsha . 
The male host says in his book that a friend gave him a slingshot with no shot . Pleasantly surprised , she told me , " I gave him that slingshot . " 
She also helps to do an online magazine about this star . Every issue she excitedly reads it with me . 
I 've always really liked talking with some people who frankly admit that they are a fan of such - and - such a celebrity . 
These celebrities can be movie stars , can be sports stars , and of course can also be great figures . 
I 've never thought that these friends are shallow . I think they 're very lovely . 
These people are usually straightforward people . If they like someone , they like someone , if they don 't like someone , they don 't like them . 
Getting along with this kind of people can be very easy . 
Although they won 't think 100 % about your feelings , you at least know what makes them tick . You also know that you will feel more secure if you spend time with them . 
These people are also very honest . 
You should know that it also takes courage to dare to express your likings . 
It 's precisely because of this that a lot of people just secretly like a person their entire life , or they might even look down a little on those people who barefacedly say they are a fan of so - and - so . 
I think honesty is a person 's greatest strong point , being honest with friends and being honest with yourself . 
But it is actually very hard to do that . 
If one can love a celebrity , it also proves that a part of his heart is selfless . 
Some of my friends are fans of celebrities . 
Sometimes they can go through a lot of hardship to get a look at this celebrity . They can sacrifice many things , tighten their belts and scrimp and save , holding a placard in their left hand and pressing a camera button with their right , while shouting on and on . 
You could say they are very silly or childish , but it takes selflessness to love someone without looking for anything in return . 
Because in reality , there are far too many who love themselves , think they 're great , and think little of other people . So this bit of selflessness seems to be quite precious . 
So when everyone starts chatting and saying that the celebrity they like is so - and - so , if someone says , I 've never made anyone my idol ... 
Haha , then you should watch out . 
Teresa Cheung the Person 
Key words : Teresa Cheung 
By chance I had an opportunity to see an episode of " Kangxi Come " that I hadn 't seen for a long time . The main guest was Teresa Cheung . 
Thinking back , it was when she was promoting " Color Blossoms . " 
The time when I saw " Colour Blossoms " was the days when I was mad about erotic movies . 
At the time I thought it was extraordinary that sex movies could be filmed in such an esthetic way . Sometimes they were also really interesting and were called erotic movies . 
Actually , I haven 't seen many erotic movies , but they cover quite a lot of countries . 
The first ones I saw were from Korea and Japan . 
Later I also saw quite a lot from third world countries and some from Latin America and Europe . But I didn 't see many Hollywood or French movies . 
I couldn 't bear to delete two of them from my computer . One is " Plum Blossom , " and the other is just " Color Blossoms . " 
The first half of " Color Blossoms " is quite good . They are all first - timers and act very energetically . The direction is also very measured . 
Then in the second half it 's a bit perverted , I can 't take it at all . 
Actually , what I want to say is that Teresa Cheung said on the program that her boyfriends have included those of almost every nationality in the world , except for Africans . 
At present , she has four boyfriends . 
On this issue , I 'm afraid the average person would find it unacceptable and would say this person is a slut . 
But the key point in this issue is that she was very honest when she was talking about these issues . There wasn 't a hint of an expression that would make people uncomfortable . 
She also talked about her view of love . 
For example , both parties should keep their money separate . 
I guess their identities should also be independent . Each one controls their own fate . 
Because I know that for people who are in love , love is alive , is selfish . How could it allow the person you love to accept the love of another person at the same time ? 
Going by my experience and guesswork , most likely Teresa Cheung 's love is no longer a simple entanglement . She must be going for the classic relationship with a younger man . 
In a relationship with a younger man , the older woman can accommodate anything , including having several toyboys at the same time . At the same time , the younger man can attach himself without reservation to the older woman because of her attractiveness and maternal nature , but maybe doesn 't mind whether he is the only one , etc. , etc. 
But I also felt from what Teresa Cheung said that she is someone who really knows how to enjoy life . 
For example , she is + crazily passionate about travel . 
So I also have reason to believe that her life is also very exciting . 
If it was the past me , I 'm afraid I would still not be able to accept this kind of thing . 
Just like now , I 've come to accept a lot of people . Actually , this hasn 't got that much to do with tolerance or intolerance , it 's just about thinking it over in your own mind , then there are no absolute loves or hates . 
These people , like passer - by A , friend B , Zhang Ziyi , good friend C , and Sister Lotus . 
Looking at other people 's lives , I am an onlooker , so to other people , mustn 't I also be the main character in my own life ? 
It 's just like , even though I 'm not in Jianghu , there are always stories about me in Jianghu . 
People Always Need a Spice of Entertainment 
Key words : spice of entertainment 
For people , life is a tiring thing , so it 's best if we have a spice of entertainment . 
Either laughing at ourselves or watching jokes from the people around us , gossiping about other people . 
For example , just going to the Tianya " Celebrity Gossip " board for a bit of relaxation . 
In there , everyone says whatever they want , but you should of course have a bit of ability to distinguish between right and wrong , because there 's all kinds of " trickery . " 
The results of " say what you want " are that you don 't even know what you 're saying yourself , but you want to be clear what it is you 're reading . 
Little S calls Tsai Kang - yung a " scholar . " 
If I also count as one , then it 's the kind who has read some books , but hasn 't yet really grasped them . 
At least I always know my own shortcomings . 
But , the + good thing is that I got a few things that I myself wanted to get when I did this bit of reading . 
It also happens that I like just pondering over things , too . So I was pondering and reading at the same time , but I got quite a few ideas clear . A lot of things clicked into place . 
So , gradually I got into some habits , like telling myself to be a bit harder on myself and a bit better to other people . 
When running into a problem with some matter , first look for the cause in yourself . 
Use your head in the way you do things and follow your heart in dealing with relationships . 
Keep a low profile and do things in a low key . 
But , you know , not all people are that nice . They 'll always be selfish , and always think about their own gains and losses . There 'll always be times when they should be using their heads , but they follow their hearts into a big mess , and times when they should be following their hearts , but they 're still using f**king logic like there 's no tomorrow . 
But at least there is a good side : I never regret the choices I 've made . 
If I 've done it then I 've done it ; if I 've messed up , then I live with it . 
What 's the point in thinking about all that useless stuff ? 
At least I 'm not one of those people who likes to be all po - faced and puff myself up as a scholar . I 'm just an ordinary person , too . 
Where I 'm different from other people is just that I don 't have to be cynical . I 'm a bit more reasonable in dealing with matters in general . 
Or , for example , my trust is particularly strong . 
Once I trust someone , then I 'll think that everything about him is good . 
Even if there are shortcomings , I 'm still perfectly happy to forgive them . 
Even though I 'm not the type of person to call people friends readily , I 'm the kind who thinks about his friends and puts himself in their shoes . 
But I 'm also therefore pretty strict in choosing my friends . 
I also don 't understand at all why there are still so many people today who trust so much everything the newspapers say . 
Or is it that in their minds , today 's reports are still sacred like those of the past ? 
But then , in this world , there are still a lot of things that I don 't understand . 
Jokes . 
Giving myself a slap on the face . 
Song Dandan 's " The Secrets of Happiness , " Warm and Moving 
Key words : Song Dandan , The Secrets of Happiness 
A while ago , I read in the newspaper that Song Dandan had published a new book called " The Secrets of Happiness . " 
I really wanted to read it . 
Because I thought that as a woman of this age , with this kind of profession , she had experienced changes in her family and in her career . Having gone through these , what are her views on herself and on life ? 
As expected , I was not disappointed . After I read it , I had two feelings . First , I got an electric shock : looking at someone else 's life , you can see the image of your own life just the same . Second , I was also very much moved . It was full of things like the details of her love for her family . 
Why did I get an electric shock ? 
In the book , Song Dandan writes , " I missed an important principle in life : One is happier to give than to receive . 
I was always busy giving , busy making myself happy . 
I never received , and never understood how to . I neglected to allow other people to give , which is to say , I neglected other people 's right to make themselves happy . " 
I find that I 've also been always enjoying this kind of happiness . In the future perhaps I should be a bit more careful . 
It requires a certain amount of courage for a person to look steadily on their own past , and lay it all out in front of everyone . 
In here she includes her first love , her failed marriage with Ying Da and her deep dissection of herself and her love for her son . 
This book has another praiseworthy aspect , because at first the publisher must have given her a lot of pressure to focus more on cases like " I Love My Family , " " House of the Flying Daggers " and the series of sketches with Zhao Benshan . 
But she probably stood her ground . She only mentions Zhao Benshan a bit at the end , and as for " House of the Flying Daggers " and " I Love My Family , " she hardly mentions them . 
The whole book is full of the warm and moving reflections of a 40 - year - old woman on life , on love , on family , and on love for the family . 
Busy Vacation 
Key words : vacation , busy 
I 've been on vacation for nearly a week , but I haven 't had any time at all to relax . 
I went to the college for a meeting , and I have to prepare the materials for going on a trip next week for a conference , and a speech for the conference . 
This vacation will be very busy . 
Barring accidents , according to my schedule I have three conferences to attend and four or five cities to go to . 
My life has suddenly been filled up with many things : the same things , different things . I 've almost forgotten how I used to spend the vacations before . 
It seems that in my memory , I still didn 't have much relaxation time . 
It 's just that before I still had long periods of time that I could arrange myself , but this year it seems like there 's less time . 
Is this a good thing ? Or a bad thing ? 
Being busy , you feel a bit more substantial , but if there 's no results or no gains for your busy work , then there is much less point to being busy . 
But sometimes it seems that life can 't be completely measured in terms of results . Life is to be gradually experienced . Solidity and stability , substance and pleasure are also a kind of gains , even though sometimes this gain can 't be measured using society 's appraisal standards . 
Every person needs confirmation from society 's values and their own values . If we can 't get both , what do we do ? 
Marxism teaches us that we should take the values of society as primary , and proposes that individuals should contribute to society . But in reality , a healthy , wholesome society should also fully respect an individual 's wishes and value choices , and should create the conditions in which personal values can be realized . 
As all this occurred to my mind all of a sudden , I 'm discovering more and more that Marxist principles really are very effective . 
The truth really is like this , but when it actually comes to real life , people often find they are still bound to feel confused . 
Even if the realization of personal values doesn 't interfere with society 's values , will each one of us practical individuals be content with the realization of our own real values so much that we ignore the judgment of society ? 
Or can the satisfaction with our own values be separated from the judgment of society ? 
I 'd say it 's very difficult . 
So each of us is bound to pursue the extraordinary and beyond , even as we are working to be a good ordinary person . And if we waste our lives , we also will always blame ourselves . 
This could be said to be one side of socialized man . 
Being on vacation I still feel more or less a bit relaxed . 
At least , I have time to watch some DVDs , and I can relax myself and have fun for a while . 
I can say what I want , but I still have to work , and life goes on just the same . 
Next week I have to go to Xi 'an again for a conference . 
It 's a city that I 've never been to , but that I don 't seem to much like , because of some " prejudices . " 
I hope that this trip can change my impression of the city , haha . 
" Having a Very Feminist Life " 
Key words : men , feminism , era 
This afternoon , Ying called me . We chatted for a while , and then my watching " Happy Boys " came up . 
Ying said : " No way ! You are too cute . You finish watching Supergirls and then watch Happy Boys . You 're just a dedicated viewer of Hunan Satellite TV . " 
I said that was true . 
Ying said she had seen some of the selection programs for the boys , and thought they were all girly boys . I also thought the same , but I told her that the top four contestants had been selected from the five on Happy Boys . Next week three will be selected from the four . They were singing really well , each of them was excellent . 
Ying , who studies popular culture and consumer culture , also said excitedly that she would have a look too next week . After all , we had got to the most critical stage of the competition , and it would definitely be worth watching . And taking an interest in this would also be good for stocking up on some examples for future research . 
Then we started talking again about how this is an era of male beauty . 
Men have finally turned from " spectators " into " the spectated , " whereas , women , who had previously been the object , have become the subject . They can appreciate and face various male talent shows in this era of male beauty from the perspective of the observer . 
Ying said this was women 's liberation , a sign of feminism . 
Then next she said , " Don 't you think you are now having a very feminist life ? " 
When I heard what Ying said , I was so amused that I laughed out loud . 
This remark itself is filled with the meaning of feminism , it 's just that I don 't have a good capacity for analysis like Ying 's that can explain all these things more deeply and clearly . 
I like Chen Chusheng 's singing on Happy Boys very much . It 's got a very special texture , a power to pierce space and time right to your heart ; it 's very pure and very comforting . 
Su Xing sings in many different styles , and is full of feeling . He looks handsome and cultured , but he gives you a lively , relaxed feeling . 
Zhang Jie sings with great clarity and power , and particularly the two songs he nailed today , " The Way You Look " and " Past Goes with the Wind , " are both old songs that I like very much , they left a deep impression . 
Wei Chen has a cute , innocent face that extremely resembles Lu Yi 's . It 's said that he attracts a lot of girls , and of course his voice isn 't bad . 
The next clash between these four strong competitors should be very good to watch . 
I 'm looking forward to watching their great performances next week . 
Random Thoughts on Kimchi , June 29 
Key words : kimchi , Seoul 
Random Thoughts on Kimchi , June 29 I switched on international roaming , but when I got off the plane , my cell phone seemed to have had its power cut . It still didn 't have even one bar of signal . Maybe GSM 's effective coverage means the scope of the " heart , " and it will be effective from the next billing date . 
These few days , I 'm going to lose contact with everyone temporarily . Haha , will there be anyone who worries about me because of this ? 
I 've turned on their Secretary System , just want to be sure who 's missing me . 
It doesn 't matter if it 's business or personal . 
But the question is , who am I hoping will miss me ? 
My heart has turned completely blank again . I don 't know when it started . 
I don 't understand why there are always some people that you want to keep hold of but can 't , and some people that you don 't want to keep hold of but who always think that they can squeeze themselves in . Is it like when you 're talking about markets ? 
But can I always let the " white gloves " block up my heart , no matter whether or not there is a place for you ? 
But substance and heart cannot be talked about as if they were the same after all ! 
Our car is driving along the expressway to Busan . 
Our department head is driving silently , and I don 't have anything to say . 
Anyway , he doesn 't understand Chinese and doesn 't understand English , either , and me , I can only speak a very few very awkward sentences of English . 
I 'm looking at the computer , rather bored , punching the keyboard . In the car , apart from the sound of the keyboard , there 's only the pleasant voice of a Korean girl giving directions on the GPRS . Everything is too - - rather silent . 
Outside the window , all that 's left to see is never - ending green and a grey - blue sky . 
Silence is unusual for my personality . 
What I hadn 't expected is that the only thing in this country that gives me a sense of fellow feeling is actually English . 
Apart from making me dizzy like from radiation , those little circles I see everywhere have no other function at all . 
I think South Korea definitely will not produce compasses . 
Because there 's no demand in the market . 
Seoul is very clean , thoroughly clean , unfailingly clean . 
It 's just a pity that in the few days I am in Seoul , I won 't have time to go anywhere but my workplace and the department store . My entire impression is limited to what I see along the streets . 
Luckily , everything was still very good ! 
Koreans are polite in a traditional way . They smile meticulously , listen carefully . They 're elegant and quiet . 
Everything I 've been able to notice is the beautiful surface : traditional customs , ancient architectural styles , and absolutely scrupulous courtesy . 
Is this hypocritical ? 
Then it 's better to be a bit hypocritical , at least everyone is polite ! 
If you don 't see the ugly things , maybe you 'll think they don 't exist . 
Korean cuisine is really amazing ! 
It 's just that I don 't like it . I don 't understand why they suffer themselves going back and forth , when it 's only kimchi in various forms and on an assortment platter . Of course , there must be seaweed . 
Then , thinking again about it , the amount that Korean people know about their cuisine is still very awesome . They can tell the difference between kimchi that 's been pickled above ground and underground or for different lengths of time , and with up to minute precision . 
This shows , from one perspective , that the seriousness of Koreans might have something to do with the kimchi served from morning till night . 
My only headache is that I don 't know what kind of recipe with kimchi again somehow integrated will it have at the Japanese tofu restaurant that the head of department is going to take us to . 
Thinking of the Chinese food last night , I feel like I want to cry . It was completely Koreanized . The only thing I could eat turned out to be kimchi . 
A - ha , thanks to China Southern Airlines Co . and the kimchi it offers together with its in - flight meals . 
The airline must think that I want to start getting used to it from the moment I get on the plane . 
Two more days before I will go back to my country . If there still isn 't anyone to miss , then I can still miss a meal of Auntie 's braised pork ! 
After all , satisfaction for the stomach comes a bit more directly than for the heart . 
Of course , it has nothing at all to do with kimchi . 
Two Trees 
Two trees : one is me , one was my brother - in - law . 
We gave each other shade , and looked after each other . 
In my generation they all have a lot of children , but I only have sisters , no brothers . So the presence of my brother - in - law seemed extremely important . 
We both come from poor backgrounds . We had to take part in doing a lot of domestic chores when we were very small . Even though I always worked hard to act like a man and wanted to do my work like an expert , I never ever got my father 's ' approval . 
Ever since I was small , I 've suffered from sleepwalking , but it wasn 't too serious . But when I was doing work around the house , it 's hard to stop my mind wandering . 
For example , my father told me to put some plaster on the chimney at our old house . I nimbly climbed up onto the roof to do it . 
The chimney got plastered OK , but when it rained , water leaked into the room . The reason was that I had trodden on and broken the roof tiles . 
Another example , my father told me to change a light bulb , one of those old - fashioned incandescent bulbs . 
When I 'd climbed onto the stool , the light bulb in my hand slipped from my hand , fell onto the concrete and smashed . 
I 've got countless examples like this , so when my brother - in - law came to live with us , he naturally took over these various little jobs , and did them really beautifully and with no need to pay any labor cost . 
And I gleefully hid in a corner reading light novels thick as bricks . 
Later we grew up into two trees , two trees big enough to support the home of a family . 
And my father could not stop himself shrinking . Sitting in a wheelchair , he became a quiet bush in the leafy shade . 
No - one expected that things suddenly changed : at 50 , my brother - in - law suddenly contracted a serious illness . That great tree , so vital and bushy on the surface , came so close to that terrifying death in a way that was hard to believe . 
On that summer 's day , the sunlight bright enough to knock you out , the doctor outside the operating room at Peking Union Medical College Hospital said casually : it 's not worth operating . 
He can survive another two months at the most . 
At that moment it was like I 'd been hit by a stray bullet . My spirit left my body for an instant , and I stood there blankly like an idiot . 
I started sleepwalking again . I saw the old courtyard in our home , and the shadow of my young brother - in - law busy in the courtyard . 
It was the shrill sound of my elder sister 's crying that woke me up . I hastily ran to hug my sister , who slumped into sitting on the floor of the hospital corridor , and as we hugged the tears were streaming down our faces . 
The bright sunshine suddenly disappeared , and wave after wave of blackness appeared in front of me . 
After we came back from Beijing to our city here , my brother - in - law very quickly found out what his condition was . After he and my sister cried together for a while , his mood lightened instead . 
My brother - in - law started to methodically arrange for what would happen after his death . For example , he told his son : look after your grandmother for me . When the old lady dies , she wants to be buried in the same grave as your grandfather ; and how to open the grave when the remains are put together . 
Go and see your maternal grandfather often , and buy him some useful things when it 's the New Year or holidays . 
For example , he told my younger sister : when I 'm gone , you should often come and see your sister , she is sure to be extremely lonely on her own . 
I took as much time as I could to go and see him , but when he saw me his expression was one of shame . 
We often had nothing to say , just as two plants that have life but have no ability to converse . 
These are two adult trees . Experience of wind and rain has made us able to face hardship calmly . Do you need to pass anything more on to me ? 
It seemed there was no need . 
Because in your heart you know : after you 've gone , my sister , the children you and my sister had , and this big family can only rely on the tree that is me to support them alone . 
No - one forced me to be a man . 
Being a man , whether you want to or not , you must brace your back without hesitation and take up the burden . 
The only pity is : why did your tree have to wither so very early ? You should have had a full and flourishing old age . 
The day you went was the first day of the new year . 
Just at the time when all the Chinese people in the world were rejoicing and welcoming the new spring , you left , alone . 
Perhaps in another space and time , another living baby sprout has just been born ? 
X Minutes of My Life 
The reason for such a trendy - looking title is that at that moment of extreme desperation , my racing brain had no chance to take note of the time . 
Like an innocent person who receives a death penalty judgment out of the blue - would he still calmly and leisurely pick over the grammatical errors in the " Verdict ? " 
It was a winter 's day , and it was very cold in the youth center . 
And I don 't know whose duty day it was , but the heater hadn 't been fired up for a day . 
Because there was word of a strong earthquake , when we went home in the evening , we were also reluctant to restart the fire . 
On the long plank - bed that could sleep 12 people , we four wrapped ourselves in cotton - padded quilts and while shivering , played a poker game of " three - on - one " under the dim lamplight to win food coupons . 
Suddenly a noise thundered towards us from afar . We few looked at one another for just an instant , then immediately realized that a disaster had struck . 
Then we threw down the cards in our hands , flew down to the floor and through the two narrow doorways , scrambled to get out . 
Just at the moment that we ran out of the dormitory , the poor thatched dwelling built with stones disintegrated in an instant . 
We had rushed out into the yard , and it was like we were standing on a pitching and rolling boat . We fell back and forth Like Weebles and couldn 't anchor ourselves . 
Within a few seconds , all of the buildings around us , + unlike the sedate images of days past , let out a strange " jiaah " noise one after another as they danced a half - crazed break dance before collapsing on themselves in a puff of smoke and dust . 
The power cables above our heads naturally couldn 't bear being the odd ones out , and snapped " crack crack , " then fled like whips in all directions . 
Meanwhile , in front of us and behind us , the rampaging quake demon was setting off ceremonial fireworks to celebrate his own creation . The spectacular earthquake lights could rival the stage effects in any major war movie , and the rumbling sound of the earth was like war drums urging on the fighting . They tortured every weakened nerve . 
At that time we only had one idea : the human race 's last day had come ! 
I could imagine it : the earth under our feet would open up with a crash , and boiling lava like molten steel would issue its flaming invitation , and humans , like bugs , would be cast in free - fall into the lava one after another . Too stingy to give off a whiff of blue smoke , they would vanish in an instant . 
My spine felt comfortably numb , as though it had been injected with freezing water . In the ashy darkness the faces of my companions floated unsteadily like paper masks . 
I was thinking : is this how humanity bids farewell to this wonderful world ? Will tens of thousands of years of civilization vanish without a trace now ? 
But I wasn 't yet 20 years old ! The blossom of my youth had only just started to bloom , and I had only just perceived the joy of existence . I was so unwilling to leave beautiful life ! 
And my parents , my family ? Where are you ? What are you now doing ? Are you still living in this world ? 
At the moment when I faced the savage grinning face of death , I missed you so much ! 
... In my confusion , I don 't know how long it was before I finally realized with joy that the sound of the earthquake was getting quieter little by little , the shaking of the earth was slowing little by little , and the fireworks were also no longer sparkling above my head . 
A tanker , tossing on stormy seas , finally slowly sailed into a calm harbor . 
A young and easily breakable heart was carefully returned to its original state after going through a manic ransacking . 
Oh , Earth , my home , you 've finally allowed us to feel again a home 's warmth and closeness ! 
A feeling of survivor 's luck ran slowly like warm water from beneath my feet through my whole body . 
When Yu Doudou , who had just turned 17 , could stand steadily , she faced the yard of the youth center that had once been calm and warm , but now was all broken - down ruins , and suddenly started sobbing loudly . 
Everyone was infected , and hot tears flowed everywhere . 
Snow started to fall from the sky . Was it a lament floating down for the misfortunes of humanity ? 
That year , the Haicheng earthquake claimed the lives of as many as 1,000 people . 
An expert said : It 's lucky the forecasts came in time , and that it happened before people had gone to bed , otherwise the strong earthquake , measuring 7.3 , would have claimed the lives of at least 100,000 people ! 
Only a year later , the Tangshan earthquake erupted , and more than 200,000 people died . 
The Things That Go on in the Village 
There are many households in the village . Of them all , the members of a family called South are the most disliked . In the village there 's a common saying that goes : guard against fire , guard against robbery , and guard against the Souths . 
Actually , the South family are pretty honest . 
Some people steal a melon or something from someone else 's land at any time . And the South family are just committing some petty theft at the worst and do not deserve to be isolated by the whole village . 
No - one has clean hands , so who have we Souths offended ? 
The Souths started to organize some very worthy activities , showing that this village was first established by the ancestors of the South family , that the Souths had always been a major rice - growing family , and that they had produced quite a number of famous people in history . In addition , they had made a great contribution to improving the village . 
At that same time , the Souths warmly invited the village cadres to their home to have a look and sit for a while . 
In all , the South family are very aspiring and proactive , striving to be powerful . 
Not long ago , the West family did something very disgraceful . They damaged the Souths ' young crops very badly . 
The family called West are known throughout the village for matchmaking . All of the young guys in the village have something to thank the Wests for . 
If it weren 't for the good matchmaking of the Wests , how would each of you families and households be able to take good care of production ? 
But this time , the Wests bashed down the Souths ' young crops with illegal bricks in a place called Hongdong . It was truly terrible , and the whole village was furious . They all said that there are no good people in the West family . 
The Souths demanded an explanation from the Wests , attracting the sympathy of everyone in the village . 
Everyone in the village poured abuse on the Wests . 
Thus , the battlefield shifted to the West 's house . 
The Souths were determined to project a good image before the 17th village meeting , to make the South family , which is most populous and thriving , developed . 
Even though the cadres in the village urge everyone to get along harmoniously with one another every day , this village named China is never peaceful . 
The most annoying thing is , in just three short months , even the pigs have started oinking crazily and stirring up trouble . They want to raise their price ! 
Two years ago , the chickens in every village were squawking about catching a cold . Didn 't they all get killed ? 
Pigs , why don 't you think ? 
If you talk about calling for a revolution again , you 'll have no way of avoiding the chop ! 
Meanwhile , the America Village and Britain Village that are used to bullying people don 't seem peaceable either even though they are wealthy . 
There are a few vagabonds who knocked down the tall building in America Village today and will throw some exploding pots in the metro in Britain Village tomorrow . It 's enough to make anyone frightened , isn 't it ? 
Because of this , most people in China Village think that even though it is terrible not to be able to afford a place to stay , not to be able to afford to go to the doctor and not to be able to afford to go to school , if they can peacefully farm some land , do some jobs , make a few connections , then they have already entered a new era . 
The Souths , the Wests - what family hasn 't got skeletons in its cupboard ? 
Just take the Wan family , who live in a little + bay to the southeast of the village . Even though the head of that household is a bit shameless , isn 't our great China Village willing to take this family in all the same ? 
Looking to the 2008 Inter - Village Sports Contest that will be held in our China Village , let 's have less of the bad things that have happened in the village , and let 's deal with the bad kids in the village . 
Every family , every household , light the lamps and stoke the fires . If you have money , give money ; if you can work , then work . 
When the time comes , everyone goes to the village common to see a golden egg laid in the bird 's nest !

Eric looks at Google ( Google ) China 
Key words : Eric , Google , Google , China Poster : an ordinary Google ( Google ) employee 
I 'm an employee who joined Google China relatively early . In the last two years , we 've gone through a lot of challenges . Some we had predicted when they arrived ; others really were beyond what we had imagined at the time . 
Yesterday , I heard that in this quarter 's financial report the company had a section talking specially about China 's development , and I happened to hear Eric reply to a question about China . This gave me a lot to think about , so I 'm translating it as encouragement for everyone . 
This remark was made by Google ( Google ) CEO Eric when he was replying to a question by a reporter during the Google Inc . Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call ( Google Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call ) ( http://investor.google.com/earnings.html ) , saying that he is absolutely satisfied with the results that Google China has achieved so far , and that he is full of confidence about Google 's prospects for development in the Chinese market . 
Eric says that in China we have top - quality people , ever - improving facilities , and constantly enriched localized product lines . 
He thinks that even though Google 's success is not yet necessarily visible , as far as Google China is concerned , it 's been an excellent beginning , and that with hard work from the China team , support from headquarters , and a dauntless spirit , he firmly believes that in the future Google will achieve astonishing success in China . 
That 's true . What 's important is that we keep forging onwards and upwards . Because we grew up here , we have deep feelings for this place , and we deeply believe that Google should give China more , more ; that it should give its users more , more .

Strapless Flip - Flops 
It 's the fashion to do everything top - less now , especially in summer . Everyone is itching to just go running naked , because any clothing will make you feel hotter . 
You maybe already knew that T - backs , which have been fashionable for many years , have been defeated by G - strings , because the latter doesn 't have any straps at all . 
So in an age like this , the flip - flops you 're wearing on your feet may now be behind the times , because now an all - new kind of strapless flip - flop has appeared . It 's only got a sole . 
How do you wear it if it 's got no straps ? 
We 're not gods , and the manufacturer can 't do magic . 
This flip - flop ... sticks directly to the sole of your foot . This is no spoof product , this is a real item in the shops . The price is about 13.5 US dollars a pair . 
This is another " I 've imagined it existing , but never imagined that it really did exist " product . It leaves me dumbfounded . 
The manufacturer thinks this kind of flip - flop is amazingly cool . Don 't believe me ? 
Please look at : The soles of my feet feel uncomfortable just looking at them . [ via F.C ]

Lenovo about to Bring out High - end ThinkPad T61p 
Key words : Lenovo , ThinkPad 
The ThinkPad T61p , which Lenovo will release on July 17 ( US time ) , will also be the highest - spec T series notebook computer , and it has given us a rather nice surprise : UWB ( Wisair Ultra Wideband ) . 
That 's right , just like the R400 notebook computer , linked to a high - speed transmission wireless expansion slot . 
( via ) This 15.4 inch notebook computer features the Santa Rosa processor and Nvidia Quadro FX 570M graphics chipsets , and of course the protective element of the T61 's toughened metal rollcage for sure . But the price is cheaper than expected : only asking for about 15,000 renminbi . 
Watching Big Movies without a Screen , Pictures Released of Cell Phone Projector 
Key words : Cell phone 
Korean company Iljin Display has brought out a laser projector module no bigger than a coin . 
Because the module is so small in size , this kind of projector module could even be installed in a cell phone . On a wall , you can see a projection seven inches in size . 
( via ) Traditional projectors include three different LCD screens , each responsible for outputting a different video signal : red , green and blue . But this mini - projector can switch among the three colors by using only a single LCD screen . This way it has cut the size and production costs of the projector . 
An official statement says that the LCD screen in this projector is only 0.24 inches in size , and could very easily be integrated into a cell phone . 
Currently more than half of the cell phones on the market include a camera , and it is estimated that cell phones with internal projectors will soon appear on the market . But whether the market will embrace them is really very difficult to say .
