u@@ .@@ s . to start photograph@@ ing and finger@@ printing foreign travelers entering the country
( af@@ p , washington , january 5 ) as singapore , home to the largest airport in asia , endorsed deployment of armed police on air@@ liners to counter the terrorist threats , the un@@ ites states started the new rules today of photograph@@ ing and finger@@ printing foreign travelers entering the country .
washington authorities tightened the check - ups on arriving foreign travelers at a time when concerns for global aviation safety are rapidly rising . in the last week , these concerns have forced the cancellation of several flights coming and returning to the united states .
the new photograph@@ ing and finger@@ printing requirements apply only to foreign visitors who must have visas to enter the united states . this type of visitors is generally expected to reach 23 million this year .
according to the department of homeland security , which is in charge of implementing us - visit program , citizens from 28 countries , mostly european nations , are exempt from the above described procedure .
immigration groups criticized the program as a violation on civil liberties and as a step toward creating a surveillance society . homeland security secretary ridge aggressively defended the program .
in an interview with n@@ b@@ c , ridge said : " one of primary responsibilities of any government is to secure its borders . it is to do this job well that we are promoting this program . i don 't think it is ob@@ tru@@ sive ; as a matter of fact , it takes only about 15 seconds and apparently nobody seems to mind . "
by 2005 , every port of entry on land , sea and air will be properly equipped with the photograph@@ ing and finger@@ printing technology .
all u@@ .@@ s . visas and passports will eventually include " bi@@ ometric identi@@ fi@@ ers " such as photos and fingerprints .
before the above program came into effect , the united states just raised its national terror alert in december last year .

y@@ oo young - kwan made the above remark after washington rejected py@@ ong@@ yang 's recent offer of a nuclear freeze in return for major concessions and indicated both parties still need to resolve their serious dis@@ agreements prior to the nuclear talks .
y@@ oo young - kwan said schedul@@ ing problems among the six participating nations have actually ruled out the possibility of re@@ convening the six - nation talks in january .
however , he gave no clues as to why the new round of talks can be delayed till june or later .
russian deputy foreign minister los@@ yu@@ kov attributed this to the hard@@ ened positions of the united states and north korea .
he participated in the first round of six - nation talks held in beijing in august last year .
los@@ yu@@ kov told the inter@@ fax after his meeting with some senior chinese officials yesterday : " the reasons are still the same old ones , - - - lack of mutual trust and excessive demands set by both sides . "
after north korea demanded once again that the united states promise concessions prior to the new round of six - nation talks , y@@ oon young - kwan suggested that the talks could be delayed for a long period of time .
washington accused py@@ ong@@ yang of setting preconditions for the new round of six - nation talks .
the united states is seeking north korea 's commitment to abolishing its nuclear weapons program .
north korea said it will freeze its nuclear facilities if washington lifts its economic sanctions against py@@ ong@@ yang and resumes energy aid .
in the past , north korea also insisted on signing a non - aggression treaty with the united states .

dean has made opposition to the iraq war a cent@@ er@@ piece of his campaign .
ira@@ qi guerr@@ illas use high - tech weapons against u@@ .@@ s . helicopters
( af@@ p , washington , january 18 ) senior u@@ .@@ s . military officials said that ira@@ qi insurg@@ ents are using increasingly sophisticated weapons to attack u@@ .@@ s . helicopters .
a group of senior officials familiar with a classified military report told the new york times today that the findings in the classified military study show the ira@@ qi guerr@@ illas have used rocket - propelled gren@@ ades and the more advanced heat - seeking surface - to - air missiles to attack u@@ .@@ s . helicopters .
they said the study was conducted prior to the three ira@@ qi attacks on u@@ .@@ s . helicopters this month . however , the three most recent attacks would only reinforce the conclusion of the study .
the military study mainly aims at providing u@@ .@@ s . pilots ways of evading attacks by ira@@ qi guerr@@ illas using such weapons . the officials would not discuss new findings .
however , given the methodology used in this new wave of attacks in iraq , it is trou@@ bling to find that the ira@@ qi guerr@@ illas have carefully studied the modes of combat of the u@@ .@@ s . aircraft .
what was even more trou@@ bling , the researchers found , was that the ira@@ qi guerr@@ illas have used sa@@ -@@ 16 shoulder - fired missiles on more than one occasion .
this type of missile with its precision guidance system is very hard for pilots to evade .
a senior u@@ .@@ s . military avi@@ ator in the per@@ sian gulf region said : " every time our aircraft is shot down , it is a big strategic victory for our enemy .
it not only makes headline news but also announces the instant winner . therefore , the enemy thinks it is a very useful trick . "
nine u@@ .@@ s . helicopters have been shot down or have crashed since october 25 last year , killing at least 49 u@@ .@@ s . soldiers .
car@@ ter praises dean on eve of u@@ .@@ s . democratic ca@@ uc@@ uses in i@@ ow@@ a
( af@@ p , plains , ge@@ or@@ gia , january 18 ) on the eve of the first face - off among the democratic presidential candidates at the party � s ca@@ uc@@ uses in i@@ ow@@ a , the former u@@ .@@ s . president car@@ ter praised the candidate dean , the former governor of ver@@ mont , for his " courageous and out@@ spoken " opposition to the iraq war .
in his hometown of plains , ge@@ or@@ gia , car@@ ter told reporters : " i 've been particularly grateful to the courageous and out@@ spoken stance and position governor dean has taken from the very beginning . "
the no@@ bel peace lau@@ re@@ ate said : " in the past year and a half , i spent a lot of time strongly opposing this totally unnecessary and unjust iraq war .
despite my utmost efforts , the war has started , and now it is proven that the war was based on erroneous intelligence and misleading statements and a sustained demonstration of a tragedy . "
car@@ ter praised dean as a staunch " advocate for peace . " though he did not officially endorse dean in his statement , his remark above was reported by all tv networks in the united states .
as a left - leaning former governor of a northern state , dean could be at a disadvantage in the south when facing the centr@@ ist retired general clar@@ k from ar@@ k@@ ans@@ as , but car@@ ter 's support may increase his chances of winning in the conservative and religion - conscious southern states .
in a recent television interview , car@@ ter said he considered dean as most likely democratic candidate to run against bush .
democrats attack bush for creating new axis of evil
( af@@ p , washington , january 21 ) on the evening of the 20th , u@@ .@@ s . opposition democrats accused president bush of leading the united states into isolation from the rest of the world and creating a new " axis of evil " with his policies .
when democrats re@@ broadcast the president 's state of union address , house democratic leader pel@@ osi l@@ ashed out on the human and financial costs caused by last year 's military invasion of iraq .
with the upcoming u@@ .@@ s . presidential election ( u@@ .@@ s . presidential election is to be held on november 2 this year ) , democrats are attacking bush with greater intensity .
clar@@ k , one of the major cont@@ enders for the democratic presidential nomination , said that bush has created his own " axis of evil . "
bush co@@ ined the phrase of " axis of evil " two years ago in his state of union address to describe some countries that threaten the united states .
clar@@ k said : " that is the axis of fiscal policies that threaten our future , foreign policies that threaten our security and domestic policies that put an end to families . "
u@@ .@@ s . again urges ir@@ anian authorities to allow free and fair parliamentary election
( af@@ p , washington , january 21 ) as the political crisis between iran 's religious conserv@@ atives and reform@@ ists over the qualification of parliamentary candidates continues to escal@@ ate , the united states again urged iran to ensure that the upcoming february election be free and fair .
state department deputy spokesman ere@@ li said : " we think it is important that ir@@ anian leaders allow free and fair election through an electoral process that meets international standards and that ir@@ anian government must respond to the needs of its people . "
i@@ rel@@ i said : " the political situation in iran is evolving . there are many developments each day and we are closely watching the situation . "
ere@@ li made the above remark when asked by reporters about the resign@@ ations of iran 's cabinet ministers and vice presidents .
according to reports , several cabinet ministers and vice presidents in ir@@ anian president k@@ hat@@ ami 's reform@@ ist government handed in their resign@@ ations in a protest against the mass disqualification of reform@@ ist candidates for the parliamentary election to be held on the 20th of next month .
small plane cr@@ ashes into residential area in japan , killing three on board
( af@@ p , tokyo , january 22 ) a small plane crashed into a residential area in yam@@ an@@ ashi prefecture in central japan today , killing all three people on board . fortunately , the nearby homes , a kindergarten and a hospital were all " miracul@@ ously " spared .
yam@@ am@@ oto , an emergency official at the yam@@ an@@ ashi prefectural government , said the single - engine cess@@ na 17@@ 2@@ p pil@@ oted by a 32 - year - old crashed into a small parking lot in the area .
one of the passengers who died in the accident was a photographer . he was taking aerial pictures of children lining up in formation of letters outside a local kindergarten .
the kindergarten is only 100 meters away from the site of the plane crash .
yam@@ am@@ oto said : " the small plane crashed right next to a few houses and a hospital . all three on board were killed .
it is really a miracle that this plane did not crash into the houses or the hospital .
at the time , there was a strong wind and the oil was leaking . if the plane had crashed into the houses or the hospital ,
it would have certainly caused a huge fire . "
an aviation official at the transport ministry said the plane took off this morning from ch@@ of@@ u airport in western tokyo and was scheduled to return in two hours .
as of the moment , the cause of the accident is not yet clear .
contact with mar@@ s ro@@ ver spirit lost , says nas@@ a
( af@@ p , washington , january 22 ) nas@@ a officials said today that the agency has lost contact with the u@@ .@@ s . exploration ro@@ ver spirit that has landed on mar@@ s due to a serious problem on the ro@@ ver .
the@@ is@@ inger , project manager of the mar@@ s exploration ro@@ ver mission , said : " we found there is a very serious an@@ omal@@ y on the ro@@ ver . "
nas@@ a said yesterday that scientists were unable to send daily instructions to spirit because of thunder and lightning over australia .
however , experts now believe it is a more serious problem that has caused the breakdown in communications .
the spirit exploration ro@@ ver arrived on mar@@ s on january 3 and started its search last week for signs of past life on the red planet .
its twin ro@@ ver , " opportunity , " is scheduled to land at night between january 24 and january 25 .
this mission of exploration costs 8@@ 20 million u@@ .@@ s . dollars and it was originally expected that both solar - powered ro@@ vers could operate for about three months .
u@@ .@@ s . optimistic about resuming talks with north korea after conferring with japan and south korea
( af@@ p , washington , january 22 ) the united states said today it is " very optimistic " about resuming the multi - nation talks as soon as possible to end the north korea nuclear stalemate . however , the united states also said only some slight progress has been made in getting py@@ ong@@ yang back to the negotiation table .
k@@ elly , the top u@@ .@@ s . diplomat in charge of asia pacific affairs , said : " we think there is a great chance of resuming six - nation talks soon , but at this time we have not got any specific date . "
k@@ elly had consulted with senior officials of japan and south korea on north korea 's nuclear developments . he said there is still a great chance of holding the second round of talks , which will eventually make north korea agree to disman@@ tle its nuclear programs .
k@@ elly told reporters : " we think there is a very good chance of resuming six - nation talks . "
however , he said the agreement to be reached should be highly comprehensive , including py@@ ong@@ yang 's ver@@ if@@ iable pledges to eliminate completely its uranium enrichment program , pl@@ ut@@ on@@ ium re@@ processing and existing atomic weapons .
north korea had shown to the non - official u@@ .@@ s . representatives what they called pl@@ ut@@ on@@ ium , but denied having any uranium enrichment program , refu@@ ting the u@@ .@@ s . allegation that py@@ ong@@ yang admitted to having a uranium enrichment program at the 2002 talks .
who confirms the sixth death from bird flu in vietnam
( af@@ p , han@@ oi , january 24 ) who confirmed today the sixth death from bird flu in vietnam as a 13 - year - old boy from ho chi min@@ h city in southern vietnam died after contracting avian influenza virus .
this is the first confirmed case of death from bird flu in southern vietnam .
vietnamese health officials announced earlier to the public the sixth death from bird flu , raising the death toll from the virus in vietnam to at least six and triggering the world � s concern that the virus is further spreading to humans .
the boy earlier tested positive for the h@@ 5@@ n@@ 1 bird flu virus and was therefore confirmed as having contracted the virus .
n@@ guyen the d@@ ung , director of health department of ho chi min@@ h city , told af@@ p today that the boy died on january 22 in no@@ . 2 children 's hospital in ho chi min@@ h city .
he was sent to the hospital for respiratory symptoms on the 19th .
who also said it is monitoring the development of the outbreak closely with vietnam authorities .
another vietnamese official said two sisters also died of a severe respiratory disease in a hospital in han@@ oi on the 22nd . health authorities suspect the two were also victims of bird flu .
bird flu hits millions of chickens in indonesia
( af@@ p , jakarta , january 25 ) indonesia 's ministry of agriculture announced today that an outbreak of bird flu has caused the death of millions of chickens but no cases of human infection have been reported so far .
sud@@ ar@@ j@@ at , director for animal husbandry of ministry of agriculture , told the public not to panic since no humans in indonesia have so far been infected with this potentially deadly disease .
outbreaks of bird flu have been reported in seven countries in asia so far and six people have already died of the disease in vietnam .
indonesian officials said earlier that the bird flu which infected most of poultry on j@@ ava and bal@@ i islands last november was new@@ castle disease .
as late as this morning , pri@@ y@@ on@@ o , spokesman for ministry of agriculture , was still saying there was no sign yet of any bird flu in indonesia .
he told af@@ p in the evening it is still not yet certain whether this outbreak is caused by the h@@ 5@@ n@@ 1 virus .
most of the deaths from bird flu in vietnam were caused by the h@@ 5@@ n@@ 1 virus .
the spokesman said a combination of new@@ castle disease and type a bird flu has killed 4.7 million fow@@ ls since last november .
about 60 % of them died of new@@ castle disease .
he said no order has been issued yet for an immediate cul@@ ling .
quoting sud@@ ar@@ j@@ at , indonesia 's state news agency reported that authorities have conducted tests using ser@@ ums from the uk and australia to determine the strain of virus , but the results will not be available until wednesday or thursday . the government will then send the report to the relevant international organizations .
snow over western and northern europe wrea@@ ks havoc to traffic and transport
( af@@ p , paris , january 29 ) bl@@ iz@@ z@@ ard has covered most of western and northern europe , disrupting traffic and railroad transport and forcing hundreds of flight canc@@ ellations in britain , germany and den@@ mark .
in london , a spokesman for hea@@ throw airport said that last night 's snow drif@@ ts caused over 200 flight canc@@ ellations at the airport and suspended another 80 flights early this morning .
g@@ at@@ wick and stan@@ sted , two other airports near london , are also affected by the snow drif@@ ts and a total of 18 flights have been canceled due to the weather .
in germany , the win@@ try weather led to the cancellation of at least 60 flights to fran@@ k@@ furt international airport , the largest airport in the country .
transport authorities said dozens of other flights to fran@@ k@@ furt were delayed and the air traffic may be affected by the weather for the rest of the day today .
in france , restrictions on road traffic went into force in paris after an overnight snow@@ fall , but similar measures in other parts of the country were lifted this morning .
all services are reportedly back to near normal at major airports in paris . yesterday , a combination of snow and fog led to a series of delays at de ga@@ ul@@ le airport .
however , airport authorities in paris advised air travelers to check whether their flights will be on schedule before leaving home .
with the exception of the med@@ iterranean coast , most of france is covered in white snow .
taiwan and japan , both being democr@@ acies , should regard it as their obligation or even as a responsibility to make joint efforts toward consolidating democracy in asia .
in order to promote democratic values , the government in our country will establish the " taiwan democracy foundation " in the coming days with the cooperation of international political parties as one of its focuses .
through this foundation , the democratic progress party hopes to work together with democratic parties in other countries , share its experience of promoting democracy with other countries and make its contribution to the peace , stability and prosperity in asia so that our ideal of establishing " asian democratic alliance " will be realized as soon as possible .
in a rapidly changing world , a slightest shift in the balance of power in the region would affect the entire area , putting the security of all countries under test .
in the asia pacific region , north korea , complacent about its possession of nuclear weapons , has repeatedly test - fired missiles that flew over japan � s airspace since the united states started the war on iraq last month . in addition , china has long been actively expanding its military arsen@@ al and has deployed ballistic missiles aiming at taiwan .
all this has posed grave threats to the security of taiwan and japan as well as the rest of asia pacific region .
these issues concerning the consolidation of democracy and safeguarding of security need formal security mechanisms before they can be discussed and resolved .
since today 's symposium is the first official dialogue on security between the d@@ p@@ p , the ruling party of taiwan , and the liberal democratic party , the ruling party of japan and parliament members of other political parties , its importance is self - evident .
i myself also hope that in addition to the bilateral dialogue between taiwan and japan , the united states , japan , south korea and other neighboring countries in the asia pacific region will in the future be able to jointly promote the establishment of " security dialogue mechanism " and also support taiwan � s participation in the multilateral dialogue organizations in the region so as to implement the idea of " cooperative security . "
this is an important moment today that encourages us to continue pushing forward with the reform . we hereby express our appreciation in acknowledgement of all the efforts by our party members in demonstrating the will of this party and their joint efforts in achieving the goals of the reform .
" the withdrawal of political parties from radio and television stations " is not only the most basic requirement for the implementation of media reform but also a concept the d@@ p@@ p has always adhered to . that our party is in power should mean the reform will be accelerated , not that we become a hurdle or a burden to the reform .
we also understand that in order to promote this goal , elected public officials in our party should take the lead in withdrawing themselves from media businesses . this will be a small step toward media reform but it will also be a crucial step .
during the era of the martial law when media was monopolized , many party members , in order to gain access to open public forum , engaged themselves in such difficult tasks as establishing the fourth tv station and local radio stations , through which they hoped to break the existing restrictions and help promote the reform of the media environment .
for example , comrade tr@@ ong c@@ hai spent much time and energy in those days in establishing the fourth ter@@ restrial television station and eventually founded " form@@ os@@ a television . "
this action brought a significant impact on the entire media environment particularly in that it shattered the long@@ time monopoly of the three stations and provided more space for the development of cable television stations .
however , we must understand that due to the historical limitation , there were many things that were done because they had to be done in the course of promoting the reform . therefore , when the media is completely open and free today , it means we have accomplished the mission set for that phase . to allow the reform to continue its course , we must make choices as to what to keep and what to sacrifice .
the central standing committee declared that all elected public officials in our party should withdraw themselves completely from their media businesses by the next session of the legislative yuan , namely , september 5 , so as to set an example of fulfilling their promise to the people .
we are very much pleased that all of you can give priority to the ideal and goal of the party . people like tr@@ ong c@@ hai , chang chun - hung , chou ching - yu , hou shui - sheng , kao meng - ting , huang n@@ ai - hui and shen ming - kung and others , who made a great deal of contribution during the democratic movement , are all able to sacrifice their minor individual interest in favor of promoting the media reform .
ruling does not mean enjoying power , but assuming more responsibilities .
despite setbacks and bump@@ y progress it has encountered since it took power , the democratic progressive party has always managed to turn challenges into motivation for making progress and has steadily led taiwan in deepening democratization while keeping in line with universal values of global democracy , peace and prosperity .
this is because it is always our belief that only people are the masters of this country , and the d@@ p@@ p 's duty is to elevate the party 's founding principles of " integrity , diligence and love for the homeland " to the bright vision of " reform , progress and good life , " and lay the foundation for a lasting peace and stability for 23 million tai@@ w@@ anese people .
for a long time , the d@@ p@@ p has played a role of " government performing multiple functions � in promoting taiwan 's diplomacy and has achieved brilliant results .
despite china � s constant diplomatic pressure and military threats , we have never cav@@ ed in , because we have grasped our fate in our own hands , and despite the absence of rich resources , the d@@ p@@ p has made small but steady progress in expanding space for taiwan � s participation in international affairs .
" diversified diplomacy " is the cent@@ er@@ piece of the d@@ p@@ p 's overall diplomatic strategy . in the past year , we used " council of asian liber@@ als & democrats " as a platform and successfully shared our experience with other countries in east asia and communicated with other political parties on issues of the region � s economic challenges , democratic reform of political parties , eradication of merc@@ enary politics , solutions to poverty resulting from globalization , political propaganda vs. communication and participation of young people in the government and other related topics .
in march of next year , i myself will officially assume chairmanship of � council of asian liber@@ als & democrats , � and i hope that in the capacity of a leader of an international organization , i can create more opportunities for taiwan to contribute more to the international community .
in addition , the d@@ p@@ p has also actively involved in the affairs of � liberal international � after becoming its official member last year .
apart from sending staff to serve as human rights commission@@ ers in the secretariat of its headquarters in london , we will also cooperate with other member parties and hold seminars on political reforms in central and south america , europe and other regions .
on september 28 , our party celebrated its 17th birthday .
the 17 - year - old democratic progressive party has followed all the way its ideal of democracy and has been filled with strength for reforms and progress .
we have won the trust of tai@@ w@@ anese people because we are always on the side of democratic reforms . it is also for this reason that our responsibility and mission in the future have become more serious and significant .
when we took over the government three years ago , the previous ruling party had w@@ aded through six amendments to the constitution in the 1990s .
from handling the total re - election of the parliament in 1991 , holding the direct presidential election in 1994 , freezing the provincial government functions in 1997 to abolishing the permanent status of the national assembly in 2000 , this series of difficult process of amending the constitution , is in fact the path the tai@@ w@@ anese people have followed in strengthening their sovereignty and justification of democratization .
if we regard the direct presidential election by popular vote in 1996 as the most important symbol of taiwan as an independent and sovereign nation , then by 2006 this " complete " nation will have reached the age of 10 .
after a decade of practice , we must ponder over this question : as an independent , sovereign and democratic nation , what should we pursue next ?
i must say that in the next stage we should further pursue the deepening of democratization and a more efficient constitutional government system so as to be able to lead the tai@@ w@@ anese people in meeting the harsh challenges of the new century .
as the largest continent in the world with an area constituting nearly 30 % of the land on earth , a current population of about 60 % of the world total and a total economic output making up a quarter of the world total , asia should and can make outstanding contribution to the world 's peace and development .
asia boasts time - honored and brilliant cultures . the yellow river , the yang@@ tze river valley , the indu@@ s and the gang@@ es , the e@@ uph@@ rates and the ti@@ gr@@ is basin are all famous crad@@ les of human civilization .
in the long course of history , the asian peoples have made remarkable contributions to the development of human civilization .
since the modern period , asia has undergone great changes and suffered numerous hardships . in order to win liberation and seek development , people in all asian countries have made un@@ tiring efforts and achieved tremendous accomplishments .
however , it is still a long way to go before asia can rise anew and rejuven@@ ate .
strengthening cooperation , promoting development and creating win - win situations are the only ways through which asia can rise anew and rejuven@@ ate . it is also where the fundamental interest of asian people lies .
in the new situation of the millennium , the development of asia is facing new opportunities .
peace and development are still the main topics in today 's time . an overall peaceful international environment has provided favorable external conditions for the development of asia .
economic globalization is deepening ; worldwide revolu@@ tions in science and technology are making progress by leaps and bounds ; and optimization and reorganization of international manufacturing resources and industrial outsourcing are accelerating . all these provide asian countries opportunities to utilize international funds , import advanced technologies , open up global markets and boost domestic economic growth .
with its rich resources and vast market , asia is the most economically viable region in the world and promises tremendous potential for development .
large population and under@@ development are two major national conditions of china .
since china has a population of 1.3 billion , no matter how tiny a problem is , it becomes a huge one once it is multiplied by 1.3 billion ; no matter how abundant financial and material resources are , they shrink to exceptionally min@@ us@@ cul@@ e average per capita once they are divided by 1.3 billion .
this is what chinese leaders must keep firmly in their mind at any time .
to solve the problem of 1.3 billion people , we can only rely on ourselves and nobody else .
since the founding of the people 's republic of china , we have made great achievements in our development , yet at the same time we have taken some det@@ ours and missed a few opportunities .
after we started the reform and opening up in 1978 , we finally found a right way for our own development .
that is : chinese people build socialism with chinese characteristics independently and autonom@@ ously .
its essence is to mobilize all positive factors , liberate and develop productive forces , and respect and ensure chinese people 's freedom to pursue happiness .
china 's reform and opening up extended from rural areas to cities and from the economical area to political , cultural and social areas .
each time it goes further , its objective , after all , is always to emancipate the competitive power of all labor , knowledge , technology , management and capital , and allow a complete utilization of all resources capable of creating social wealth .
in recent years , the world has been undergoing profound changes . science and technology are making progress with each passing day ; the global productivity keeps going up ; and the markets in the world are in closer contact with one another , opening up historic opportunities for the development of all nations .
however , it is noteworthy that power politics , regional conflicts , terrorism , epidemics , environmental deterioration and other issues are still threatening the stability and development in the world .
the negative impact of economic globalization has increased the risk and cost of economic and social development in the developing countries , some of whom are even at risk of being margin@@ alized .
at present , we are still facing many uncertainties in spite of a gradual recovery of the global economy .
the stalled do@@ ha round of multilateral trade negotiations , trade protectionism and other complicated issues have increased the hardship for the developing countries .
fortunately , a great many developing countries have made remarkable achievements in making progress , implementing reforms and building a prosperous homeland .
on the international arena , developing countries , relying on organizations such as non - alliance movement and g@@ -@@ 77 , have strengthened their solidarity and cooperation and made significant contributions in safeguarding their own legitimate rights and changing the unjust international political and economical order . they have become an important force in democr@@ ati@@ zing the international relations .
in the meantime , great achievements have also been made in exchanges and cooperation among developing countries and their economic contacts have become more and more frequent .
from the and@@ es to the me@@ kong , from the establishment of arab mag@@ h@@ re@@ b union to the africa union , south - south cooperation has been continuously enriched , improved and updated both in content and form and in mechanism and strategy .
last year also saw the continuing all - round development of the friendly cooperation between china and canada .
the trade between the two countries kept its growth with a total volume of trade reaching nearly 10 billion u@@ .@@ s . dollars .
high - level contacts were frequent . a group of top canadian officials such as the foreign minister , defense minister , environmental minister and minister for international cooperation , visited china one by one , while china 's supreme court president , minister of commerce and other high - level officials also visited canada . more importantly , the reciprocal visits by the prime ministers of the two countries materi@@ alized .
premier wen ji@@ abao 's recent visit to canada is an important milestone in the history of the two nations . it instil@@ led new vit@@ alities for the further development of the relations between china and canada and laid a solid foundation for the friendly cooperation in various fields between the two countries to further develop both in scope and depth .
china and canada will continue to strengthen their cooperation in politics , economics , culture and education , and science and technology among others and they will strive to double the total bilateral trade volume by 2010 .
my fellow overseas countrymen and friends ,
although you now live overseas , your hearts are always with your hometown . you are very much concerned with the development and progress of your motherland . at each and every crucial juncture , you always share both worries and happiness with the people in your motherland . your lives are linked with that of your motherland .
last year , after some areas in china were hit by s@@ ars and floods , you showed your deep concern and good wishes to the people in your motherland via the internet , letters , telephone and donations , etc. overseas chinese from all walks of life also held a series of large - scale fundraising events and benefit performances . when shen@@ zhou 5 successfully completed its manned space flight , your telephone calls , letters and cards of congratul@@ ation poured in ; everyone was excited and proud about the achievement made by china in space science and technology .
during premier wen ji@@ abao 's visit to canada , hundreds of overseas chinese and students bra@@ ved the winter storm to come to the airport and parliament hill to welcome premier wen ji@@ abao . there were many heart - touching scenes .
now i 'd like to take this opportunity to express my heart - felt gratitude to all of you . i am sure you will continue to make new and greater contributions in this new year to the prosperity of china , the development of china - canada relations , and the complete reunification and rejuvenation of china .
first , to strengthen mutual political trust and deepen strategic cooperation .
as permanent member states of the un security council , both china and france have a significant influence on the international affairs .
both of our countries are in favor of promoting multi - polarization of the world . we advocate the safeguarding of the un authority and are willing to help establish a new international political and economic order that meets the wishes of people in all countries .
both of our countries have extensive consensus and common interests in meeting various challenges facing humanity , and in properly handling major international issues and others .
we are willing to increase our dialogue and consultation with france on major issues such as fighting terrorism , preventing proliferation , cracking down on transnational crimes , promoting common development and strengthening the role of the un ; and to have close cooperation and to be committed to safeguarding the world peace and promoting common development .
second , to strengthen economic and trade cooperation and achieve mutual benefits and complement@@ arity .
as the largest developing country in the world , china is going full steam ahead with its modernization and has a vast market .
france , as a developed country and world leader in economy , science and technology , has cutting - edge technologies in many fields .
the strong complement@@ arity between our two economies promises a great potential for economic and trade cooperation .
since the founding of new china , the chinese government has always placed a great emphasis on developing relations with africa and has formulated a series of guidelines and policies in this respect .
we always adhere to the five principles of peaceful coexistence and respect african countries ' independence and autonomy in their choice of political system and way of development . we provide african countries assistance within our capabilities and carry out economic and technological cooperation . we support the solidarity and cooperation among african countries and their alliance for self empow@@ erment . we urge the international community to pay attention to the peace and development in africa and support the equal participation of african countries in international affairs . we reinforce the consultation and cooperation between china and africa and jointly safeguard the rights and interests of developing countries .
the friendship between china and africa dates back to ancient times and reaches deep into people 's hearts .
since the founding of new china , we have always firmly supported the national liberation cause of africa and provided sincere assistance to the development of national economy in various african countries .
chinese experts , doctors , teachers and workers dispatched to africa work shoulder by shoulder with the people there and get along well with them like real brothers and sisters .
in international affairs , china and african countries understand and support each other and become partners who trust each other .
the chinese people will never forget that at the 26th un assembly in 1971 , it was with the strong support from most developing countries , including various african countries , that china smoothly restored its legitimate seat in the united nations .
in recent years , officials at various levels and in various fields in china and africa have built increasingly deeper mutual political trust . achievements have been made in economic cooperation and trade . the friendly exchanges in culture and education , health , science and technology , sports and other fields are thriving . the china - africa cooperation forum established at the beginning of this century has provided a new platform for the development of china - africa relations and the deepening of cooperation .
as both china and africa have decided to establish a new type of long - term , stable partnership based on equality and mutual benefit , the friendly cooperation between china and africa has entered a new phase of an all - round development .
seven years after ni@@ xon visited china and sino - u@@ .@@ s . shanghai communique was announced , the car@@ ter administration accepted china 's position on the taiwan issue and established diplomatic relations between china and the united states .
this event and deng xia@@ oping 's successful visit to the united states opened a new page in the sino - american relations .
in the early re@@ agan administration , china and the united states had fierce clashes on the taiwan issue .
after painstaking negotiations , the two governments announced the famous august 17 communique in 1982 and reached an agreement on the step - by - step resolution of the arms sales to taiwan .
shanghai communique , the communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations between china and the united states , and the august 17 communique jointly formed the political cornerstone for the sino - u@@ .@@ s . relations .
during the ten years after the establishment of diplomatic relations , although the two countries fought over the taiwan issue and others from time to time , the overall sino - u@@ .@@ s . relations were stable with increasing contact and cooperation in all aspects .
in the 1980s and early 1990s , east europe underwent dramatic transformation . with the dissolution of the soviet union and ending of the cold war , the international situation had experienced the most profound change since world war ii .
the united states took the lead in imposing sanctions against china by announcing the sales of 150 f@@ -@@ 16 fighter jets to taiwan and linking the issue of human rights with the status of the most favorable nation . its permission of lee tung - hui to visit the united states brought the sino - u@@ .@@ s . relations to its lowest level .
with the rapid economic development in china , china 's international status is continuously on the rise .
more and more people in the united states have come to realize that it is in the interest of both china and the united states to improve and develop the sino - u@@ .@@ s . relations .
six months ago , it was also in this hall that we successfully initiated the process of the six - nation talks and set firmly the direction of resolving the nuclear issue peacefully .
in the past half year , all parties held constant talks and negotiations , making ample and in@@ depth preparations for the new round of talks while getting to understand more each other 's position .
now , all parties hope that the second round of talks will address the substantive issues and yield concrete results . all agree to resolve the mutual concerns through coordinated steps ; and all hope to keep the peace process started by the six - nation talks .
these form the important basis for our talks today .
the significance of the second round of talks lies in initiating the discussion of the substantive issues , which shows the process of peace talks takes another new step forward .
this round of talks will cover how to set the concrete goal of resolving the nuclear issue , exploring the first - phase measures of resolving the nuclear issue and studying ways to maintain the process of talks .
as the talks progress further , we will also meet more difficulties and face more challenges , but this is exactly the responsibility history has given us and the hope the international community has placed on us .
here gather we six parties , representative of the strong political wish of seeking peace for the six nations and their peoples .
the objective of our talks is to expand consensus not to highlight dis@@ agreements , to solve problems not to intensify conflicts .
china believes each party , being aware of the peace mission on its shoulders , will take a constructive approach and in the spirit of cooperation and understanding will show mutual respect , demonstrate flexibility and narrow discrepancies .
the second round of six - nation talks in beijing completed the scheduled agenda after more than three days of negoti@@ at@@ ons .
i am thankful to all the governments , all the delegation leaders and staff for their contributions .
if we say the first round of talks set the grand goal of a nuclear - free peninsula , then the significance of this round of talks lies in conducting substantive dialogues and taking a big new step toward realizing the grand goal .
during the talks , all parties conducted in@@ depth and constructive discussions , explored ways and steps of solving the problems with wisdom and rationality , proposed valuable suggestions and made active declaration of policies .
a series of beneficial results have been achieved at the talks . in particular , consensus has been reached on such issues as the next round of talks and the formation of a working group , which are of great importance for pushing forward the process of the peace talks .
dear colleagues , peace and development are the topics of our great time .
the peoples of the six nations , on whose behalf you are here , need peace , long for peace and love peace . peoples of all nations in the world need peace , long for peace and love peace .
in these three days , the international community has been watching beijing and di@@ aoy@@ utai , placing great hopes in this round of talks .
some people may think the talks did not yield enough results and the process did not move fast enough .
my opinion is : this round of talks was started when the relevant parties lacked mutual trust and their differences in positions were widening .
the chinese government has consistently adhered to the basic principle of " peaceful reunification and one country under two systems " on the issue of taiwan .
for this goal , we have tried our best , demonstrated our utmost sincerity and done a great deal of work .
however , our efforts are challenged by taiwan authorities and the forces of " taiwan 's independence . "
we respect the desire of the tai@@ w@@ anese people for democracy , but we oppose the attempts by taiwan authorities and " separatist " forces to pursue taiwan 's independence and cut off taiwan from its motherland in the name of democracy .
the reason why we clearly demonstrate our determination and will to preserve the unity of our motherland is that we want to safeguard the peace and stability across the taiwan strait .
as we have expressed , as long as there is a slim chance of hope , we will work to our utmost to bring about the peaceful reunification of our motherland .
we appreciate president bush 's re@@ it@@ eration of one - china position , which sent a clear signal to the " taiwan 's independence " forces .
taiwan authorities claim : " in order to prevent china from invading taiwan by force and unilaterally changing the status quo across the taiwan strait , we must push for the march 20 peace referendum . "
this is a vil@@ ification of the mainland 's peace efforts as well as a provocation of the cross - strait relations .
at present , the real threat to taiwan 's security does not come from the mainland but from the un@@ bri@@ dled " taiwan 's independence " separatist activities staged by taiwan authorities .
it is none other than the separatist forces that are the direct cause of undermining the status quo in the cross - strait relations and jeopardizing the peace in the taiwan strait .
taiwan authorities distort the chinese mainland 's opposition to " taiwan 's independence " and its preservation of the stability across the taiwan strait as attempts to attack and cr@@ ush the democracy and freedom in taiwan and use them as an excuse to launch the referendum .
this is a grou@@ dless accusation turning the truth upside down and aiming to fraudulently gain sympathy and support for their continuous promotion of separatism .
taiwan authorities claim the upcoming referendum as so called " defensive referendum " and " peace referendum . " yet however packaged , this act of provocation will only increase the cross - strait hostility and hatred , intensifying the cross - strait tension and pushing the cross - strait relations step by step to the brink of danger .
this completely runs counter to taiwan compatriots ' mainstream aspiration for peace , stability and development . instead of deepening " democratization " in taiwan , it mis@@ leads and manipul@@ ates the taiwan people . it is also a serious threat to peace and stability in the asia pacific region and will surely meet with universal opposition by people across the strait and by the international community .
a general review of the historic process of the development of the chinese nation shows that the unification has always been the mainstream . it is where the dominant trend leads and where the heart belongs .
as the motherland grows increasingly stronger and the cross - strait cooperation continues to deepen , the one - china status generally recognized by the international community will stand more solidi@@ fied and any attempt at splittism is doomed to failure .
there are a little over two weeks left before the lunar new year , which is one of the most observed traditional holidays for chinese .
on this j@@ ol@@ ly occasion , we are accustomed to getting together with close relatives and good friends and exchanging gifts to show our hearts .
h@@ ong@@ kong post , in its motto of " linking people , delivering business , " is promoting this " hong kong / mainland gift fulfil@@ ment service " in collaboration with china post to deliver hong kong people 's regards and best wishes to their relatives and customers living in the mainland or in hong kong during the spring festival .
h@@ ong@@ kong post has always been committed to collaboration with its counterparts to provide international fulfil@@ ment service .
as early as december 2002 , it launched foreign wine fulfil@@ ment service jointly with its australian counterpart to provide hong kong residents quality products .
this time we collaborate with china post and further expand our close cooperation long established in the fields of postal affairs , postal remittance , express delivery into cross - border fulfil@@ ment service . it is to meet the increasing market demand of hong kong residents for sending gifts to their relatives or customers in the mainland that we launch this " hong kong / mainland gift fulfil@@ ment service . "
the first batch of gifts includes new year 's gift boxes , which come in different varieties and are exqu@@ is@@ itely packaged . inside the boxes are holiday can@@ dies , tea leaves and dried seafood featuring a great selection to choose from , depending on budget .
they are all ideal gifts either for relatives or friends in the mainland or for business partners .
for three decades , the contribution made by the consumer council to protecting the rights and interests of consumers is evident to all .
there has been no better way to assess the performance of the consumer council than finding out if the rights and interests of consumers have been substantially improved .
i strongly agree with what chairman chen just said . after thirty years , not only consumers have become clearly aware of their own rights and interests , but also their rights and interests are valued by all sectors of society . this is the result of hard work by both the consumer council and the government .
the consumer council tests products periodically , conducts market surveys on various products and services , and studies industrial operations . through its monthly " choice , " it releases fair and objective market information to the public .
the monthly " choice " has won the trust of citizens . now that the monthly " choice " is developing its online version , it will play its role more efficiently in assisting consumers to access market information more conveniently and quickly .
the consumer council has 11 regional consumer consultation centers and 16 hotlines to provide consumers information concerning products and services and take consumers ' complaints .
since the establishment of the consumer council , the number of inquiries it receives has continued to grow , from about a few thousands at the beginning of its establishment in the 1970s up to 14@@ 6,000 inquiries last year . the increase rate of over 20 times shows more and more consumers consult the consumer council 's reports and opinions before choosing products and services .
in addition , the consumer council processed more than 26@@ ,000 complaints this year .
the consumer council also red flags a few individual stores that are un@@ eth@@ ically run , which not only helps consumers guard against fraud but also serves as deterrent to store managers .
legislator yang , on july 1 , i told you i watched tv closely and i later did quite a lot of self examination . i noticed citizens had many complaints and gr@@ ud@@ ges , and were dissatisfied with the performance of the government .
in this respect , the government and i both tried very hard to make improvement during the past six or seven months . when we saw that citizens demanded for improvement of economy and life , we also worked very hard toward that . when we knew that citizens had many complaints about article 23 of the " basic law , " we took article 23 out . the government indeed responded immediately .
as for the social appeal for democracy , i also understand it clearly .
however , legislator yang , i want to tell you that what i am doing today is exactly to ensure that everything can be done smoothly once the review of the constitutional development starts . therefore , some basic problems must be solved first . these are totally two different things .
what are the basic problems ?
some are problems of principle , while others are problems concerning law , involving the interpretation of some articles about the review of constitutional development in the " basic law . " we must do some work on this first .
we are now working on this part . a three - person task force has already started to do this work .
it will consult the central government and will also take s@@ oundings in hong kong . i think this is a very good step . it is a decision we made because we value the public opinion in hong kong .
in today 's highly competitive commercial environment , the brand name plays a crucial role in the success of a product .
to create a brand name takes more than a single day . it requires a creative design , premium quality , thoughtful packaging , effective marketing and sustained investment .
hong kong has the making of a brand name .
we have relevant knowledge , skills and experience , and a gal@@ axy of talent from designing , manufacturing , marketing to management . in addition we have a vast market .
the cep@@ a which just went into effect will add to our advantages . in addition to its preferential treatment of zero tariffs for acc@@ essing the mainland market , the best of cep@@ a lies in motiv@@ ating businesspeople to find ways to increase the added value of their products so that they become popular brand names in hong kong , the mainland and even in the world .
the voting of " hong kong top ten brand names " by the chinese manufacturers ' association of hong kong happens to be based on the same idea as the cep@@ a 's promotion of developing value - added hong kong products .
over five years , this voting has created 51 " hong kong top ten brand names . "
however , in the vast market of the mainland , 51 brand names amount to almost nothing . we need " hong kong top brand names " by the hundred , the thousand , and even more .
for years , hong kong 's m@@ tr@@ c has been participating in the subway projects in the major cities of mainland china , bringing its rich experience in hong kong to the mainland market by means of service .
i am very pleased that hong kong 's investment , professional services and the quality of management personnel have been recognized in the mainland market .
such exchanges between shenzhen and hong kong not only help the development of the motherland but also provide hong kong businesspeople more opportunities for development . they do more than boost economy as they also provide more job opportunities for hong kong .
it is with the help of supportive policies of the central government , the government of shenzhen special economic zone and many others that we have reached an agreement in principle on this project . i hereby extend my great thanks .
for the first time , the m@@ tr@@ c has gone beyond hong kong to participate in the development of the mainland subways through investments and bring even more hong kong brand names to the mainland . this is indeed something that people in hong kong and mainland should feel happy about .
i hereby wish for an early official approval from the central government for line 4 of shenzhen metr@@ o system and for a smooth construction of the project so that a stronger foundation will be laid for more exchange and cooperation between shenzhen and hong kong in the future .
today is january 5 of the lunar new year . i am very happy to be invited by the chinese gold & silver exchange society to attend your group exchange of new year greetings and to host the opening ceremony of the gold market for the new year .
first of all , let me extend my greeting to each of you and wish you all be energetic , lucky , prosperous , and successful in the year of the monkey .
in the past year the price of gold rose dramatically . recently it even exceeded the level of 400 u@@ .@@ s . dollar per ounce . the sustained strong rise reflects investors ' renewed confidence in gold .
i believe my colleagues must have also had a good business last year .
in fact , the thriving market owes as much to the external factors as to the successful management of the gold & silver exchange society for more than 90 years of hard work .
the hard work has not only laid a solid foundation for the gold market in hong kong but also contributed even more to the consolidation of hong kong 's position as an international financial center .
as the old saying goes that " make your plan for the year in spring , " i hope all my colleagues at the gold & silver exchange society will continue to work hard in the coming year , seize the " golden " time of the gold and silver industry , take hold of the demand for gold trade brought about by the gold market reform in the mainland , china 's accession to the w@@ to and cep@@ a , and further promote the market development .
i believe that with my colleagues ' active promotion , the gold market in hong kong will surely have brilliant performance in the coming year .
finally , let me wish for a very prosperous year of the monkey for the gold market , all industries and businesses .
thank you very much .
however , the challenges in the past were not limited to government - funded public housing . private housing was also greatly challenged .
the financial crisis in 1997 led to the burst of assets bubble . as a result , real estate prices plunged by 70 % , hitting property owners really hard . this was also the main reason that deflation was aggravated several times over the past five years .
now that economy is turning around , we are determined to maintain a stable environment and ensure the real estate market will continue its steady growth .
a healthy real estate market is indeed of crucial importance to the continuous recovery of hong kong 's economy .
we are also devoted to protecting and improving our living environment .
our future efforts should be based on the principle of sustainable development . we will improve our living environment through more proper urban design and better protection of natural and cultural heritage in hong kong .
we will double our attention to the issue of overall environment .
the lesson we learned from the s@@ ars outbreak in hong kong last year reminds us that we must make every effort to create a more spacious , cleaner and healthier living environment .
we will provide better landscaping and more green@@ ery ; and add parks and leisure and recreational facilities for the benefit of the community .
many council members have expressed their opinions on the sections concerning legislature and law , political system , civil servants and government - funded public service employees , and security in the chief executive 's " policy address , " and i hereby extend my appreciation to them .
only council@@ woman marg@@ aret ng and council@@ man ts@@ ang y@@ ok - sing have spoken about the subjects of the judicial and legal services . they are chair and vice chair of judicial and legal affairs committee of the legislative council .
the chief executive put forward many measures to promote people - based governance such as increasing contact of key officials with the public , conducting more studies on public policy , strengthening the cooperation between the government and the legislative council and carrying out serious reviews of the constitutional development .
department of justice will fully participate in the aforementioned work and ensure all government measures comply with laws and procedures and in particular with the " basic law , " including the basic civil rights and freedom it protects . in the meantime , the department will keep vigilance as council@@ woman ng said to safeguard the independence of the rule of law and the judiciary in hong kong .
as a chief officer , i will certainly try my best to understand the opinions of the general public and the legal community on the issues that affect judicial affairs and legal profession .
for example , cep@@ a is a product of the close cooperation among the government and the business community , including hong kong bar association , the law society of hong kong and the association of china appointed att@@ esting officers l@@ t@@ d .
we have successfully included " legal services " in the cep@@ a and made it one of the service industries opened by the mainland . this has provided a new platform for stepping up the cooperation in legal services between the two sides and will bring macro and long - term benefits to the legal services on both sides .
the work of the task force is bi@@ directional . we will report to the central government about what we did taking s@@ oundings in hong kong .
from mid - january of this year up till now , we have interviewed about a dozen of groups and individuals .
all of them fully accept that the constitutional development in hong kong needs to comply with " one country , two systems , " and that hong kong sar is under the direct jurisdiction of the central government .
most of them believe that the constitutional system of hong kong needs improvement ; yet at the same time they also accept that any development must be within the framework of the " basic law . "
the groups and individuals also have their own opinions on a few procedural and legal issues .
the task force will fully convey these wishes , views and statements of opinion of theirs to the central government .
in the coming month or so , the task force will continue to interview other groups and individuals and we will forward the opinions we receive successively to the central government .
today 's meeting is only the first one the task force has with the relevant agency of the central government ; and we will still need to continue our follow - up and exchange of views with the central government .
i believe everybody understands that the development of the constitutional system involves the relations between the central government and the sar ; that the central government also has the constitutional right and responsibility to review the constitutional development in the sar and that we need to fully consult with the central government .
west k@@ ow@@ loon cultural district is a large - scale cultural and arts project hong kong has never undertaken before . it is not only a project that provides our residents with a space for cultural and art pursuits , recreation and entertainment , but also a project to raise the qualities of the urban life and its residents .
the construction of west k@@ ow@@ loon cultural district entails the participation of the entire hong kong community .
the government must continue working with people from all walks of life for exploration in more depth and collect wisdom from a wide range of sources .
we understand that we cannot pursue es@@ thetic beauty of the architecture alone . we must also make the project capable of generating economical benefits , sustaining development and raising the quality of life of urban residents .
therefore , the government attaches great importance to support services for west k@@ ow@@ loon cultural district . they must work in conjunction with relevant measures , including the management policies on the facilities , promotion tactics for the cultural programs , contents of performances and exhibitions , advertising tactics , etc.
the formulation of these relevant tactics must be carefully based on the opinions of the " users . "
the young generation , including every young friend present here , will be one of the major types of users of west k@@ ow@@ loon cultural district in the future .
it is our hope that people , young and old , with refined or popular taste , can all enjoy this district . it will be such a place of attraction that both hong kong residents and tourists from other places , mature adults or lively youth , will love to stay forever .
i know you held a discussion on several different aspects of west k@@ ow@@ loon cultural district this morning . some students even spent a lot of time and energy in the past month or so preparing the special reports . i am sure you are already very familiar with the details of the project .
i just could not wait to hear the result of your discussion and hope i can exchange opinions with you .
since the sep@@ t. 11 terrorist attacks , the global attention has focused on the security at se@@ ap@@ orts , airports and borders .
as the port of origin in the world that ships the largest number of containers to the united states , hong kong undoubtedly responded promptly to the " container security initiative " put forward by the united states .
in addition , we believe that cutting off the life line of terrorist groups can also be an effective measure to stop terrorist activities .
every day , large sums of funds flowing in and out of the global financial system have always puzzled the law enforcement agencies that target criminal profit - making and money laundering .
as a key financial center in asia , we believe cutting off funds of terrorists may be the most effective way to destroy their network from its very foundation .
at present , hong kong 's legislative body is discussing various proposals for improvement so as to tighten the existing laws and regulations that aim at cracking down on terrorist funding . it is also amending laws and regulations in active compliance with the international standards and situation such as the new proposal by the financial action task force on money laundering .
besides , we are also trying to draw up a better information disclosure law to make it easier for agencies and individuals to report suspicious transactions .
" balance " is also the key in this job : valid investigation right , freedom and personal privacy protected by the constitution , and efficiency of economic and financial systems are all factors that must be considered .
our regulatory measures are based on the rule of law , transparency , fairness and efficiency .
in fact , the service sector in hong kong has advantages in many aspects .
professionals and commercial service personnel in hong kong have a deep understanding of the business operations both in mainland china and the rest of the world .
professional services in hong kong like accounting , finance , law , arbitration , etc. are the best partners for the mainland businesses in their globalization and getting in line with the world market .
our transport , construction , designing and market promotion , management consulting , information science and technology , conventions and exhibitions and other services , on the other hand , can help enhance the overall productivity and competitiveness of the mainland enterprises and assist them in developing strategies for market promotion of products and improving brand images .
services like tourism , healthcare and insurance can all the more assist in the development of the related markets and industries in the mainland and improve their quality of service .
the close cooperation between service industries in hong kong and the mainland will greatly enhance the existing advantages each has now and help both in taking the opportunities and challenges brought about by the economic globalization .
in order to promote the development of professional service industries in the mainland market , secretary for finance and i , together with officials from the policy bureaux and administration division and several representatives from different professional industries , just had substantive and valuable discussions in beijing last week on mutual recognition of professional qualifications and other topics of interest to the business community with the relevant departments and counterpart industries in the mainland .
i am very pleased that we have taken the first important step toward the business development of the mainland market by signing the agreements on mutual recognition of qualifications and cooperation in the three professional industries of construction , structural engineering and insurance .
through this meeting , the professional industries in hong kong have also established closer relations with the regulatory agencies in the mainland and laid a good foundation for the friendly cooperation in the next stage .
i believe the great majority of hong kong citizens love the motherland and love hong kong .
in fact , either before or after its return to china , hong kong has always had very close and inter@@ dependent economic , social , political and cultural ties with the mainland .
in the economic field , hong kong � s industry has had a chance to move north and gained new space for development since our country instituted the four modernization programs , implemented reforms and the opening up more than two decades ago . this , as we can see , has brought hong kong community into closer touch with the mainland .
recently , we have another chance to make an arrangement with the central government for closer economic and trade relations so that various service sectors in hong kong can have new opportunities to participate more actively and more extensively in the economic development in the mainland and to make a new round of contributions to our country and hong kong . this will also bring hong kong and the mainland closer together .
in social development , we see the country has been making phenomen@@ al progress in recent years .
hong kong citizens were very excited when they saw beijing � s successful bid for hosting the 2008 oly@@ mpic games .
a few months earlier , they were equally excited when yang we@@ ili paid a visit to hong kong . why is so ?
because we think everybody , every hong kong citizen should feel proud for such achievement made by our country .
i know that legislative council started to discuss with the government about the site of the permanent office of legislative council as early as ten years ago .
likewise , the government has also been pondering over the long - term plan of relocating the government headquarters for more than a decade .
therefore , i understand the government 's decision to postpone the tam@@ ar project which includes the new legislative council complex will certainly dis@@ appoint some of the legislators .
i know that the legislators will have to suffer some inconvenience by continuing to work in a less than satisfactory place for this period of time .
however , just as i said to my colleagues in the government who are also affected by this decision , i hope everybody can give priority to public interests , understand the factors involved and exercise more patience during this period .
earlier i explained many times to the legislative council commission that after considering the current fiscal situation and the financial status in the wake of the s@@ ars outbreak last year , the government does not consider it an appropriate time now to proceed with the tam@@ ar project or any large - scale office building project .
postp@@ oning the project of the new legislative council complex at tam@@ ar will help reduce the financial pressure on the government in the coming years . it is in the public interests and is also accepted by the public .
the government will resume the project of developing the new legislative council complex at tam@@ ar as soon as public finances improve . our current plan will do so .
our country cares very much about hong kong . so do the chairman and the premier . i know they and the central government will make every effort to do a good job in this area .
so , good news will come in succession from tourism , finance , infrastructure coordination , freedom traffic rights , zero - tariff on products and service industry .
i also sincerely hope that with its economic recovery , hong kong can capit@@ alize more on its advantages to make greater contribution to the development of our country .
when i met premier wen ji@@ abao , i , on behalf of hong kong , also congratulated him on the admirable achievement our country made under his leadership during the past difficult year . although many challenges lie ahead , he is full of confidence as you have all heard from his work report . we are all very much encouraged by that .
premier wen also told me that reviewing m@@ r. deng xia@@ oping 's important remarks on " one country , two systems " 20 years ago is of great significance for us to have a complete and accurate understanding of the principle of " one country , two systems , " which will be very helpful for the constitutional development in the future .
he also told me that people of hong kong should really seize this opportunity to focus on economic development and improvement on living standards . he is full of confidence in hong kong .
later i will meet with m@@ r. zhang de@@ jiang , secretary of guangdong provincial party committee , and governor huang hua@@ hua , to discuss with them how to push our cooperation to a higher level and create a bigger win - win situation based on our current achievements .
the last point is the notion of " hong kong governed by the people of hong kong " that everybody has become familiar with recently . this system requires that hong kong be governed by the people of hong kong , the majority of whom are patriots .
there are also clear - cut standards for being patriots . they should be those people of hong kong who respect their own nation , sincerely support the restoration of our country 's sovereignty over hong kong and refrain from doing anything detrimental to our country and hong kong . it is these patriots that make the majority of the government who should govern hong kong .
i must reiterate that the people of hong kong as a whole are patriotic .
what is referred to here is not the ordinary hong kong citizens but those individuals who participate in the management of public affairs in hong kong and hold key positions in the administrative body , the legislative council and the judicial branch .
when they are sworn into office , they must show their support for the " basic law " of hong kong sar of the people 's republic of china in accordance with the " basic law " and pledge their allegiance to the hong kong sar of the people 's republic of china .
the above five or six principles and their serious considerations i have talked about are actually the set of long - term guidelines and policies that had been set forth as early as in the 1980s when people started to talk about the distant future of hong kong , worked on " the joint declaration " and finalized the " basic law . " it has so far remained unchanged and will never be changed . since it is a series of long - term guidelines and policies governing our country � s restoration of sovereignty over hong kong and it is our state policy , it will never be changed .
several hundred years after its establishment , especially since the industrial revolution , the system of intellectual property has brought forth a succession of major inventions of epoch - breaking significance .
in the recent two decades , the system of intellectual property has become the basic legal system and important policy and measure for various countries in promoting technological innovation and has played a key role in boosting their economy and enhancing their international competitiveness .
at present , with the rapid development of science and technology and economic globalization , the quantity and quality of intellectual property ownership as well as the creation , possession and application of knowledge and intellectual resources have become the important foundation for all countries in participating in the international competitions .
therefore , stepping up the international exchange and cooperation in intellectual property protection is of great importance to the establishment of a just and reasonable new international economic order , and to the promotion of the global economic prosperity and development .
the chinese government lays great emphasis on intellectual property protection .
our country started to establish the system of intellectual property in the early stage of our reform and opening up . after more than two decades of hard work , we have developed a relatively complete legal system of intellectual property and established a system of intellectual property protection which combines both judicial and executive branches . we have done a great deal of work in the area of intellectual property protection and made an important contribution to the progress of science and technology and economic and social development .
as the world entered the information age in the 21st century , science and technology will promote the development of man � s productivity with unprecedented force .
for our country to expand opening up to the outside world in the new century , it is necessary to further improve our system of intellectual property and strengthen international exchange and cooperation in intellectual property protection . it is also necessary for the construction of a modern socialist country and the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation .
we are willing to work together with various countries in the world to establish a system of intellectual property , which is just , reasonable and conducive to the promotion of science and technology and economic development in all countries , and to create a good environment in which all the people respect knowledge , advocate science and protect intellectual property .
the most important task for shanghai cooperation organization now is to speed up the institution@@ alization of the organization .
thanks to efforts by all parties , great progress has been made in the preparation for the set - up of the secretariat and a regional anti - terrorism agency .
we will re@@ double our efforts to ensure that the secretariat start its official operation within this year and the regional anti - terrorism agency be set up as soon as possible .
to show that it takes sc@@ o seriously , the chinese government , as a hosting nation for organizing the secretariat , has decided to provide the secretariat free offices .
in the future , we will also continue to provide strong support for the smooth operation of the secretariat .
it has always been the sc@@ o 's focus of work to deepen and promote security cooperation .
we will be always on guard against the " three forces " that have done serious harm to the interests of all member countries in the region and will never allow them to have their way .
we should make un@@ rel@@ enting efforts on a long - term basis to eradicate these evil forces so as to effectively safeguard the security and stability in the region .
in order to cut off the financial sources for the activities of the " three forces " and combat these " three forces " more completely and effectively , we should put the issue of fighting drug trafficking on the agenda of the security cooperation as soon as possible .
economic cooperation is the important foundation and priori@@ tized direction for the sc@@ o .
education is the cornerstone of the modern civilization .
to enhance the overall quality of the people in our country and increase total national capabilities , education must be vigorously promoted .
rural education has a wide range of impact and affects the overall rural economy and social development .
since the reform and opening up , tremendous and profound changes have taken place in both cities and rural areas in our country . this owes a great deal to the education , especially the rural education .
the implementation in rural areas of the family contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output has greatly liberated the productive forces .
one of the underlying reasons why advanced and practical farming technologies can be extensively applied , why rural enterprises can suddenly emerge as a new force , and why the surplus labor in rural areas can have a massive migration to the coastal areas and towns and cities is that they are all backed by a rural labor force of hundreds of millions of people who have received obligatory education . credit should be given to universal obligatory education in rural areas .
at present , the agriculture and rural economy in our country are in a crucial stage of development . the development of high quality , high efficient , ec@@ ologically - friendly and safe agriculture , the expansion of industrialized agriculture and the relocation of rural surplus labor force all make it an urgent need to fully raise the overall qualification of rural labor force .
the emergence in the world of a revolution in new science and technology and the progress made in building an overall well - to - do society have raised higher demands for the scientific , cultural , ideological and moral qualifications of the vast majority of rural population .
without the implementation of universal compulsory 9th grade education in rural areas and comprehensive enhancement of qualification of peasants , it would be very hard to realize an overall well - to - do society .
we must fully recognize that rural education constitutes a fundamental , prec@@ urs@@ ory and integral part of our efforts to building an overall well - to - do society .
among the advisors and distinguished guests who attend this conference are famous top leaders of multinational corporations , world renowned economists and accomplished experts and scholars .
i am deeply touched by the sincere cooperation and the active and pragmatic approach demonstrated by all the advisors .
bringing our cooperation and collective wisdom into full play not only helps in planning and promoting the development of guangdong but also helps our concerted efforts in promoting cooperation and development in all fields .
i had been looking forward to the 2003 international consultation conference on economic development of guangdong so that i can listen to and learn about your valuable advice on the economic and social development of guangdong .
we are happily gathering here today to pursue one common goal : to strengthen cooperation and exchange , seek more space for development , inf@@ use new vit@@ alities into the economic and social development of guangdong and create opportunities for the development of your businesses .
china 's accession to the w@@ to marks a brand new phase of the opening up to the outside world as we are participating in the international competition in broader areas , more extensive fields and at higher levels .
as a province with the highest degree of overseas - oriented economy in the mainland , guangdong has been the first to experience the unprecedented opportunities for development and to meet the accompanying harsh challenges .
against such a backdrop , we must seize new opportunities and meet new challenges , enhance our international competitiveness in all aspects and actively proceed with the modernization programs . we must strive to open up new prospects for economic cooperation so as to achieve common development through long - term , mutually complementary and beneficial cooperation .
the people of guangdong are focused on building an overall well - to - do society and accelerating their efforts for modernization , which will create more opportunities and room for development for all our friends .
the economy of guangdong , thriving with vitality and broad prospects , is rising vigorously to new heights .
recently , iraq 's interim governing council and the u@@ .@@ s . occupying authorities signed an agreement in bag@@ hdad , announcing a timetable for a step - by - step transfer of power to hand over the government back to iraq by june next year .
this agreement was reluctantly approved by the international community : although the meeting of the eu foreign ministers welcomed the move , france considered " the process too slow ; " while ann@@ an , the un secretary general , felt encouraged about this plan of power transfer , he said " it � s still premature " for the united nations to play its role in iraq ; russia , on the other hand , flat@@ ly contested the legitimacy of the agreement .
the ira@@ q@@ is gave a cold response ; public opinions in the united states even consider it " a big gamble . "
in short , most people are still somewhat skeptical and choose to wait and see .
it is not without reason that the international community has so many doubts .
as people see it , the united states is not returning power to iraq out of its own accord . it is therefore impossible to have a complete transfer of power and there are bound to be many unexpected developments .
first , the interim transitional government set to be established in may next year is not to be directly elected by the ira@@ qi people but will be elected by the " transitional national assembly " that is selected by 18 govern@@ orate selection ca@@ uc@@ uses .
this will be hard to be free from suspicion of the u@@ .@@ s . control and its legitimacy may be questioned .
second , the united states has already announced that it will not withdraw its military forces after handing over the power . it will merely change the original " military occupation " to " military presence . "
the u@@ .@@ s . government announced on november 18 that it had decided to impose quotas on three types of textile imports from china , namely : kn@@ it fabric , br@@ assi@@ eres and dressing g@@ owns .
at a time when china is continuing its efforts to expand the economic and trade cooperation between china and the united states , it is deeply regrettable that the u@@ .@@ s . government should take this measure of trade protectionism .
at this phase of economic globalization , the new quotas the united states imposes on china � s textile imports are out of accord with the times .
first , this abuse of " quotas " hin@@ ders the implementation of the w@@ to 's principle of free trade .
isn � t it too arbitrary and unfair to give pom@@ p@@ ous talks on � free trade � while back@@ st@@ abbing others with � quotas � at every opportunity in order to rebuild trade barriers ?
second , " quotas " set a cap on the trend of development toward wholesome economic and trade relations between china and the united states .
since china and the united states reached an agreement in 1999 on china 's accession to the w@@ to , the u@@ .@@ s . exports to china have enjoyed an average annual increase of 15 % .
from january to september this year , u@@ .@@ s . exports to china increased by 2@@ 6.2 % over the same period of the preceding year .
in the past two years , u@@ .@@ s . exports of raw materials for textiles and finished products to china have risen sharply .
in fact , china today has become a country to which the u@@ .@@ s . exports have enjoyed the fastest growth among all the countries in the world .
there are many reasons why bush 's visit to the u@@ .@@ k . did not accomplish its goal . the most important one is that after the cold war was over , the united states has become the only superpower in the world , which has led to its total disregard of others and excessive unilater@@ alism .
the united states launched the war on iraq without the un authorization . with no respect for the opinions of its chief allies on major international issues such as the rebuilding of iraq , the united states persists in its own ways and has thus rou@@ sed everybody � s fur@@ y .
a poll survey recently released by the eu commission shows that 68 % of the eu citizens think the united states did not have adequate justification to launch the war on iraq and 53 % believe the united states now poses a threat to the world peace .
second , although the united states lays emphasis on fighting terrorism and wants its allies to contribute human and financial resources , it turns a deaf ear to their concerns .
with a firm hold on iraq 's reconstruction projects , the united states gave major contracts in the first bid to the corporations in its own country , unwilling to share even a tiny piece of the pie with others . as for the dispute on the steel trade , the w@@ to ruled that the united states ' high tariffs have violated the regulations . people in the u@@ .@@ k . business circles had hoped bush might make concessions during this visit , yet the united states eventually failed to clearly state its position .
third , the united states put its own values as supreme guidelines above those of all other nations . its insistence that middle east countries carry out democratic reforms has been c@@ ensured . some allies request that the united states respect the culture and special features of isl@@ amic countries . they believe that one of the reasons that the united states is deeply bogged down in iraq is exactly the dire consequence of its " dis@@ respect . "
however , bush will not change his ways just because of the widespread criticism and opposition . during this visit , he again defended his iraq policy and emphasized that the u@@ .@@ s . - british coalition forces will continue to use force to deal with the violence in iraq .
since bush 's visit to the u@@ .@@ k . failed to accomplish its goal , the situation in iraq will not necessarily develop the way the white house hopes for .
after more than six months of debate , an advance contingent of japan 's self - defense forces finally headed for iraq before the end of 2003 .
this is the first time since the end of world war ii that japan has sent troops to overseas battlefields .
it reflects the will of japan in becoming a political and military power and also signals a shift in its defense strategy .
the reason why this trip of the s@@ d@@ f has drawn so much attention is that it is not an isolated case .
taking advantage of the war in af@@ gh@@ anistan , japan made the breakthrough of letting the s@@ d@@ f go outside japan . by using the problem in the korean peninsula as an excuse , japan passed the " crisis legislation , " making preparations for the s@@ d@@ f 's use of force or even pre@@ emptive strikes . recently , the ko@@ izumi cabinet again passed " the basic plan for ira@@ qi reconstruction assistance , " paving the way for the military dispatch to iraq .
step by step , this finally led to the breakthrough of the restriction of japan 's pac@@ if@@ ist constitution and military deployment to overseas battlefields .
in addition , japan is also going to amend " concept of basic defense force " so that military deployment overseas can be made legal and permanent . it also plans to establish a " regular force " for overseas deployment that is not formed on contingency .
meanwhile , the japanese cabinet meeting , citing the so - called " threat of north korea 's missiles � as a reason , decided to start the deployment of the missile defense system by early 2004 . it imports the u@@ .@@ s . - made " standard 3 missiles " and " patri@@ ot pac@@ -3 " missiles to intercept ex@@ o@@ atmospheric missiles and those returning to the atmosphere in order to build a two - ti@@ ered missile interception network .
it is easy to see that japan 's s@@ d@@ f is evolving into a regular military force " for offensive as well as defensive purposes . " it seems that the so - called " s@@ d@@ f " " exclusively for defensive purposes " is going to exist in name only .
the reason why these actions by japan have drawn so much attention is mainly because these military decisions are a challenge to japan � s pac@@ if@@ ist constitution .
after his visit to the ya@@ su@@ kuni shrine , ko@@ izumi defended his action in an interview with japanese reporters .
his defense was self - contradictory and full of loopholes .
when asked by reporters why he visited the shrine , ko@@ izumi replied : " the peace and prosperity in japan are built upon the sacrifices of the war .
the purpose of my visit is to pray for peace and prosperity of japan . "
we would like to ask whether ko@@ izumi 's so - called " sacrifices of the war " include class a world war ii criminals such as hi@@ de@@ ki to@@ jo .
does it mean class a war criminals also made their fundamental contribution to the peace and prosperity in the post - war japan ?
some reporter asked why january 1 was chosen for his visit to the ya@@ su@@ kuni shrine .
ko@@ izumi said it is the japanese tradition to go to worship at the shrine on the first day of the new year and many people pay a visit to the shrine on this day .
it is understandable that ordinary people mour@@ n for their loved ones and friends , and many survivors clearly expressed their opinion that their visit to the shrine is only for the purpose of rememb@@ ering their loved ones and friends and that they strongly oppose hon@@ oring class a war criminals at the ya@@ su@@ kuni shrine .
the chinese are a reasonable people . we have always insisted on differenti@@ ating the japanese people from a handful of militarists and the ordinary public from the right wing . ordinary people 's visit to the ya@@ su@@ kuni shrine is not the root cause of this historical issue .
in unity there is strength .
this is an indisputable truth .
in order to realize the grand goal of building an overall well - to - do society and accomplish the sacred mission of rejuvenating the chinese nation , we must unite all the forces that we can unite .
this must be the basic starting point and the closing point for the operations of the patriotic united front and the chinese people 's political consultative conference in the new phase of this new century .
we must further adhere to and perfect the system of the multi - party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the chinese communist party , further consolidate and develop the patriotic united front , mobilize all the positive factors to the fullest extent possible , and continue to add new strength to the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation .
in the past year , the cppcc , with solidarity and democracy as its firm focuses , diligently performed all its due functions and played an important role in promoting the all - round economic and social development of our country and in maintaining a stable overall environment for the progress of reforms .
in this new year , we hope that the cppcc will center its work around the party and the government and further its efforts in political consultation , democratic supervision , participating in politics and political discussions , promoting its fine traditions , taking full advantage of its own superi@@ orities , conducting investigations and studies at a deeper level , and actively giving advice and proposals so as to make new and greater contribution to the building of an overall well - to - do society .
from january 4 to january 6 , the 12th summit of the south asian association for regional cooperation (@@ sa@@ arc@@ ) , which had been postponed for an entire year , was held in isl@@ am@@ abad . the summit passed " framework treaty for saf@@ ta , " " additional protocol to sa@@ ar@@ c anti - terrorism convention , " " south asia social charter " and other documents , declaring the commitment of sa@@ ar@@ c member nations to the common development and cooperation in economic , cultural and anti - terrorism and other fields .
during the sa@@ ar@@ c summit , the bilateral meeting between indian prime minister v@@ aj@@ payee and pak@@ istani president mus@@ har@@ raf drew special attention .
the hand@@ shake at the last summit between mus@@ har@@ raf and v@@ aj@@ payee did not bring too much expectation on the development of relations between the two countries .
two years later , as both sides took a series of major steps such as restoration of normal diplomatic relations , air and land transport links , and the successful cease - fire in the kash@@ mir region , the relations between india and pakistan continued to ease and this eventually led to the top - level meeting at this sa@@ ar@@ c summit .
as the two countries took another major step toward improving bilateral relations , the cooperation in south asia is arriving at the new turning point for development .
although indian foreign minister sin@@ ha said on the 4th that this meeting was � for courtesy , � people believe the meeting means the india - pakistan relations will continue to be adjusted toward a more positive and pragmatic direction .
the leaders of the two countries have both realized that tension and confrontation go against the interests of their own respective country and only make them lose one opportunity after another in economic development .
with further development in globalization , strengthening the cooperation and revitalizing the economy have now become top priorities for the governments of both countries .
although the result of the presidential election held on the 4th in ge@@ or@@ gia has not yet been officially announced , the victory of sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i , the national movement leader who is a candidate jointly nominated by the right - wing political parties , is a fore@@ gone conclusion .
ge@@ or@@ gia 's central election commission announced on the 7th that based on the statistics of 89 % of votes , more than 95 % of voters supported sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i .
some heads of state from the commonwealth of independent states have also sent messages of congratul@@ ation to this young politician .
in fact , sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i already declared his own victory as early as the very night after the election was over .
he called the result " the victory of the people , " and said that ge@@ or@@ gia will act promptly to create a new future .
when interviewed by the news media , many voters said that casting votes for sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i means choosing " a new hope . "
even the former president sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ nad@@ ze who was forced to resign also expressed his support for this former political opponent by praising him as " young , energetic and well - educated . "
while placing their hope on sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i , people also noticed that not many changes have taken place in ge@@ or@@ gia in the two months since sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ nad@@ ze resigned .
in other words , what the president - elect has to face will still be the old problems .
the past year was a significant and extraordinary one in the development of our country .
we fought an extremely tough battle against the sudden epidemic of s@@ ars and won a brilliant victory for that phase . meanwhile , our economic development has maintained its excellent momentum and the average g@@ d@@ p per capita reached a new level of over 1,000 u@@ .@@ s . dollars . with the success of shen@@ zhou 5 manned space flight , the dream of space flight by the chinese nation has become a reality . we have enjoyed ethnic solidarity and social progress and people � s livelihood is further improving .
the achievements made by our country in various fields are widely noticed by the world . for these achievements , the people of the whole country have contributed a great deal of work , demonstrating their fear@@ lessness for hardships and risks , and courage and strength to create miracles .
we are full of confidence and hope for the new year .
the current situation both in china and abroad offers our country an important strategic opportunity that we must grasp for great accomplishments .
we will continue to use deng xia@@ oping theory and the important thought of � three represents � as our guideline and fully implement the spirit of the party 's 16th congress and the 3rd plenary session of the 16th cpc central committee . we must conscientiously carry out the general guidelines and overall deployment set forth by the central party committee on this year � s work and continue to push forward the reform and opening up as well as the modernization drive .
to do a good job for this year , we should make a correct assessment of the situation by identifying both favorable conditions and new opportunities on the one hand and unfavorable conditions and new challenges on the other . we should also heighten our sense of responsibility and urgency and awareness of potential adver@@ si@@ ties .
the three - party talks on issues of iraq were held on the 19th in the un headquarters in new york city . ann@@ an , the un secretary general , held discussions with representatives from iraq 's interim governing council and the u@@ .@@ s . - british coalition provisional authority with the focus on how the united nations can play its role in rebuilding iraq .
the talks covered such issues as politics , humanitarian aids , security in iraq and the appointment of the un special representative to iraq , upon which the three parties exchanged their opinions in a candid manner .
at a time when the u@@ .@@ s . - british plan of transfer of power to iraq is facing boycott , whether or how the united nations will get involved in rebuilding iraq certainly draws much attention .
since the united states declared the end of major combat in iraq in early may last year , the situation in iraq has remained prec@@ arious . attacks against the occupation forces were frequent , infl@@ icting heavy casualties on the u@@ .@@ s . - british coalition forces that have enjoyed little l@@ ull of peace .
the former ira@@ qi president s@@ addam was captured on december 13 last year , but the u@@ .@@ s . e@@ uph@@ oria did not last long . security remained un@@ improved and resistance escalated , throwing the occupying authority into a dilemma .
on the other hand , the ira@@ qi people and arab countries are unanimously demanding the pull - out of foreign troops and the return of power to ira@@ q@@ is so as to let the ira@@ qi people govern their own country .
meanwhile , the united states and britain are trying hard to res@@ ha@@ pe the ira@@ qi government according to their own will , through which they plan to gradually and " gr@@ ace@@ fully " extricate themselves from the dilemma .
therefore , the method and process of the power transfer have become the focus of the current ira@@ qi affairs .
the tentative plan of power transfer as proposed by the coalition provisional authority and iraq 's interim governing council last november is that the ira@@ qi interim transitional government to be formed by july 1 this year will be elected by the " transitional national assembly , " but the delegates to the assembly shall be selected and appointed by " govern@@ orate selection ca@@ uc@@ uses . "
whereas , the shi@@ ites that make up the majority of ira@@ qi population stress that for a truly fair transfer of power to iraq , a national direct election should be held .
u@@ .@@ s . secretary of state pow@@ ell 's recent visit to russia remains a focus of widespread public opinion .
this is partly due to the fact that the mutual relations between the united states and russia , the two decisive powers , can have profound and far - reaching impact on the present world .
more importantly , pow@@ ell 's visit to moscow is very substantive and sends a clear signal that dark clouds are lo@@ oming over the relations between the united states and russia .
if these dark clouds are not dispersed in time , the prospects of the bilateral relations may not be optimistic .
despite the smooth and open channel of dialogue between washington and moscow , pow@@ ell decided to clarify his position in an article in iz@@ v@@ esti@@ a , a very influential newspaper in russia .
pow@@ ell pointed out in his article that the united states was puzzled by a series of events in russia 's internal affairs and diplomatic arena in recent months .
in his opinion , the political power in russia is not yet fully te@@ thered to law and the key elements of a civil society such as freedom of the press and development of political parties are not solidly established .
russia � s policy on ch@@ echnya and its attitude toward its neighboring countries in the commonwealth of independent states have caused all the more concerns from the united states .
to diplomats , using the mass media for a public statement of position is the " last resort " of communications .
the original intention of the united states in making such a choice is thought - provoking as it is clear that russia is embarrassed and dis@@ pleased with this choice .
with the advent of a new century , economic globalization has become a major and serious challenge to african countries .
the leaders of african countries have realized more and more clearly that africa cannot afford to allow another opportunity to slip by and must actively seek ways to deal with the situation .
on july 9, 2002 , the african union was officially established and started operation . since then , the african countries , while actively implementing the " new partnership for africa 's development , " working hard to develop the economy and trying to get themselves out of the unfavorable situation in the economic globalization , have also been making every effort to resolve armed conflicts , the major obstacle in the rejuvenation of africa , so as to create a united , peaceful and stable environment .
at present , the overall situation in africa tends to be easing off . the hot issues are obviously cooling off and all countries feel it more urgent to end the armed conflicts .
with the strong support from the united nations and the international community , influential regional organizations , regional big powers and prominent politicians in africa are all taking active actions , stepping up their efforts to resolve regional conflicts and eliminate civil strife . some conflicts and turmoil that lasted for years are now basically under control .
for example , a government of national unity was established in con@@ go - kin@@ sh@@ as@@ a in june last year ; s@@ ao t@@ ome and princi@@ pe peacefully resolved a coup crisis in july ; the liber@@ ian government and the rebel armed groups signed a peace accord in august in acc@@ ra , capital of gh@@ ana ; the sud@@ anese government and the southern rebel armed groups started the crucial talks in september that broke the stalemate in peace process ; various som@@ ali armed forces and political factions started a peace talk in ken@@ ya in october to discuss the peace process in the entire country ; and the bur@@ undi government and rebel armed groups signed a peace agreement in november and so on .
of course , the current stability in africa is still relatively ten@@ uous and the peace achievements still need to be consolidated . and some potential or existing armed conflicts are still to be finally resolved .
in the meantime , the economic growth rate in african countries is still far behind those in the developing countries in asia and other regions . these are all unfavorable factors in the development of africa .
how african countries can effectively cope with the challenge of economic globalization and realize the dream of african rejuvenation still needs the long - term and arduous efforts on the part of the african peoples .
recently , some parts of our country were hit one after another by the epidemic of the highly pathog@@ enic avian influenza (h@@ pai@@ ) .
the central party committee and the state council take the situation very seriously and have promptly made a series of major decisions , clearly setting forth the guidelines , policies and measures for prevention and control .
all relevant local agencies and departments are mobilized for the emergency , and are sparing no efforts in preventing the spread of the epidemic in accordance with the plans of the party central committee and the state council .
at present , the work on prevention and control of the bird flu in the entire country is being carried out in an intense but orderly manner .
h@@ pai is a type of animal epidemic that spreads fast and causes great damages . it wrea@@ ks havoc to animal husbandry and seriously threatens the health and safety of the general human population .
since the effective prevention and control of h@@ pai is linked with the health and safety of the people , the development of agriculture and additional income of peasants , the overall economic development and the social stability , all local agencies and departments must follow the important thought of " three represents " as their guideline ; and in accordance with the requirements set forth by the law on animal epidemic prevention of the people 's republic of china , they must strengthen leadership and act in closer coordination , rely on science , carry out prevention and control according to the law , mobilize the vast majority of masses for prevention and control , and handle cases in a resolute manner . taking serious responsibility for the people and effectively implementing various prevention and control measures , they are determined to win this blocking action against the bird flu .
as the largest debtor country in the world , the united states has seen the increase of its foreign debt again .
the u@@ .@@ s . department of the treasury announced on january 16 that as of the end of september last year , the debt the united states owed various types of foreign creditors hit a total of 6.@@ 4@@ 94 trillion u@@ .@@ s . dollars , up 2.2 % over the figure last released .
on the average , each american owes more than 20,000 u@@ .@@ s . dollars in foreign debt .
co@@ incidentally , the im@@ f had issued a study a week earlier , sending a systematic and sharp warning about the prec@@ arious u@@ .@@ s . financial foundation . it pointed out that the u@@ .@@ s . foreign debt , which keeps breaking records , has reached a level that poses a threat to the global financial stability .
statistics show that private foreign investors control about 40 % of the u@@ .@@ s . government bonds .
this inevitably reminds us of key@@ n@@ es ' proposal to president ro@@ os@@ evel@@ t in the first half of the 20th century : adopting a deficit policy to stimulate economy at home while making up for the financial loss by means of foreign debt .
this measure indeed played an important role in stimulating the " effective demand " to solve the impending economic crisis .
however , people have noticed that many u@@ .@@ s . administrations tended to use it as a " miraculous cure . "
but since the 1980s when president re@@ agan advocated tax cuts and military expansion , the u@@ .@@ s . deficit has been climbing up and the united states eventually has become the largest debtor nation .
the opening of the first round of six - nation talks was a major step toward the dialogue and peace process on the korean peninsula nuclear issue .
some con@@ sensu@@ ses reached by all parties during the talks have laid the necessary ground@@ work for the continuation of the talks and further outlined the goals , approaches and guidelines for the solution to the korean peninsula nuclear issue .
in the past few months , all parties concerned maintain that the nuclear issue on the peninsula should be peacefully solved through dialogue . based on the results of the first round of six - nation talks , they conducted extensive coordination and consultation at different levels and made un@@ tiring efforts so as to bring about the second round of talks as early as possible .
in the meantime , north korea and the united states also further demonstrated some degree of flexibility .
now that major progresses have been made in preparations for the talks , we all hope that we should make the talks a success .
what the second round of six - nation talks can accomplish and whether the peace process can be continued are the general concerns of all parties involved and the international community .
in response , the spokesman for the chinese foreign ministry said that the goal of the six - nation talks is to maintain and promote dialogue and peace process . we are willing to work jointly with all parties to achieve that goal .
the basic starting point for the chinese side is to maintain peace and stability in a nuclear - free korean peninsula .
the chinese side believes that as long as all parties participating in the talks uphold their sincerity in peace talks , mutual respect , and equality in consultations , they will be able to create conditions helpful for the solution to the issues concerned .
the relations between the united states and lib@@ ya deteriorated in the late 1970s , and the two countries severed their diplomatic ties in 1981 .
u@@ .@@ s . president re@@ agan once made a lengthy list of crimes for lib@@ ya 's leader q@@ add@@ af@@ i , accusing lib@@ ya of secretly developing nuclear weapons and engaging in external military intervention and terrorism .
as the verbal attacks between the two sides escalated to military actions , the united states launched two surgical air strikes against lib@@ ya called " pr@@ airi@@ e fire " and " el dor@@ ado can@@ y@@ on . "
since then , the united states had put lib@@ ya under economic sanctions , political attacks , diplomatic constraints and military threats .
however , q@@ add@@ af@@ i did not give in under pressures .
now seeing a th@@ aw in the relations between the united states and lib@@ ya , some people attributed it entirely to the deterrent effect of the iraq war . this seems to be rather biased .
in fact , q@@ add@@ af@@ i , a man of extraordinary character , has been waving the ol@@ ive branch to the united states over the years all along while he is engaged in the fight against the country . it is only a pity that he hasn 't got any response .
after the war in iraq was over , all parties in the middle east readjusted their strategies and regional forces were reorganized . this has provided a turning point for the restoration of diplomatic ties between the united states and lib@@ ya .
to q@@ add@@ af@@ i , the restoration of friendly ties with the united states can end sanctions , rejuven@@ ate economy , improve people 's life , and get his country out of isolation into integration with the international community .
by giving up what it hasn 't got and may not be able to get for some time , lib@@ ya can find a silver lining in an entirely new situation in return .
from february 7 to february 8 , top politicians in europe , the united states and the rest of the world gathered in mun@@ ich , germany , to attend the 40th mun@@ ich conference on security policy .
the so - called " mun@@ ich conference on security policy " is an international forum on security founded by a non - government individual and funded by the german government . in recent years , it has gained increasing attention especially after the sep@@ t.@@ 11 attacks and has been honored as the " d@@ avo@@ s forum " on security .
one of the major topics for the conference this time is trans@@ at@@ lan@@ tic relations .
the remarks by the top european and u@@ .@@ s . politicians either at the conference or outside the conference showed that both sides are trying their best to get rid of the dark shadow that the iraq war has brought over their relations and are making every effort to resume their cooperation .
ber@@ tram , director of the german institute for international politics and security in ber@@ lin , said that this was a meeting for the united states and europe to repair their relations as both sides had the desire to get closer again .
the new message from the conference regarding the european and u@@ .@@ s . relations is that europe and the united states need to re@@ start the dialogue . they should seriously consider the common tasks both face and find the convergence of interests needed for the accomplishment of these common tasks .
compared with the conference last year , there was no sign of bel@@ lig@@ erence at this year 's conference . both parties are moving closer in their positions .
although " old europe " represented by france and germany was still res@@ ent@@ ful about the u@@ .@@ s . war on iraq , it agreed to " look forward . "
f@@ ischer , the german foreign minister , said at the conference : although we hold different views about the war , we must jointly ensure peace in post - war iraq . for that reason we must look forward .
he added that germany will not hinder the nato from playing a direct role in iraq though it will not send troops to iraq .
the united states has the most advanced modern media and monopol@@ izes a substantial part of international press . the extent of its propaganda has long reached every corner of the world and has virtually become ubiquitous . why does it want to spend huge investment now in setting up a satellite television network that covers specifically the 22 countries across the middle east ?
quoting the head of " al@@ hur@@ ra " tv station , it is to provide arab countries a news platform of " comprehensive and fair viewpoints . "
however , some analysts pointed out that " al@@ hur@@ ra " will be the strategic weapon used by the united states to carry out media infiltration , cultural invasion and psychological warfare in arab countries . it is an important propaganda tool for the united states to implement its policy of restructuring the middle east and reforming the isl@@ amic world .
in that sense , " al@@ hur@@ ra " has an extraordinary mission which chiefly consists of three major points . the first is to spread " the concept of freedom . "
the united states considers the isl@@ amic civilization a serious hurdle to the promotion of the modern western civilization . the religious extremist forces in the isl@@ amic countries in the middle east are the breeding ground for the international terrorism that has a distinctive feature of anti - americ@@ anism . in order to effectively combat terrorism , the isl@@ amic world must be reformed so that it will identify with and accept the western values , style of life and political system .
through the subtle influence of " al@@ hur@@ ra " programs , the united states attempts to instill its own ideology in ar@@ abs .
the second is to improve the u@@ .@@ s . image .
externally , the united states adopts unilater@@ alism and acts like a bul@@ ly in whatever way it wants on many international issues . such hegemony has in@@ fur@@ i@@ ated the arab countries and isl@@ amic world .
after the sep@@ t.@@ 11 attacks , the conflict escalated between the united states that has persistently favored israel and the isl@@ amic world in the middle east .
without any verified evidence and the un authorization , the united states invaded iraq by force under the pretext of eliminating weapons of mass destruction and counter - terrorism , arousing strong re@@ vul@@ sion from the muslim community .
as the talks between pak@@ istani and indian officials were held in isl@@ am@@ abad from february 16 to february 18 , the hope of peace is re@@ kin@@ dled across the south asia sub@@ continent .
the officials from the two countries set the schedule and mode of talks for the future and established the mechanism for continuous dialogue . this move marks the resumption of the pak@@ istani - indian dialogue two years after it broke off , and lays the foundation for the two countries to gradually solve all those pending issues including the kash@@ mir dispute . it is a demonstration of the precious sincerity for peace on both sides .
prior to this meeting , most analysts were still cautious about the prospects of peace process though the relations between the two countries are th@@ aw@@ ing at a series of goodwill gestures from both sides , .
that is understandable . the memory of turbulent ups and downs in the pak@@ istani - indian relations in recent years seems too fresh for anyone to guarantee that the sunshine upon the negotiation table today would not change into a thunder@@ storm over the borders tomorrow .
however , when pakistan 's foreign affairs secretary ri@@ az k@@ ho@@ k@@ har , with a smile on his face , read the statement by the two countries on the 18th , optimism indeed prev@@ ailed and sent new hopes to many people who have been long concerned with the situation in south asia .
first , the timetable set by this meeting is highly operative . both parties not only confirmed the specific time and topics for the meeting but also decided on the different levels of meeting in accordance with the degree of importance of the topics .
second , both parties learned the lesson from the acc@@ ra summit in july 2001 when the direct dialogue between the leaders of the two countries ended in failure and adopted " a step - by - step " dialogue approach , starting the dialogue from the low level upward so that full preparations will be made for the dialogue of higher level .
furthermore , after experiencing a series of ebb and flow of the bilateral relations , both countries agree that war is not a good solution to disputes and that both should stay away from war . this consensus has laid the foundation for the leaders of both countries to reach a common understanding in future that " there will never be another war between india and pakistan . "
in order to completely and accurately understand and implement the principle of " one country , two systems , " we must integrate " one country " with " two systems " and " love of the nation " with " love of hong kong . " we must both respect hong kong 's high degree of autonomy and safeguard our country 's sovereignty . and we must retain the capitalism in hong kong while adhering to socialism in the main body of our country .
only by doing this can we effectively safeguard the blessings of hong kong compatriots and meet the long - term interests of our country and entire people .
since the return of hong kong , the central government has firmly implemented the principle of " one country , two systems " and strictly observed the " basic law . "
the vast majority of hong kong compatriots , as their own masters , have enjoyed unprecedented democratic rights .
with the strong support by the central government and the mainland , hong kong has overcome various risks and challenges such as the asian financial crisis and continued to maintain its position as an international financial , trade and shipping center .
our practice has proved that " the principle of " one country , two systems " has strong vitality .
today the re@@ publication of comrade deng xia@@ oping 's speech two decades ago demonstrated to the world again the firm determination of the central government in implementing the principle of " one country , two systems . " moreover , it serves to give everyone a comprehensive and accurate understanding of the principle of " one country , two systems " so that the great practice of this principle will be continuously pressed ahead .
today , the central party committee and the state council held a grand ceremony here for china 's state science and technology award .
president hu j@@ intao presented the award certificates to the 2003 state top science and technology award winners , academicians liu d@@ ong@@ sheng and wang yong@@ zhi .
the conference presented certificates to china 's manned space project that wins the state scientific and technological progress special award and to the scientists who win the 2003 state natural science award , the state technological invention award and the state scientific and technological progress award .
on behalf of the central party committee and the state council , i hereby give my warm congratul@@ ation to all the winners !
i hereby give my sinc@@ e@@ rest greeting and highest respect to the scientific and technological personnel in all fields in the country !
to our country , the first two decades of this century mean an important strategic period that we must grasp firmly for great accomplishments .
we must concentrate on building an overall well - to - do society of higher level that will benefit billions of people .
to take full advantage of this strategic period and strive for achievements , we must attach greater importance and prominence to the development of science and technology .
after the sep@@ t. 11 attacks , u@@ .@@ s . president bush proposed the " pre@@ emptive strategy " in june 2002 and put it into practice in u@@ .@@ s . foreign affairs . in march last year , the first pre@@ emptive war was fought in iraq .
the concept of " pre@@ emption " is not only inconsistent with the guideline of the international law that is centered on " mutual respect of sovereignty and territorial integrity " but also will surely trigger the dangerous copy@@ cat effect , threatening the international order with new turmo@@ ils .
when the " pre@@ emptive " theory was first proposed , some prominent u@@ .@@ s . politicians asked the question : " what if other countries all follow the example ? "
just as they expected , more and more countries claimed that they also want to go " pre@@ emptive " in the recent two years and their number is growing .
this is a new trend that warrants attention and study .
in the very month when bush proposed " the pre@@ emptive strategy , " australian prime minister h@@ oward was the first one to stand up and show his support .
he said that australia would adopt " pre@@ emptive " tactics and have no scru@@ ples about taking military actions in the neighboring countries once it received any confirmed intelligence that terrorists were to attack australia .
he even proposed that the principle of " pre@@ emption " be written into the un charter as he considered it necessary to amend the un charter so as to give all nations " pre@@ emptive " rights to fight terrorists or countries that support terrorism .
in northeast asia , japan 's defense agency proposed long ago in the white paper on defense released in july 1999 that japan could launch " pre@@ emptive " strikes on foreign bases prior to missile attacks or military invasion .
after the war in iraq , japan became even more unscrupulous in its advocacy of the " pre@@ emptive " strategy .
recently , there have been quite many international comments on the current u@@ .@@ s . africa policy .
in this year 's january issue of " foreign policy in focus , " a u@@ .@@ s . magazine , there is an article entitled " africa policy outlook 2004 . " according to this article , the foreign policy of the bush administration in the past year has directly or indirectly brought negative impact on africa . in particular , the u@@ .@@ s . pre@@ occupation with the war on terror and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , and especially the u@@ .@@ s . presence in iraq have greatly diluted its attention to africa .
people still remember that in order to show its concern for africa , the bush administration set forth a " president 's emergency plan for aids relief " in january last year and promised to provide at least 3 billion u@@ .@@ s . dollars each year to africa .
in july last year , president bush successively visited five african countries of sen@@ eg@@ al , south africa , bot@@ swana , ug@@ anda and n@@ ig@@ eria and pledged 15 billion u@@ .@@ s . dollars in assisting african countries in their prevention and treatment of aids and another 100 million u@@ .@@ s . dollars for fighting terrorist activities in africa . other africa aid programs such as food emergency program and education assistance program were also announced .
these aid programs were once greatly welcomed by african countries and won quite a lot of international acclaim .
however , one year has passed without any sign of concrete fulfil@@ ment by the united states .
africa is in urgent need of assistance .
entering the new century , africa faces a host of challenges in its development all the more . in order to realize the " millennium development goals " set forth by the united nations in 2000 , work hard to reduce hunger and poverty , and promote health and education , africa founded the " african union " to take overall charge of african affairs and established " the new partnership for africa 's development " aimed at promoting development in all countries . however , due to poor financial resources , lack of development funds has always been a problem .
the united nations has repeatedly called for the developed countries to allocate 0.7 % of their gn@@ p to be used as official aid to the most underdeveloped countries .
however , with its official aid only accounting for 0.1 % of its gn@@ p , the united states has far failed the un requirement and ranked at the bottom of the list of donor countries .
recently , the european media has been discussing a hot topic : whether the " big three " summit of german chancellor scho@@ der , french president ch@@ irac and british prime minister bl@@ air is gradually institution@@ alized .
the media calls the " big three " of germany , france and britain the eu 's " new tro@@ i@@ ka " and the relations among the three countries the " new tri@@ angular relations . "
the " new tri@@ angle " is a new phenomenon . it remains to be observed as to where it is going . however , no matter from what perspective , the " new tri@@ angle " overall seems to be conducive to the unification of europe and therefore will help europe to play an important role as one pole of the multi - polar world in the international arena .
a survey of european history of a hundred years shows that the tri@@ angular relations among germany , france and britain have one basic characteristic : the alliance between britain and france in controlling or opposing germany .
two world wars are the proofs .
in the era of cold war , both east germany and west germany were respectively constrained by war@@ sha@@ w convention and north at@@ lan@@ tic treaty organization .
after the cold war ended , the unified germany became even more powerful , causing an imbalance of power in west europe . the growing suspicion of france led to the temporary mal@@ functioning of germany - france axis . as a result , britain and france got close again with the same old intention of controlling germany .
however , with " germany - france axis " back into operation and the fierce conflict between the concepts of the uni@@ polarization and multipolarization of the world , the eu has become seriously divided internally on the issue of iraq in recent years .
the " old europe " represented by germany and france holds exactly the opposite position from that of " new europe " represented by britain and poland on the issue of the iraq war .
furthermore , the split happens to occur exactly at a time when the eu is going to have the largest expansion in its history .
egy@@ ptian president mu@@ barak recently made a speech on the reforms in arab countries in c@@ air@@ o and criticized the outside world for imposing an uniform mode of reform on arab countries . he warned that such attempt could only get the opposite results and would do no good to the security and stability in the middle east .
in his opinion , the reform measures should be based on individual characteristics and depend on resources available , while the uniform mode of reform ignores the cultural backgrounds , social customs and religious features of different countries .
at the same time , he also pointed out that arab countries welcome outside help in the process of their reforms , but these efforts must fully recognize the different national conditions and respect the wishes of different countries so as to promote the reforms in political , economic and cultural areas in arab countries .
the egy@@ ptian leader 's speech represented the common view of arab countries .
under the current pressures of fighting against terrorism , preventing proliferation and conducting democratic reforms , the middle east , as one of the hot spots in the world , is brewing new turmoil that will lead to new reorganization .
after experiencing the two wars in af@@ gh@@ anistan and iraq , how will iraq , once considered one of the " axis of evil " countries by the united states , carry out political reconstruction ?
how will various kinds of political systems and social modes in the middle east evolve ?
this is not only the concern of the arab world and the international community , but more than that , it is also something that the united states and its western allies are interested in .
after his meeting with visiting ba@@ h@@ rain 's crown prince sal@@ man on the 9th in washington , u@@ .@@ s . secretary of state pow@@ ell reiterated that the united states wants to promote the " plan of western democracy and capitalism " in iraq and the middle east .
he also stressed : " we are thinking about what else we can do and how we can institution@@ alize them . "
last year was the year designated by the international oly@@ mpic committee as the year of " culture and education . "
beijing organizing committee of the oly@@ mpic games (b@@ oc@@ og@@ ) took this good opportunity to hold a series of educational activities that promote advanced culture and popularize the oly@@ mpic knowledge .
among them , the publication of the " secondary school oly@@ mpic reader " chiefly for youth read@@ ership is one of the most important achievements .
the book , rich both in illustration and text , provides a systematic and vivid introduction of the oly@@ mpic movement and the essence of the oly@@ mpic spirit mainly through story telling . it serves as good teaching materials that will help enhance young students ' understanding of the oly@@ mpic movement and increase the society 's enthusiasm for participation in the oly@@ mpic games .
last year , b@@ oc@@ og also designed a schedule of classes specially for young students that is printed on recycled paper with the logo of beijing oly@@ mpic games .
the concept of " green oly@@ mp@@ ics " means that oly@@ mpic games should be prepared and held under the guideline of sustainable development such as protecting the environment and ecological balance .
we hope these schedules of classes will regulate students ' behavior just as they set the schedules for classes and will gradually make them practitioners and advoc@@ ators of the concept of " green oly@@ mp@@ ics . "
education is one of the core components of the oly@@ mpic movement . it is also an important embodiment of " civilized oly@@ mp@@ ics . "
the real objective of oly@@ mp@@ ics is to educate young people with a new approach and from a new perspective and promote the harmonious development of both psychological and physical well - beings so that they will make contributions to building a peaceful and beautiful world .
therefore , the combination of sports and education not only opens up a new world for the development of education but also makes the oly@@ mpic movement more educational .
" green oly@@ mp@@ ics " is one of the three concepts that beijing upholds in hosting the 2008 oly@@ mpic games .
it basically means to significantly enhance the environmental quality of the capital , create a beautiful environment for the oly@@ mpic games and build an ec@@ ologically - friendly city .
to achieve these goals , we must extensively adopt environmental protection technologies and measures , proceed with a large - scale environmental treatment in various aspects and with afforestation and beau@@ tification of urban and rural areas , and promote the development of the environmental protection industry . we must constantly raise public awareness of environmental protection and encourage everyone to actively participate in various activities aimed to improve the ecological environment .
to effectively implement " a green oly@@ mp@@ ics " is an important task for us to carry out the 3rd plenary session of the 16th cpc central committee 's proposal of adhering to the people - based principle and establishing the scientific viewpoint of comprehensive , coordinated and sustainable development , and to promote a comprehensive , coordinated and sustainable economic and social development of the city of beijing .
we must lay great emphasis on this .
in order to realize the goal of a green oly@@ mp@@ ics , beijing municipality has formulated an " oly@@ mpic action plan " and " ecosystem and environment protection plan " based on the " tenth five - year plan " and the " bid proposal " and set forth new goals and plans for environmental construction and protection in the next few years .
the goal of hosting a green oly@@ mp@@ ics will be fully realized through planning and step - by - step implementation .
on february 25 , the u@@ .@@ s . department of state released its " 2003 country reports on human rights practices " and is again finding fault with the human rights conditions in more than 190 countries and regions including china . assuming the tone of a " head@@ master , " it labeled many countries as having poor human rights conditions , failing to meet u@@ .@@ s . standards , as bad as could be , while claiming some countries back@@ sli@@ ded in key human rights areas , and so on and so forth .
of course , there are still some countries that have seen great improvements in their human rights conditions , such as af@@ gh@@ anistan and iraq , but these are the " achievements " of the u@@ .@@ s . military in over@@ throwing the former regimes and " liberating " the two countries .
yet how about the human rights conditions in the united states ?
just as in previous years , the report made no comment .
to make up for the lack of report on the u@@ .@@ s . human rights conditions , the information office of china 's state council released " the human rights record of the united states in 2003 " on march 1 .
citing a large quantity of fac@@ tual evidence , the article presents many human rights problems in the united states and the u@@ .@@ s . infringement upon human rights of other countries .
americ@@ ans historically have a tradition of honesty and admitting mistakes made .
the well - known story about young ge@@ orge washington cutting the ch@@ erry tree is a vivid example .
now that it has become the only superpower in the world , the united states , on the contrary , seldom speaks the truth .
recently , some change has quietly taken place in the coverage of china 's economic development by japan 's mainstream media .
contrary to the previous " china threat theory , " many media reports in japan now start to hold the opinion that the economic development of china has promoted the economic recovery of japan and that the demand of the thriving chinese market has become an important drive for japan 's economic development .
an article recently carried in the u@@ .@@ s . news@@ week also said that the rise of china is more an opportunity than a threat to other countries , especially to its neighboring countries .
the once widespread " china threat theory " is now being replaced by a " china opportunity theory . "
the " china threat theory " asserts that the development of china will pose a threat to other countries , especially its neighboring countries .
however , this assertion aimed at sowing dis@@ cord is not accepted by china 's neighboring countries .
former malay@@ sian president ma@@ ha@@ thir once stated directly : " asian countries have no need to fear china 's growing military and economic power because china does not have the tradition of invading foreign countries . "
in a published long - term plan , the indian defense ministry also maintains that china poses no military threat to india .
in economic and trade fields , the governments and corporations of various countries all consider china their best choice for market expansion . overseas investors with strategic visions are firmly val@@ id@@ ating the " china opportunity theory " through their actions : of the fortune 500 in the world , more than 400 have come to invest in china .
over past consecutive years , china has topped the world in foreign investment attraction .
g@@ d@@ p is a globally accepted important macroeconomic indicator .
it is of crucial importance to maintain the growth of g@@ d@@ p throughout the entire process of our country 's modernization .
for the simple reason that an increase of one percentage point from the current g@@ d@@ p of our country can result in more than 800,000 jobs , we all must maintain the momentum of rapid economic growth .
to realize the grand goal of building an overall well - to - do society and the third - phase strategic goal of modernization depends very much on the sustained rapid growth of g@@ d@@ p .
however , we should see that g@@ d@@ p , as an indicator , has its own f@@ law .
for example , it cannot easily reflect the quality and composition of economic growth accurately , cannot easily reflect the actual level of social welfare people enjoy , nor can it measure accurately the social distribution and social fairness , and so on .
on the other hand , g@@ d@@ p is not the only indicator .
our assessment of political performance shall not look at the growth of g@@ d@@ p alone . we shall also look at the actual material and cultural life of the general public . we will look at the employment situation , social security and even social justice , social order , social management , social harmony , etc. in the area .
therefore , we must treat the existing g@@ d@@ p verification system scientifically both in thinking and approaches and find the right place for g@@ d@@ p in the entire economic and social development .
we must maintain some level of its growth rate , but at the same time we should not ov@@ erv@@ al@@ ue it . and we should certainly not exclusively and purposely seek after it .
since the security council delegation visited the six west african countries at the end of june last year , the overall situation in the entire region has seen encouraging changes , though the situation in a few countries turned back to turmoil for a time .
we are pleased to see that the government of si@@ erra le@@ one is making positive progress in enhancing the capabilities of its army and police and in stepping up control of the country 's diam@@ onds and preparing for the election of local governments . the un special delegation to si@@ erra le@@ one is also gradually sc@@ aling down according to the original schedule .
equally encouraging is that with the deployment of the un special delegation to liber@@ ia , liber@@ ia is gradually walking out of the turmoil brought by protracted wars and starting to embark on the road to recovery and reconstruction .
the political process in gu@@ ine@@ a - bis@@ sa@@ u has also made positive progress . the transitional government has promised to hold the legislative election in march this year .
the peace process in co@@ te d � i@@ vi@@ ore took a turn for the better again after suffering a few setbacks . all parties have promised to implement the lin@@ as - mar@@ cous@@ sis accord . " the new forces " announced its return to the government of national reconciliation and the security council is studying its plan to dispatch peacekeeping missions .
we expect that the security council will make the decision as soon as possible .
the secretariat , ec@@ ow@@ as and other relevant parties also worked hard to solve cross - border issues such as sal@@ w trafficking , merc@@ enary activities and recruitment of child soldiers from the perspective of the region and have achieved positive results .
while fully affirming the aforementioned progresses , we should realize that the overall situation in west africa is in a way still prec@@ arious . due to ge@@ o - political and historical reasons in particular , the countries in the region are closely linked and mutually influential . the turmoil in one country often affects the neighboring countries and even the entire region .
therefore , just as proposed in the security council report , the international community , including the security council , must stick to a comprehensive and overall strategy in solving the issues in west africa , and spare no efforts to tackle the cross - border issues . in the meantime , it must actively assist the countries concerned , the regional or sub - regional organizations such as the au and ec@@ ow@@ as and strengthen their capabilities to prevent and solve conflicts .
we share a common understanding that children are the future of the world .
we have the obligation to create the best and most suitable conditions to benefit their life , study , growth , maturity and success .
however , it is regrettable that thousands of children in the world today are still victimized by armed conflicts .
what they have experienced is turmoil and backwardness ; what they have seen is violence and destruction ; what they suffer is injuries and abuses ; and what they feel is sadness and helplessness .
therefore , it is an important obligation of the international community to protect children from being harmed by armed conflicts .
all countries , especially those involved in the conflicts , should make their utmost efforts toward this goal .
we are pleased to see that in recent years the united nations has taken a series of measures in promoting the protection of children caught in armed conflicts and has achieved positive results .
the security council passed in succession the four resolutions of no@@ .@@ 12@@ 61 ( 1999 ) , no@@ .@@ 13@@ 14 ( 2000 ) , no@@ .@@ 13@@ 79 ( 2001 ) and no@@ .@@ 14@@ 60 ( 2003 ) , which provide the important framework for protection of children .
the peacekeeping missions deployed by the united nations in some regions regard the protection of children as an important task , which includes appointing child protection advisors and taking full consideration of children 's special needs when they assist the host countries in carrying out programs of disarmament , demobil@@ ization and social re@@ integration .
some peace accords promoted by the united nations or reached through the un involvement also include a clause on child protection .
national reconciliation is an important condition for establishing long - lasting peace and stability in post - conflict regions .
after the conflict is ended , if the parties involved cannot bury the hat@@ ch@@ et , it will be hard to truly consolidate the peace and the fire of conflict may even be re@@ kin@@ dled .
under many circumstances , to bring about post - conflict national reconciliation needs the joint efforts of all parties involved . at the same time it also needs the support and assistance of the international community , especially the united nations .
for many years , the united nations has played a useful role in helping and promoting post - conflict national reconciliation process and has accumulated a great deal of experience . generally speaking , we believe , in order to successfully assist the post - conflict countries to achieve national reconciliation , the united nations must properly handle the following three major relationships .
it must give consideration to the relationship between immediate needs and long - term goals .
national reconciliation usually takes a certain period of process and may not be accomplished in a single move .
different phases require different focuses .
the first effort at national reconciliation is to get the former bel@@ lig@@ eren@@ ts to bid " farewell to arms " and create a safe environment .
during this phase , it is very important that efforts should be made to dis@@ arm and demobil@@ ize the former bel@@ lig@@ eren@@ ts and re@@ integrate them into the community .
we are pleased to see that the situation in bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina is getting stabilized ; ethnic relations are further eased ; initial success has been achieved in economic reconstruction ; the return of refugees has basically completed ; and its relations with neighboring countries is improving .
we are very much gratified about these hard won achievements in the peace process in bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina .
we hereby express our congratul@@ ation on the government of bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina and its people and sincerely hope that all parties in bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina will continue their efforts to further strengthen mutual trust and cooperation and move forward with the peace process .
at the same time , we 've also noticed that the government agencies and their capabilities in bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina still need further improvement . the reforms , especially in the judiciary and police , are still faced with challenges .
we think it is appropriate for high representatives to focus their work on this area for the first half of this year and we support the government of bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina in its active cooperation with high representatives .
we believe that with the help of the international community , the people of bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina will continue to make new achievements in meeting the challenge of building their own country and embark on the road to autonomous development as soon as possible , which will lead to its successful integration with europe .
the peace and stability in bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina are of great significance to the realization of lasting peace and development in the region .
the chinese side has been watching closely the development of the situation in bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina . together with the international community , it will continue to make its contribution in assisting bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina to achieve long - term security and economic development .
china appreciates the efforts of the counter - terrorism committee to promote the implementation of the resolution 13@@ 73 ( 2001 ) in all states and to help enhance the anti - terrorist capabilities of developing countries . it supports the c@@ t@@ c for strengthening its coordination and cooperation with the relevant international , regional and sub - regional organizations in the global war on terror .
at the same time , we hope that the c@@ t@@ c will step up anti - terrorist assistance and work hard to meet the actual needs of developing countries .
at present , the issue of rejuvenating the c@@ t@@ c has drawn the concern of most member states .
after many consultations , the c@@ t@@ c put forward an official report and distributed it as a security council document .
after more than two years of operation , the existing composition and mode of operation of the c@@ t@@ c indeed showed some deficiencies . for instance , member states were over@@ loaded with reports , meetings and excessive paper@@ work ; working efficiency needs improvement ; and there is not sufficient coordination among the experts .
therefore , we fully support the necessary reform of the c@@ t@@ c . we agree with the package plan proposed by the report about the establishment of a c@@ t@@ c executive directorate and others . and we also hope that all these existing problems can be properly solved as soon as possible , especially the problem of member states being over@@ loaded with reports .
what i want to stress here is that rejuvenation and reform are an ongoing process . no matter what kind of reform is done , the c@@ t@@ c should always maintain its guidance and direction over the work of the executive directorate with regard to policies . any policy making decision should all be made through consensus reached by consultations with the plenary of the c@@ t@@ c .
in recent years , the issue of sal@@ w has drawn the close attention of the international community .
this shows that all parties have increasingly realized the damage the proliferation and illicit trafficking of sal@@ w have caused to the stability , post - war reconstruction and social development in the regions and countries concerned .
fortunately , the united nations has taken a series of effective actions to solve this issue .
in 2001 , the " firearms protocol " to the " un convention against transnational organized crime " and the un sal@@ w " program of action " were reached in succession .
they provide the legal and policy basis for proper settlement of the sal@@ w issue and demonstrate the determination of the international community in cracking down the illicit trade of sal@@ w .
in the past three years , great progress has been made in bringing " firearms protocol " into effect and implementing the " program of action . " the success of the united nations ' first bi@@ ennial meeting on sal@@ w held in 2003 , in particular , has provided a new impetus to continuing the comprehensive and effective implementation of the " program of action . "
the resolution 5@@ 8/@@ 2@@ 41 passed by this general assembly has decided that a working group be established to negotiate on an international document to identify and trace illicit sal@@ w . this doub@@ tlessly will further stimulate international efforts to combat the illicit trade of sal@@ w .
likewise , the security council has also placed increasing emphasis on the sal@@ w issue and has conducted several special reviews and passed relevant chairman 's statements and resolutions .
apart from that , the security council consistently emphasizes the importance of settling the sal@@ w issue during its deliberation on a number of issues concerning protection of civilians , women and children in armed conflicts .
economic development and poverty eradication are the basic pre@@ requisites for ensuring sustainable development .
the sustainable development of economy is the material basis for environmental protection and all - round social progress .
without solution to the issue of subsistence , there will be no development to speak of , let alone sustainable development .
to promote economic development and strive to eliminate poverty are the necessary steps that developing countries must take to achieve sustainable development .
without solution to the issue of poverty in developing countries , the developed countries will find it hard to sustain their own development .
to use the resources rationally and to protect the environment are the necessary requirements for achieving sustainable development .
it is impossible for the development to sustain itself if it is achieved at the expense of squ@@ an@@ dering resources and ru@@ ining the environment .
natural resources are not inexhaustible , yet the demand of human development continues to grow . if the relationship between the two is not properly handled , it will inevitably result in the deterioration of the ecosystem , which will seriously threaten the survival and development of mankind .
only by adopting a recycling economy that is based on the most efficient use of resources and the protection of the environment can we achieve sustainable development .
to achieve all - round social progress and enhance the quality of people 's life are the ultimate goals of sustainable development .
my memory of the 9th informal ap@@ ec summit held a year ago by the huang@@ pu river in shanghai still remains vivid .
today , we gather at the pic@@ tu@@ res@@ que los c@@ abo@@ s at this side of the pacific to discuss important plans of economic cooperation in the asia pacific region .
we are over@@ joy@@ ed to meet with our old friends .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to express my heart - felt thanks to president fo@@ x for his gr@@ acious invitation and to the m@@ exic@@ an government for its meticulous arrangements .
in the past year , the continuous development of economic globalization and the rapid progress in science and technology have brought new opportunities for development for all countries .
in the meantime , the increased uncertainties in the world economic development have also posed new challenges to some countries and regions including the ap@@ ec members in their economic development .
with trade protectionism on the rise again , there is still a long way to go to achieve free , fair and equitable trade .
the fight against terror is arduous and complicated as non - traditional security threats have increased .
the world we live in is still not a peaceful one .
although the international community faces a host of problems and other more may pop up unexpectedly in future , the ongoing trend of peace and development is not to be reversed , and the aspiration of the people of all countries for a better life remains unchanged .
it is very significant that development is the them@@ atic topic for this dialogue meeting .
development is the basis for the progress of human civilization and the key to solving various conflicts and problems the world faces .
only by ensuring a coordinated , balanced and universal development of the world can we achieve long - lasting global peace and stability .
we should conduct a comprehensive and in - depth discussion of this issue and make concerted efforts to find its solution .
the accelerating economic globalization has become the most prominent feature of the current world economy .
pushed by the trend of economic globalization , the relations among countries and regions have become increasingly close and the markets are getting more open . there has been an expanded and accelerated flow of capital , technology and personnel . all these have brought unprecedented opportunities for strengthening international cooperation and promoting common development .
at the same time , the trend of economic globalization has also posed harsh challenges and broadened the gap between south and north . some developing countries are faced with the danger of further margin@@ alization . the increased economic and financial risks and the aggravating transnational crimes have also added to the urgency for international cooperation in jointly meeting the challenges .
at this juncture where opportunities and challenges coexist , we should seize the opportunities and meet the challenges . we should seek common grounds while reserving differences . and we should expand cooperation and push the economic globalization in the direction of common development and prosperity .
( international ) flu outbreak peaks in u@@ .@@ s .
xinhua news agency , los angel@@ es , december 31 ( reporter yan liang ) the u@@ .@@ s . centers for disease control and prevention said on the 31st that the worst flu in the united states in more than 30 years has pea@@ ked . widespread influenza activities have been reported in 45 of the 50 u@@ .@@ s . states and the number of flu deaths has rapidly risen .
according to the c@@ d@@ c statistics as of december 20 , the number of flu deaths in the united states has hit a record high , accounting for 7.8 % of all deaths during the same period .
in the united states , at least 42 children have died of the flu , and the number of adult flu deaths is also rapidly rising though accurate statistics are not available at this moment .
according to experts , there are two reasons why the flu became epidemic in 2003 : first , since the flu virus is not the type of " pan@@ ama a " common in the past years , the vaccines manufactured earlier cannot offer effective protection against the virus ; and second , a surplus of flu vaccines last year in the united states has led two major vaccine suppliers to reduce this year 's production to 83 million d@@ oses , causing a vaccine shortage this year .
although on average , 3@@ 6,000 people die of the flu and 114@@ ,000 people are hospitalized with flu each year in the united states , it is rare for the flu to cause such public alarm as this year 's .
according to wil@@ li@@ am th@@ om@@ pson , a u@@ .@@ s . epidem@@ i@@ ologist , this flu is the worst in the united states in more than 30 years and it has also come earlier than usual . quite a number of schools have reported widespread flu activities and long lines have formed at many flu vaccination stations .
in response to such serious situation , the u@@ .@@ s . department of health activated its emergency operations center on december 19 and dispatched teams of medical experts to all states .
traffic accident in z@@ hejiang kills 3 as two vehicles colli@@ de
xinhua news agency , hang@@ zhou , january 1 ( fang lie and zhang h@@ ong@@ ming ) in the early morning of january 1 , a serious traffic accident took place in n@@ ing@@ hai county , z@@ hejiang province .
due to a thick all - envel@@ oping fog , an over@@ loaded car collided with a large truck , leaving 3 dead and 4 injured of the seven people inside the car .
at about 2 a.m. on january 1 , m@@ r. hua was driving a h@@ ong@@ qi taxi with a license plate number of z@@ he@@ b@@ t@@ 8@@ 70@@ 5 on his way to n@@ ing@@ hai from lin@@ hai . 6 passengers were riding in the car .

( archeological discovery ) 31 qin tombs found in feng@@ xiang county , sha@@ anxi province
xinhua news agency , xi 'an , january 15 ( tie ma ) in the past , historians always believed that the palace area in the village of sun@@ ji@@ an@@ an@@ tou in feng@@ xiang county , b@@ ao@@ ji city of sha@@ anxi province became a site for major royal sacrificial offerings only after the qin people relocated their capital to yong city , but the recent accidental discovery of 31 qin tombs in this palace area by sha@@ anxi provincial institute of arche@@ ology may be expected to change this belief .
to meet the need of a company in b@@ ao@@ ji city that plans to acquire the ruins for building its factory , sha@@ anxi provincial institute of arche@@ ology conducted an archeological investigation of the site , and in the urgently needed area of about 20,000 square meters , discovered 31 qin tombs dating from the western zhou dynasty to the spring and autumn period .
after the excavation team of yong city , sha@@ anxi province , cleaned up and excavated these ancient tombs , over 40 articles of bronze ware , pottery and other artifacts were uncovered .
one of the qin tombs contains two coff@@ ins and has a pit of two sacrificial horses near the tomb .
in this tomb were uncovered 15 articles of bronze ware and pottery . the bronze ware includes ancient fre@@ est@@ anding cooking vessels , pots , ax@@ es , among others .
among them , the bronze cooking vessel was super@@ bly fashioned with exquisite decorative lines in a well preserved style of cast bronze from the western zhou dynasty .
judging from the sacrificial objects , the owner of this tomb was a qin arist@@ ocr@@ at in late western zhou dynasty .
assuming that , experts believe there should be a large cluster of ancient tombs nearby .
this unexpected discovery is of great historic value to the research on the relocation of the qin capital and the structural layout of yong city during qin and han dynasties .
tian ya@@ qi , associate researcher at sha@@ anxi provincial institute of arche@@ ology and head of the excavation team of yong city , introduced that in the past , historians always believed that the palace area in the village of sun@@ ji@@ an@@ an@@ tou became a site for major royal sacrificial offerings from qin dynasty to western han dynasty only after the qin people relocated their capital to yong city .
however , this discovery shows that long before the capital was relocated to yong city , this area was already a man@@ or estate granted by the western zhou dynasty and had its days of flourishing growth more than once .

xinhua news agency , geneva , january 21 on the 21st , mus@@ sa , secretary general of the league of arab states , urged the united states to discuss democracy with arab nations instead of trying to impose democracy on the middle east .
in an interview with reporters at the annual meeting of world economic forum held in d@@ avo@@ s , switzerland , mus@@ sa said : " if they ( americ@@ ans ) want to establish democracy in the middle east , they 'd better keep their promise and establish democracy first in iraq . "
he said the arab league is the best partner to discuss with the united states about carrying out democratic reforms in the middle east .
" as long as you put forward your point of view and are willing to listen to ours , we can talk about any idea .
we don 't oppose democracy , but democracy is not an operation or order that has to be implemented immediately . "
mus@@ sa said that the u@@ .@@ s . government so far has failed to convince people that its occupation of iraq will bring " democracy " to the country .
" they said they were going to iraq to show us a democratic model to follow .
yet so far we haven 't seen anything . "
tourism in china estimated to have fet@@ ched a total of 48@@ 7.4 billion yuan revenue in 2003
xinhua news agency , beijing , january 22 ( reporter sun yu@@ bo ) china 's tourism , both domestic and international , is estimated to have fet@@ ched a total of 48@@ 7.4 yuan revenue in 2003 . it is a 12.@@ 4 % drop from the previous year , but the performance is better than expected .
statistics from the national tourism administration show that the total number of inbound tourists in 2003 was 91 million , of which 1@@ 1.3 million were foreign tourists and 3@@ 2.7 million were tourists who stayed overnight in china , generating a travel revenue of 17.@@ 3 billion u@@ .@@ s . dollars in foreign exchange .

( international ) economic experts predict u@@ .@@ s . as biggest winner in dollar devaluation
xinhua news agency , d@@ avo@@ s ( switzerland ) january 23 ( reporters li jie and ding x@@ ig@@ ang ) at the 3@@ 4th annual session of world economic forum being held in d@@ avo@@ s , switzerland , a special seminar was held on the trend of dollar devaluation on the 23rd . some experts predict that the united states will be the biggest winner if the exchange rate of u@@ .@@ s . dollar continues to slip .
most participating economists think that u@@ .@@ s . officials including u@@ .@@ s . treasury secretary jo@@ hn snow seem to have already given up the " strong - dollar policy " which has been followed in recent years .
the declining exchange rate of u@@ .@@ s . dollar will provide greater space for economic growth in the united states and more employment opportunities . this is clearly evidenced in the manufacturing industry .
meanwhile , the dollar devaluation will make u@@ .@@ s . products more competitive both at domestic and international markets , helping the united states to make up for its trade deficit .
however , experts think that the weaker dollar can also exert a negative influence on the united states .
first of all , the u@@ .@@ s . stock market will likely continue to decline . with the devaluation of various kinds of investment , foreign investors will withdraw their funds for fear of further dollar devaluation . second , as imported goods become more and more expensive , the american people 's living standards will eventually decline . third , any substantial dollar devaluation can also set off trade and financial turmoil .
however , the dollar devaluation will hit europe , japan and canada even harder .
the drop in the exchange rate of u@@ .@@ s . dollar will put greater pressure on the european exports and push the european economy to the verge of a full - scale recession .
china to speed up development of electronic products in fields such as automotive and medical applications
xinhua news agency , beijing , january 26 ( reporter feng xia@@ of@@ ang ) china will speed up development of various kinds of electronic applications such as automotive electronics , machinery electronics , transportation electronics , and medical electronics to expand the space for growth in the electronic information industry as well as to satisfy various industrial needs .
according to chief officials with the ministry of information industry , one of the major focuses in the promotion and application of information technologies is to reform and upgrade the traditional industries .
to promote the application of information technologies in various industries and increase the market share of domestic products and equipment not only meets the need of reforming and upgrading the traditional industries but also brings about precious opportunities for growth in the electronic information industry .
it is told that while expanding the space for growth in the electronic information industry to meet the needs of various industries , it is also necessary to support the set - up of a public technology service competence system , encouraging companies strong in research and development to provide technical support and warranty to the application of information technology in major industries by means of providing technical standards and testing environments .
at the same time , business practices such as technical services , management consultation and system integration should be developed , and support should be given to help establish a string of service industries like system integration suppliers and application service providers in an effort to promote the development of a new type of information service industry .
( international ) japan 's import and export both rose to new high in 2003
xinhua news agency , tokyo , january 26 ( reporter le sha@@ oy@@ an ) according to the statistics released by japan 's ministry of finance on the 26th , japan 's import and export trade volume both set the highest records in history in 2003 with a trade surplus exceeding again 1 trillion yen in a matter of three years .
in exports , last year japan 's exports to the united states decreased by 9.8 % from the previous year but its exports to asia enjoyed a dramatic increase of 12.@@ 9 % .
this not only made up for japan 's decrease of exports to the united states but also increased japan 's total volume of exports last year by 4.7 % over the previous year to a record of 5@@ 4.@@ 55@@ 89 trillion yen .
in imports , due to the increased demand of energies such as oil and natural gas and their price hikes , japan 's total import volume in 2003 increased 5 % over the previous year to 4@@ 4.@@ 3@@ 202 trillion yen , similarly setting the highest record in history .
japan 's trade surplus in 2003 was 10.@@ 23@@ 87 trillion yen , an increase of 3.6 % over the previous year , exceeding 10 trillion yen for the second time in a matter of three years .
actual number of private - owned enterprises in guangdong exceeds for the first time that of state - owned and controlled enterprises
xinhua news agency , guangzhou , january 26 ( chen ji and hu y@@ ann@@ i ) sources from the bureau of industry and commerce of guangdong province said that in 2003 the actual number of private - owned enterprises in guangdong exceeded for the first time that of state - owned and controlled enterprises , adjusting effectively the domestic funded enterprises .
according to statistics , as of the end of 2003 , there are 69@@ 0,000 enterprises of various kinds ( including domestic - funded , private - owned and foreign - invested enterprises ) in total in the province , an increase of 0.@@ 59 % over the previous year .
among them , there are 3@@ 16,000 domestic - funded enterprises , a drop of 16.@@ 4 % from the end of previous year . the registered capital increased by 0.9 % to 1@@ 19@@ 0.@@ 27 billion yuan . there are 3@@ 23@@ ,000 private - owned enterprises with 45@@ 2.@@ 28 billion yuan in registered capital , with increases of 2@@ 4.9 % and 3@@ 3.8 % respectively . there are 5@@ 2,000 foreign - invested enterprises with 14@@ 0.5 billion u@@ .@@ s . dollars in registered capital , with increases of 3.6 % and 4.1 % respectively .
for the first time , the actual number of private - owned enterprises exceeded that of state - owned and controlled enterprises .
although the number of state - owned and controlled enterprises decreased in their structural adjustment , their actual cl@@ out steadily increased with average registered capital ( fund ) per company reaching 3.@@ 76 million yuan , an increase of 20 % as compared with that at the end of 2002 .

the ratios of domestic - funded , private - owned and foreign - invested enterprises over the total number of newly registered enterprises are respectively 16 : 78 : 6 .
( international ) w@@ to submits " by@@ rd subsidy " dispute for arbitration
xinhua news agency , geneva , january 26 ( reporter li jie ) w@@ to announced on the 26th that the petitions of the eu and other seven w@@ to members to impose sanctions on the united states for its implementation of " by@@ rd subsidy " have been submitted to the arbitration agency .
the petitions for sanctions originated from the united states ' failure to repeal " the by@@ rd amendment " within the deadline set by w@@ to .
" the by@@ rd amendment " passed by the u@@ .@@ s . congress in 2000 requires the u@@ .@@ s . government to subsidize the victimized u@@ .@@ s . companies directly with the punitive tariffs collected in the anti - dumping and anti - subsidy cases instead of sending them to the u@@ .@@ s . department of the treasury .
the u@@ .@@ s . move was opposed by its major trade partners including the eu and japan .
w@@ to finally ruled in january 2003 that the amendment violated the rules of the world trade and required the united states to repeal it by december 27 of the same year .
but the united states did not implement the w@@ to ruling .
as a result , the eu , japan , canada , brazil , india , south korea , m@@ exic@@ o and ch@@ ile recently submitted petitions to the w@@ to , requesting the permission to impose additional duties on some products originating in the united states in amounts equivalent to those of the u@@ .@@ s . government subsidies .
however , the united states immediately challenged the extent of the sanctions and the validity of the petitions .
( hong kong , ma@@ uc@@ ao , taiwan ) retail sales in hong kong up 10 % during spring festival
xinhua news agency , hong kong , january 28 hong kong retail management association disclosed that retail sales in hong kong are doing pretty well during the lunar new year . the industry has seen an average of 10 % increase of business revenue while some shopping centers have even enjoyed 20 % to 30 % increases .
yu p@@ eng@@ chun , chairman of the hong kong retail management association , indicated the other day that mainland tourists taking personal trips to hong kong have helped in creating a shopping atmosphere in hong kong . the retail sales during the spring festival are doing very well in hong kong . some sectors of the industry such as those of jewelry and apparel even enjoyed 20 % to 30 % increases of sales , with the spending of mainland tourists making up about 10 % of the total business revenue .
he said mainland tourists , using r@@ m@@ b credit cards in hong kong , have obviously stimulated the market in the spring festival . each charge averaged 3,000 yuan . some mainland tourists even spent as much as over 10,000 yuan .
last year , the total retail revenue in hong kong dropped 4 % due to s@@ ars .
yu p@@ eng@@ chun predicts that with the economic recovery , the total retail sales in hong kong will have a single - digit increase , but the price of merchandise will be under pressure for upward adjustment due to the cost increase .
he said he believes the deflation in hong kong will be eased this year .
( international ) den@@ mark releases new act that limits immigration
xinhua news agency , stock@@ holm , january 28 , from cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen : the d@@ anish government submitted to the congress a new act that will limit immigration on the 28th .
under the act , children born in den@@ mark to foreign immigrants will no longer have the privilege of obtaining the d@@ anish nationality automatically .
the act is the latest of a series of measures to limit immigration since the d@@ anish freedom party leader r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen took office as prime minister in november 2001 .
it is reported that the act is likely to be passed at the parliament because freedom party has gained the support of the right - wing d@@ anish people 's party over the immigration issue .
the act requires that instead of obtaining the nationality automatically , foreign children born in den@@ mark apply for citizenship when they become adults just as other immigrants do .
natur@@ alized immigrants will be deprived of their citizenship if they have committed criminal activities that are seriously detrimental to the society .
in the past two years , the d@@ anish government has released a series of measures to limit immigration , including setting limits on issuing long - term residence cards and on immigrants ' sponsorship of their relatives to come to den@@ mark .
due to the d@@ anish government 's un@@ friendly attitude toward immigrants , the number of foreign refugees in den@@ mark dropped from 14,@@ 3@@ 47 in 1993 to 3,500 in 2003 .
as a result , the traditional image of den@@ mark as a country boasting freedom and human rights has also been tarn@@ ished .
the achievements made by singapore should not be taken as granted .
no matter how advanced science and technology are , i don 't believe people can maintain an ideal environment with higher quality and standards of living , full employment and increasing salary without making any efforts , keeping social disciplines or adjusting to changes .
these beautiful things do not come by themselves .
only when the people in the entire country realize that they must give priority to group interests and make difficult compromises as well as necessary adjustments can everyone enjoy a beautiful future .
what will singapore be like in 10 to 20 years from now ?
we all wish we could predict the future but the future is hardly predictable .
many factors are beyond singapore 's control .
the development of many things depends on the development of the world situation .
we don 't know when problems will pop up . more often than not , it depends on luck .
for example , three singap@@ ore@@ ans traveled to hong kong and ended up being infected with s@@ ars . that was unpredictable .
in less than a month after the spring festival , three extraordinary serious accidents occurred in china , each killing dozens of people .
it is regrettable that there should be such a high frequency of accidents and heavy loss of human lives .
a few months prior to this , a natural gas bl@@ ow@@ out at a drilling well in ch@@ ong@@ qing , gas explosions at several coal mines and frequent serious road accidents had resulted in hundreds of deaths .
due to a vast area and dense population , china has a higher probability of disasters than any other countries and the resulting death toll can easily reach tens or even hundreds . objectively , this is a helpless reality .
however , judging from common sense , fatal accidents in china are still far too frequent .
among so many disasters , fire , explosions in coal mines , bl@@ asts in fireworks factories , and traffic accidents are the most common .
this at least shows two problems . first , the safety measures in these fields are the weak@@ est ; second , people do not learn lessons from the past tragedies so that accidents of the same type keep happening .
in the past when singapore was in a period of rapid economic growth , there were also serious fire accidents . however , the tragedies , still vivid in memory , quickly raised singapore 's awareness of safety precautions in public places .
likewise , china today is also in an extraordinary stage of rapid economic growth and social restructuring .
from time to time , there is news that foreign m@@ aids working in this country accidentally fall from buildings . although the figure is not absur@@ dly high percentage - wise , given the relatively safe working environment at home , the frequent occurrence of accidental falls from buildings by no means matches the virtually harm@@ less nature of the job .
according to the statistics , a total of 99 m@@ aids of various nationalities died in accidental falls from buildings from january 1999 to june 2003 .
behind these figures we see not only the broken families that waited in vain for the return of their daughters or mothers and the mis@@ fortunes that should have been avoided , but also the direction of our work to reduce these regrettable figures to the lowest possible level .
according to a statement recently published by the indonesian embassy , 96 indonesian m@@ aids have died while working in singapore since 1999 . some of them fell to their death from tall buildings during work .
the indonesian government expresses its complaints from time to time about the accidental falls of m@@ aids and also set forth new regulations several times so as to rigorously control the qualification of indonesian m@@ aids in our country and ensure their safety . however , the problem persists . as a result , the bilateral relations between singapore and indonesia are inevitably troubled by this maid problem .
what invariably puzz@@ les us deeply is that compared with the number of casualties of guest workers at the construction sites , the number of accidental falls of m@@ aids is surprisingly higher . this could not but make people think there is more need to further investigate its background and causes .
chen k@@ ong@@ li , a world renowned expert on taiwan in the mainland , recently published his new book entitled " observing taiwan . "
most of articles collected in the book were all written in a period from the first rotation of political parties in taiwan 's government in march 2000 to chen shui - bian 's assertion of " one country on each side of the strait . � they are the author 's observations and reflections of the internal situation in taiwan and the cross - strait relations during the time when he " listened to what one said and watched what one did . "
since it took two years for these articles written two years ago to be published , it is obvious that the mainland has a very con@@ volu@@ ted and time - consuming reviewing system for research papers on taiwan . this shows the publication of " observing taiwan " has gone through an uph@@ ill struggle .
since a long time ago , chen k@@ ong@@ li has been taking an objective and truth - finding approach in his observation and study of taiwan . he did not restrict himself to any subjective and pre@@ conceived political framework and end@@ ea@@ vo@@ red to explore unique and tru@@ thful insights .
the reading of this book gives one an even deeper impression of this special characteristic .
since the early 1980s , the study on taiwan has become the " popular study " in mainland china . various research institutes emerged one after another and all kinds of scholars and experts made their appearances and showed their talent .
overseas , people generally divide the research institutes on taiwan in the mainland into the northern school and the southern school .
the northern school takes a relatively official stance with strong rhetor@@ ic . it more often assumes an over@@ bearing haw@@ k@@ ish tone in some particular historic stages or in major political developments .
on the other hand , research institutes on taiwan of the southern school are generally located in areas south of the yang@@ tze river , including shanghai and fu@@ jian .
japanese prime minister jun@@ ichiro ko@@ izumi 's " academic records " of " studying in london for two years " were exposed by the japanese media as an exaggeration .
the japanese newspaper " the weekly post " verified with the office of registrar at london university and found that during his nine - month stay in britain , ko@@ izumi only audited a few classes as a part - time student at the university and did not earn any academic degree .
the chinese domestic media , big and small , vied with one another in reporting or re@@ printing this scandal to the great grati@@ fication of the general public .
indeed , it is shocking that a prime minister of a country , imposing as he is , should fake his academic records to cheat his own countrymen .
it is all the more shameful that this should happen in the " imperialist " japan .
however , if we view it from another perspective , we may find something positive in this scandal .
moreover , these positive things are exactly what we lack and they also show the area where we urgently need to make improvements .
in recent years , we have been advocating " honesty and trust , " " building a sunshine government , " respecting people 's " right to information " and enhancing the " transparency " of the administration . however , the reality is far from our ideal .
come to think of it . the falsi@@ fication of a diploma by a country � s prime minister , while not a big deal by itself , can be exposed by the media and relent@@ lessly pursued .
in such a country , what else cannot be brought under the sunshine ?
in taiwan � s evening campaign rallies , major camps usually shuttle their people to the site in tourist buses . however ,
not long ago , when taiwan 's president chen shui - bian shouted " let 's win the election ! " at a campaign rally somewhere in the north of the island , more than half of the audience did not give him the due respect of shouting with him because most of the local people have some relatives or friends who have gone to invest in the mainland and the long overdue " three direct links " and the non - performing financial policy have many of them concerned .
if nothing unexpected happens , we can assume from opinion polls , underground w@@ agers and other signs at this countdown time to taiwan � s presidential election that chen - lu team will lose the election .
unless more sensational developments come up , such as a major pan - blue split - up or an even more embarrassing scandal , chen shui - bian , who fought such a hard battle of winning the power from lee t@@ eng - hui , will have proved that he has failed to effectively win the popularity in the past four years and that instead he has allowed the green camp to stage a continuous variety show of corruption and low taste before the public , which has consequently weakened the confidence of his supporters .
how is beijing going to deal with the pan - blue forces that may regain the power ?
first of all , we should understand that the pan - blue camp that may possibly regain the power is no longer the single big dominant party of the k@@ m@@ t but a combination of the blue and the orange and that there is the issue whether the internal tradition and the native faction can merge .
the current close cooperation during the election period cannot be regarded as necessary future relations .
if there are hopes of winning the election , internal restructuring will surely take considerable amount of time . the ensuing election of the legislative yuan at the end of the year will also make it very hard for the lien - so@@ ong administration to make any major changes in the cross - strait relations ,
unless it realizes that the improvement of the cross - strait relations can score points for taiwan � s internal politics and is also confident of producing a positive result within a short period of time which , most importantly , can be felt by the general public .
given this background , beijing should temporarily hold its efforts to push for the reunification and allow lien and so@@ ong , the two leaders of the " traditional blue camp , " some time to consolidate the internal situation .
more than half a century has passed since the united states conducted its first nuclear explosion in new m@@ exic@@ o in july 1945 and dropped two atomic bombs in japan in august of the same year .
although the arms race between the two super@@ powers of the united states and the soviet union led to a stock@@ pile of nuclear weapons sufficient for the destruction of the entire world , fortunately both parties realized the danger of a nuclear war and refr@@ ained from pushing the nuclear button .
after the soviet union was dissolved and the world entered the post - cold - war era , the danger of a large - scale nuclear war basically disappeared .
but meanwhile , the danger of nuclear proliferation increased rather than diminished .
the proliferation shows itself in two aspects .
in one case , some above - average countries with relatively rich resources and strength , out of their desire for regional supremacy , confrontation with their neighboring countries , safeguarding security or implementing blackmail diplomacy , are trying very hard to manufacture and possess nuclear weapons by all means .
in the other case , some non - state groups , especially the isl@@ amic extremists who harbor an intense hatred for the west , are also seeking small - size nuclear weapons by all means to carry out bloody terrorist attacks on the west with no regard to innocent civilians .
in response to this demand , there have emerged midd@@ lemen who engage in the transfer and sales of nuclear weapons and the related technologies , and " nuclear black markets . " moreover , their business is increasingly expanding in scope and has become an important part of the nuclear proliferation in the present world .
as a chinese who grew up in the hang@@ jia@@ hu region , images of rural areas and the peasant life in the old central east china still stay in my memory .
returning to my hometown after many years , i found the lush green farmland along shanghai - hang@@ zhou expressway is stre@@ w@@ n with three - stor@@ ied houses built by peasants themselves , but i seldom saw anyone working in the fields .
this came as a real surprise to me . it is hard to believe that such tremendous changes have taken place for those people and lands that i have never stopped missing while living abroad .
however , i was greatly surprised and shocked by some report@@ age and scholars ' field surveys on the conditions of rural china that i read recently on the internet .
i never knew that such an unimaginable dark side still exists in rural china and that the chinese peasants are still living such a hard life in humiliation and without rights .
in " chinese peasants : a survey , " a long report@@ age published by chen guid@@ i and his wife after the couple conducted a field survey in the rural areas of three provinces of an@@ hui , hen@@ an and he@@ bei , they voiced grievances on behalf of peasants and stirred up the chinese society .
based on a large number of facts that peasants were oppressed , exploited and even murdered for no apparent reasons by corrup@@ ted officials , they came to this conclusion : " when we came into closer contact with the chinese peasants , we felt such a shock and angu@@ ish that we had never felt before . the poverty , evils , helplessness , resistance , silence and sadness we witnessed were all beyond one � s imagination . "
these are truly heart - w@@ ren@@ ching words .
just as anticipated , malay@@ sian prime minister ab@@ dul@@ lah announced the dissolution of the parliament the day before yesterday and the general election for the new parliament will be held in the coming days .
to ab@@ dul@@ lah , this election will be an event of great significance in his political career . to the political situation in malaysia and its trend of development , the outcome of this election is also of landmark significance .
only four months have passed now since ab@@ dul@@ lah took over from ma@@ ha@@ thir last november .
in spite of this , he still decided to dissolve the parliament and hold the election ahead of schedule .
this at least has two implications : first , ab@@ dul@@ lah is satisfied with his job performance for the past four months and is confident about the intent of voters . second , he hopes to consolidate the foundation of his power by this means so as to emerge from the shadow of ma@@ ha@@ thir .
doub@@ tlessly , ab@@ dul@@ lah 's decision to hold a blitz election shows that he has already made a comprehensive assessment of the political situation in the country .
the current economy in malaysia is performing well and there is no issue that the opposition party can make a big case of or capit@@ alize to their advantages .
besides , since ab@@ dul@@ lah took office , he has taken some measures with relatively high publicity to fight corruption , such as arresting and prosecuting the former land and cooperative development minister k@@ as@@ it@@ ah g@@ addam on charges of graft . they not only earned him some favorable ac@@ claims but also made the public optimistic about the future anti - corruption operations .
in the meantime , he urged to improve the efficiency of civil services , which is another action to boost people � s morale .
since its establishment , the development and shaping of the european union have been strongly influenced by the french politics and culture .
seeking diplomatic independence and autonomy , the eu wants to be distinguished from the united states in its attitude and approach to handling international affairs . this guides the eu diplomatic policy and obviously reflects the subtle influence of france .
it is exactly for this reason that the international community , including china , russia and arab countries , all hope to see the rise of the eu as a completely independent force in international exchanges .
it must be admitted that since the late 1980s , the eu has indeed been working toward this goal in its diplomacy .
in december 1992 , all heads of state of the eu agreed unanimously at the ma@@ a@@ stric@@ ht summit that all member states would implement a common foreign policy so that they would speak in un@@ ison to the outside world .
however , the so - called " common foreign and security policy of the eu " met its first fi@@ asco two years later in handling the issue of bosnia .
from the ma@@ a@@ stric@@ ht summit up till now , the eu � s 10 - year diplomacy has achieved very little .
what is even worse is that the eu � s foreign policy utterly failed to withstand the test of major events .
the various positions the member states took on the u@@ .@@ s . war on iraq not only proved this but also revealed once again the eu 's fatal political f@@ law . that is , it can be easily divided and ruled by other big powers and then won over one after another .
on february 24 , president bush announced at the white house that he would support the constitutional amendment that bans same - sex marriage .
this is a clear shift from the equivoc@@ al attitude toward this issue he has adopted for months and represents an important development in politics during the u@@ .@@ s . presidential election year .
the constitutional amendment banning same - sex marriage is a very powerful political weapon in the newly emerged re@@ public@@ an headquarters in the american south , but it also has an enormous negative effect . since it is a heavy@@ weight cultural dispute that divides public opinions nationwide , it doub@@ tlessly will aggravate the political polarization in the united states and further distance the liberal - dominated east and west coasts .
for bush himself , who repeatedly claimed to be " a un@@ iter " not " a divi@@ der " during the 2000 election , this is obviously a broken promise .
moreover , as the young generation in the united states has become more and more liberal toward the homosex@@ uality issue , this act of bush , though effective in the short term , will do damages to the long - term interest of the re@@ public@@ an party .
bush 's new offensive of " constitutional amendment " can be described as his " sco@@ t@@ ched earth strategy " for this year 's presidential election .
bush resorted to this pl@@ oy because he is losing his ground on the two major issues of anti - terrorist war and economy / employment and has to open up a new battlefield in religious and cultural issues that divide public opinions in the nation .
the u@@ .@@ s . attitude so far remains cautious .
in other words , since maintaining the status quo in the taiwan strait can meet the long - term goal of the united states to strategically balance the power of the chinese mainland , the united states will avoid any political and military conflicts with china resulting from encouraging taiwan 's independence .
understand@@ ably , it is not likely that the united states will completely eliminate the space for taiwan to hold a referendum exactly as beijing requested , but it will also take some pre - warning measures out of considerations for its own interest .
recently , u@@ .@@ s . secretary of state pow@@ ell , out of his own initiative , reiterated the existing policy on taiwan and stated the u@@ .@@ s . opposition to taiwan 's independence .
this demonstration of position is interpreted by the public as aiming at deterring and preventing chen shui - bian from going to the extreme .
the recent remarks made by some u@@ .@@ s . think tank personnel with government connections and the u@@ .@@ s . deployment of a large number of spy ships to the taiwan strait in the coming days to spy on the military activities of both sides of the strait are indirect evidence that the united states is very much concerned with the situation in the taiwan strait .
it shows from another perspective that although the united stat@@ s will not completely prevent taiwan from holding the referendum as beijing requested , it is equally concerned with the uncertainty of the situation in the taiwan strait during this period .
any large - scale and one - on - one election eventually will have only one result . either chen shui - bian is lucky enough to get re@@ elected by a narrow margin , or lien chan re@@ claims the taiwan presidential office .
what makes one worried is that due to unequal access to information , people from all sectors of society in the chinese mainland seem to have not psychologically prepared for the possibility that chen shui - bian may still win the election .
in the event that the outcome of the election is not what has been expected , beijing will again find itself in an unnecessary passive situation .
an ancient arab saying goes : " one day 's turmoil is more horrible than a thousand years of tyr@@ anny . "
is this what the northeast asian countries are currently worried about ?
i think the answer is probably affirmative .
a famous research and development center close to washington d.@@ c . and funded by the u@@ .@@ s . government examined in a recent study the four policy options to deal with north korea 's nuclear crisis . they are engagement , containment and deterrence , economic sanctions , and pre@@ emptive strikes .
the attitude of the countries in the region toward these tactics is the focus of this survey .
in addition , the survey also analyzes the threats posed by north korea 's nuclear weapons program based on the possibility of nuclear attacks and the potential damage they can cause as perceived by the peoples of north korea 's neighboring countries and their sense of fear .
both china and russia consider the danger of north korea 's use of nuclear weapons low or very low , while japan and south korea regard it as a significant threat .
all northeast asian countries agree that they should keep engaging north korea .
japan , on the other hand , supports containment and deterrence . other countries also consider the strategy of containment and deterrence acceptable under certain circumstances .
singapore cares very much about its international rankings and pays year - long attention to country rankings in various areas released by the european and u@@ .@@ s . agencies .
constantly being at the top of lists naturally adds to our interest in keeping track of rankings .
however , being no@@ . 1 in every area has its own share of trouble .
in the opinion of most of our countrymen , you appear worried about being a los@@ er if you pay too much attention to rankings , yet you look arrogant if you show off your rankings .
therefore , people advise us that we should live a more elegant and carefree life and had better stand alo@@ of from the worldly success .
as many people in the past would not de@@ ign to pay any attention to the rankings , there appeared a funny phenomenon that people no longer seemed to regard being " no@@ . 1 in the world " as good news but rather tended to treat it as something embarrassing .
however , things have changed back in the past year or two .
we feel un@@ sure of the long - term competitiveness of our country , and people in all walks of life also worry about their job security .
with this uncertainty , we no longer talk in an elegant and carefree manner as we used to .
in the intense global competition , being too elegant and carefree can give others a chance to catch up and surpass you and you may easily fall behind from your top rankings in every area .
on the outside , bush appears to be pretty loyal to ch@@ en@@ ey . at the meeting of re@@ public@@ an governors at the end of last month , bush still promised solemnly that he would choose none other than ch@@ en@@ ey for his running mate .
however , he also said half jokingly that just as in 2000 , he has placed ch@@ en@@ ey in charge of finding a candidate for vice president .
ch@@ en@@ ey , who always h@@ ides his talents and keeps a low profile , has made frequent public appearances lately in interviews with the media , denying that he will be replaced .
but he still left some room for himself .
he said he would not hesitate to bow out should he have health problems or feel himself a real burden on the president .
ch@@ en@@ ey , 63 , has a history of four heart attacks .
recently it is widely rumored that the u@@ .@@ s . military has actually encircl@@ ed os@@ ama , the master@@ mind behind the sep@@ t.@@ 11 attacks , and is only waiting for the right time to arrest him .
as the voting for the presidential election is on november 2 , it is said that the p@@ ent@@ agon has already arranged for the good show of capturing os@@ ama alive to be put on in october .
however , a long delay may give rise to h@@ it@@ ches . should os@@ ama slip through the net , there may be no end of trouble for the future .
it seems that gi@@ uli@@ ani , after all , is pretty much the tr@@ ump card that bush may count on for winning the votes .
the competitors for the 2004 u@@ .@@ s . presidential election have been confirmed : the democratic candidate k@@ erry challenging the incumbent re@@ public@@ an president bush .
they have started " warming up " activities such as campaign advertisements and election debates prior to the november election .
their confrontation either orally or in written form may center on the three major topics of war , economy and social issues .
bush believes that the war is closely linked with the national security of the united states . either sending troops to top@@ ple s@@ addam or fight against terror , it is all for the sake of ensuring the security of the united states . therefore , he tells his countrymen time and again : " we are at war . "
k@@ erry , of course , will point out that it is wrong for bush to abuse the erroneous intelligence that iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction to launch the war on iraq .
speaking of economy , k@@ erry thinks bush 's tax relief plan helps the rich and fails to create new jobs .
bush shows k@@ erry : aren 't the u@@ .@@ s . economic figures going up ?
as for the social issues such as the relationship between man and woman , bush opposes same - sex marriage and abortion , and supports death penalty , whereas , k@@ erry is also ag@@ anist same - sex marriage but supports abortion and opposes death penalty .
how bush and k@@ erry present their own viewpoints on these three major issues to the voters and convince them via ads , television and speeches will be all the political shows the two are going to put on for the next eight months .
however , on the diplomatic issues , k@@ erry has more room to show off his acting skills .
according to statistics , young people who choose to commit suicide are mostly teenagers 15 to 19 years of age , but it is also not uncommon for children as young as 10 to 14 years old .
academic pressure is generally believed to be the cause of child and teenage suicide . however , studies find that emotional problems , especially those pertaining to sexual love and parental relationship , are actually the main reasons that local young people commit suicide .
academic pressure and disappointment resulting from failed expectation also certainly per@@ tain to the category of communication between parents and children .
the pressure of getting into a higher school is an inevitable burden on local school children during their growing up . sometimes the pressure is self - induced , while more often the pressure is imposed on children by their parents .
parents demand children have good academic performance and compare their own children with other children at every chance . although the demand of academic excellence puts quite a lot of pressure on children , the mediation and communication behind the pressure are the true indicators of the relationship between parents and children .
if parents beat and sc@@ old their children or show blame on their faces when children 's performance is less than perfect , or even make children feel they are dis@@ appointments , they will doub@@ tlessly push their children to helplessness and desper@@ ation .
it is known that many young students who need counseling became mentally disturbed after they were pushed into desper@@ ation by their parents ' over - expectations .
the success and rapid development of singapore make parents feel their children are much better provided for than they themselves were and therefore they naturally expect their children to perform better than they themselves did .
more often than not , parents forget that they actually might not be particularly outstanding in all fields when they themselves were children .
at the age of one year and a half , most children are sent to boarding nurseries set up by various agencies or work units for a nominal fee . children come home only once a week or even once a month .
today , singapore is facing the social issues of a declining birth rate and an aging population .
the young generation is too busy with keeping their modern life style and fashionable material comfor@@ ts to respond to the government 's call for early marriage and child@@ bearing .
i have a bold proposal to make : the government should take care of infants .
the people need only to be concerned about child@@ birth not child@@ care .
on the one hand , the government will sponsor setting up boarding nurseries and kindergartens and change elementary schools to full day care even with three meals provided , all for a nominal fee that citizens can afford .
this will not only create jobs for the unemployed , but also relieve the government from worrying whether such measures as infant bonuses , extended maternity leave , quality of m@@ aids , and tax rebates will work or not .
what beijing needs to do is not only acting as the chief leader of the six - nation talks but also developing strategic deployment as soon as possible to take precautions in the long - term interest of china in the korean peninsula .
specifically , beijing should urge north korea to abandon its nuclear weapons on the one hand , and start with reforming the kim j@@ ong il regime and lead it toward modern civilization on the other so that it can eliminate the danger of a nuclear war in northeast asia and keep the status quo in the korean peninsula , gaining more cl@@ out for long - term strategic negotiations with the united states .
in spite of its fierce fac@@ ade , py@@ ong@@ yang is actually weak inside and long@@ s for economic development and integration into the international community .
only this longing is often demonstrated by an outward appearance of aggres@@ siveness , ir@@ rationality and complete lack of conformity with international rules .
in fact , beijing has been using its influence and economic aid measures for some time to force py@@ ong@@ yang to change its position that is not in conformity with international rules .
but this action still needs planning in all aspects .
beijing 's aid to py@@ ong@@ yang should not be limited to the economic field but rather be expanded to other social fields . the objective should not be limited to forcing py@@ ong@@ yang to abandon its nuclear program but rather should lead it toward modern civilization .
when k@@ erry first entered the arena , nobody thought he would have too much of a chance . at the time , all the spotlight was on dean , the former governor of ver@@ mont .
however , k@@ erry emerged like a dark horse in january prior to the i@@ ow@@ a ca@@ uc@@ uses and took the victory at the ca@@ uc@@ uses and pri@@ mar@@ ies in the two most crucial states of i@@ ow@@ a and new ha@@ mp@@ shire .
in the following pri@@ mar@@ ies of other states , k@@ erry basically never lost except in the home states of other participating candidates .
within only six weeks , k@@ erry became the front - runner from a candidate with almost no hope . all his rivals , including g@@ ep@@ hard@@ t , li@@ e@@ ber@@ man , clar@@ k , dean and ed@@ wards dropped out of race one after another , making people take a fresh look at k@@ erry for his political char@@ is@@ ma .
in his 19 years of career as a senator , k@@ erry has always supported abortion and environmental protection policies and opposed tax relief plans that benefit the rich . he is dedicated to raising the minimum wage and finding a solution to global warming .
his working experience in washington shows his willingness to confront social challenges and his courage in def@@ ying authorities and pursuing values with no fear of dis@@ pleasing the interest of the minority .
china 's policy of reform and opening up started with agriculture . rural residents were the earliest beneficiaries of this policy .
however , in the late 1990s , the agricultural reform basically came to a standstill due to the dramatic shift in economic policy toward towns and cities , and the gap between urban and rural areas was further widened .
as time passes , two entirely different worlds have emerged in china , one is the highly prosperous urban china , and the other is the impoverished rural china .
to use a chinese official j@@ arg@@ on , the widening gap between urban and rural areas in china is " an issue of development , " and must therefore be solved through continued development .
in other words , the development of the coastal areas and urban areas in china should continue without being hindered by the problems in rural areas .
however , seeing some metropolitan cities undergoing small changes in a year and big changes in three years , people could not but ask why some impoverished areas have seen no changes in the past decades ?
of course , we should recognize the fact that urban and rural areas have very different ways of development . but the question is when large amount of funds are invested in urban construction and encouragement and support are given to the wealthy middle class , have rural residents , who make up 70 % of the entire population , also been given the attention and emphasis ?
in theory , the chinese governments , both past and present , have undeni@@ ably paid due attention to the issues of agriculture , rural areas and peasants .
however , as the conditions in rural areas have been more and more deteriorating in recent years , the emphasis given is obviously less and less adequate .
in any country , police , prosecutors and courts should not only be symbols of justice and fairness but also form the most important system of safeguarding social stability .
but unfortunately , they have become symbols of corruption in china .
according to the latest report from the national auditing department , the audi@@ tion of the financial expenditures in the public security agencies in 26 provinces and cities last year shows that the public security agencies in the country had illegally collected a total of 16.5 billion yuan in fines and penalties .
the crisis of trust in police , prosecutors and courts has now come out into the open .
the cases of liu yong and sun zh@@ ig@@ ang and the recent " b@@ m@@ w " incident all reflect this profound crisis of trust .
the " b@@ m@@ w " incident is even more typical .
people are far more concerned with this issue than their concern with s@@ ars during the s@@ ars period .
in fact , what people are concerned is not the " b@@ m@@ w " incident itself , but the fact they could no longer trust the entire judicial system .
being clearly aware of that , the relevant department soon put a tight lid on the media .
but , the problem is still there .
the second round of six - nation talks on north korean nuclear issue ended the way it was generally expected .
during the talks , all parties concerned got together and explored the peripheral issues of the peninsula nuclear crisis and reached consensus on holding the third round of talks before the end of june this year , setting up a working group and other matters .
however , the talks yielded no progress on those substantive issues like how north korea should scrap its nuclear weapons program and how the united states should afterwards ensure the political and military security in north korea and provide north korea energy aid . instead it gave the feeling that the " fast knot " only got more tightened with each attempt to pull it loose .
both of the two prot@@ agon@@ ists , the united states and north korea , showed no concession ; and each stayed firm with its basic position .
what draws attention , however , is the u@@ .@@ s . attitude at the talks that showed no urgency to solve the problems and gave the impression of " foot@@ dragging . "
this tactic that the united states showed is closely linked with the new developments of the current international situation and the interests it is seeking in these new developments .
the united states has never seen so many corporate ce@@ os j@@ ailed since ro@@ os@@ evel@@ t became the president .
is the recent exposure of a string of crimes in quick succession a result of co@@ incid@@ ences or the explosion of the public or investor 's pent - up fur@@ y over corporate crimes and other illegal activities in the past three years ?
there may not be a simple answer , but it is a fact that the criminal activities of many corporations are exposed recently .
this bo@@ des well for the recovery of economy and especially the restoration of investor confidence .
as the late 1990s might be the most chaotic and also the most elu@@ sive period in the history of the u@@ .@@ s . commerce , the sooner its impact van@@ ishes , the better .
once the curtain falls , the names of some companies are bound to fade into history , eventually ending up only in textbooks of business schools .
whereas , other companies , such as ty@@ co and mc@@ i , will work hard at reorganization to welcome the new round of economic growth under the leadership of new management teams .
when will the new round of economic growth come ?
as a ce@@ o , you may not have the answer .
but this doesn 't matter , because federal reserve chairman green@@ span doesn 't know the answer either .
the bush administration wants to adopt key@@ nes@@ i@@ anism to stimulate economy by greatly increasing expenditures ( in particular , national defense expenditures ) on the one hand , and drastically reducing taxes on the other .
internationally , the bush administration continues to promote free trade while its trade deficit has hit a new high of 5@@ 49 billion u@@ .@@ s . dollars .
however , the substantial tax - cuts failed to bring about any significant growth in investment and consumer spending .
according to the new key@@ nes@@ ians represented by the famous british economist god@@ ley , the u@@ .@@ s . economy has been in such a m@@ ire that bush 's financial strategy will not be able to salvage it .
they think that the so - called " law of markets " is only an illusion that inevitably leads to profits for the minority and losses for the majority .
people used to think that in the entire world the so - called profit - making minority are all in the united states , while the loss - taking majority are all in developing countries .
now , things turn out to be otherwise .
many in the u@@ .@@ s . economics community think that in addition to the u@@ .@@ s . - based multin@@ ation@@ als , india and china have also become prominent current winners of globalization .
india has taken over the service economy , while china domin@@ ates in the manufacturing sector .
while people focus their concern on the mass transfer of the u@@ .@@ s . capital and manufacturing equipment to china , they fail to see the advantage of china 's labor market which is characterized by high skills and low costs .
first , whether the current situation in taiwan is within or beyond beijing 's assessment .
how beijing made its assessment is known only to beijing itself , but the result of the assessment can be inf@@ erred by outsiders from what can be openly observed .
for four years , the pro - independence camp headed by chen shui - bian and ann@@ ette lu has demonstrated its position in clear terms and efficient operation and actively proceeded with taiwan 's independence .
in contrast , beijing adopted a nearly routine tone occasionally punc@@ tu@@ ated by high pitch sounds and appeared indifferent to the progress of taiwan 's independence .
however , it has taken a sharp turn since last fall . the magnitude of change is evident in the past few months as its capacity of handling took a wide departure from what it used to be in the 1990s .
judging from this , it can be assumed that the current situation in taiwan is within its assessment .
second , take a look at the diplomacy with taiwan .
the developments of the situation in the taiwan strait depend on whether major countries like the united states adopt a pro - beijing or pro - tai@@ pei attitude .
since all countries are open about their attitudes , the answer is very clear .
as of today , all countries have not only been getting closer to beijing with more concrete exchanges and growing more distant away from tai@@ pei with less substantial exchanges , they have also started to give " mild but significant " advice to taiwan 's democracy that has until now enjoyed praises .
