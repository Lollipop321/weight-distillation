us begins photograph@@ ing and finger@@ printing foreign visitors
washington , jan 5 (@@ af@@ p@@ ) - the united states began photograph@@ ing and finger@@ printing foreign visitors as singapore - home to one of asia 's largest airports - endorsed demands for armed guards on planes to counter terrorist threats .
the intensified checks on arriving foreign visitors by washington coinci@@ ded with rising concerns about global air security that have forced the cancellation of several flights to and from the united states over the past week .
photograph@@ ing and finger@@ printing are required only of foreign visitors who must obtain visas to enter the united states - an expected 23 million arrivals this year .
citizens from 28 countries , mostly in europe , are exempt from the above - said photograph@@ ing and finger@@ printing procedures , according to the department of homeland security , which is responsible for the united states visitor and immigrant status indicator technology , or us - visit .

" one of the primary responsibilities of any government is to make sure that their borders are secure , and we 're doing that with this program . i think it 's very in@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive . it takes about 15 seconds and no one seemed to mind . " ridge said when interviewed by n@@ b@@ c .
by 2005 , every port of entry on land , sea , and air will have the photographic and finger@@ printing technology .
all us visas and passports will eventually include photos and fingerprints - " bi@@ ometric identi@@ fi@@ ers . "
the program is coming into force after the united states raised its nationwide terror alert last december .

" the reasons are the same old ones - m@@ istr@@ ust and very high demands set by both sides , " los@@ yu@@ kov told inter@@ fax yesterday following his talks with senior chinese officials .
y@@ oon raised the possibility of a prolonged delay after north korea reiterated its demand for a commitment from the united states for concession before the new round of six - nation talks .
washington accused py@@ ong@@ yang of setting pre - conditions for the new round of six - nation talks .
the united states is seeking a commitment from north korea to give up its nuclear weapons program .
north korea says it will freeze its nuclear facilities if washington lifts economic sanctions against py@@ ong@@ yang and resumes energy aid .

as a left - leaning former governor of a northern state , dean could be at a disadvantage in the south facing retired general w@@ es@@ ley clar@@ k . however , car@@ ter 's support might gain him chances to win the more conservative , religion - conscious south in the us .
car@@ ter said in a recent television interview that he saw dean as the most likely democratic candidate to run against bush in the presidential elections .

taiwan and japan are both democratic countries sharing obligations and responsibilities to work together for the consolidation of democracy in asia .
in order to carry forward democratic values , our government will establish the " taiwan democratic fund " , one of whose priority tasks is international cooperation with other political parties .
it is the hope of the democratic progressive party that through the fund it can join hands with other democratic parties in other countries in sharing experiences of democratic development and contributing to peace , stability , and prosperity in asia so that the ideal of the " democratic league in asia " will come into reality as soon as possible .
given today 's rapidly changing international situation and the fact that a slight move by a regional force in one part may affect the situation as a whole , the security of all countries face tough challenges .
in asia pacific , since the united states launched its war against iraq last month , the nuclear north korea test fired many times its missiles over the territorial air of japan . furthermore , china has long been actively engaged with arms expansion , deploying ballistic missiles targeting taiwan .
all these constitute severe threats to the security of taiwan and japan and the asia pacific region at large .
these topics in relation to the consolidation of democracy and the maintaining of peace demand a formal security mechanism for discussion and resolution .
today 's meeting marks the first formal dialog between the democratic progressive party , the ruling party of taiwan , and the japanese ruling party liberal democratic party as well as parliamentarians from other political parties . it goes without saying that today 's meeting holds great significance .
i also hope that apart from bilateral dialog between taiwan and japan , asia pacific countries like the united states , japan , and korea will work together to help establish the " dialog mechanism for security , " and support taiwan 's participation in regional multilateral dialog group@@ ings , in an effort to carry forward the spirit of " cooperative security . "
today marks an important moment that encourages us to continue our journey along the reform process . we fully recognize all party comrades ' contributions in emb@@ od@@ ying the party will and working for the realization of reform objectives .
" political parties ' withdrawal from the media " is the very basic requirement to carry out media reform and a consistent ideal held on to by the democratic progressive party . our taking the helm of the state will only serve to quicken the pace of reform , but never shall it become our hindr@@ ance or burden .
we understand that to push forward the objective the comrades assuming office in the party shall first withdraw from media operations . it is only a small step in media reform , but it will also be a crucial one .
during the martial law period when media was controlled by the state , many of our comrades participated in the tough preparation work to launch channel 4 and local stations in an effort to fight for more open media space . by doing so , they hoped to break out of the limits and provide a driving force for the improvement of the media environment .
for example , comrade cai ton@@ grong worked extremely hard for the birth of the 4th wireless tv station so that the " people 's tv " was created .
this had great impact on the overall media environment . it ended channel 3 's long - time monopoly , and created more space for the development of cable tv stations .
however , we need to understand that in certain historical cont@@ ex@@ ts along the process of reform we have to take certain actions . therefore , today when free media is absolutely guaranteed , a clear indication of the achievement of periodical reform objectives , we must make the choice and sacrifice in some cases in order for the reform process to move forward .
the central standing committee declared that all comrades assuming office in the party shall withdraw from media operations by september 5 when the legislature holds the next session , setting examples to fulfill their promise to the people .
we are very pleased to see our comrades put the party ideal and objective in the first place . many comrades including cai ton@@ grong , zhang jun@@ hong , zhou qing@@ yu , hou shu@@ isheng , g@@ ao m@@ eng@@ ding , huang nai@@ hui and shen ming@@ gong who have made many contributions in the democratic movement have chosen to put media reform in front of personal gains .
to take the helm of the state is not to enjoy power but to shoulder added responsibility .
as the democratic progressive party takes the helm of the state , perhaps there could be setbacks or twists and turns , but we are always able to turn challenges into our driving force , steadily leading taiwan long the way of deepening democracy and accepting such global universal values as democracy , peace , and stability .
for it is always our belief that it is just the people who are the master of this country . the responsibility of the democratic progressive party is to advance the party spirit of " in@@ corrup@@ tibility , diligence , love for homeland " into the bright future of " reform , progress , good life , " in order to lay down a foundation of lasting stability and durable peace for the 23 million tai@@ w@@ anese .
the democratic progressive party have long played the role of government assistant in expanding taiwan 's diplomatic space and have achieved great results .
though the chinese communist party never stops containment , we never retreat , because we grasp our own destiny . even without rich resources , the democratic progressive party works steadily for the expansion of taiwan 's participation in the international affairs .
" multiple - entity diplomacy " is the principal axis of the overall diplomatic strategy of the democratic progressive party . over the past year , on the basis of " union of freedom and democracy in asia , " we have successfully shared experiences with other countries and political parties in the region on issues like economic challenges in east asia , democratic reform of political parties , eradication of money politics , handling of globalization and poverty , political publicity and communications , youth participation in politics , etc.
i will formally succeed as chairman of the " union of freedom and democracy in asia " next march . i hope to create more opportunities for taiwan to expand its international space in my new capacity of the leader of an international organization .
furthermore , the democratic progressive party has actively participated in related work since joining the international league for freedom as a formal member last year .
apart from designating an official to serve as human rights commissioner in london headquarters secretariat , the democratic progressive party will cooperate with other member parties to hold political reform workshops in l@@ atin america and europe .
the party celebrated its 17th birthday on september 28 .
entering its 17th year , the democratic progressive party has always held on to its democratic ideal and is full of strengths for reform and advancement .
we have always stood on the side of democratic reform ; therefore we have won the confidence of the taiwan people . furthermore , for the same reason , the responsibility on our shoulders is all the more serious and significant .
three years ago when we took the helm of the state , the former ruling party had done six amendments to the constitution through difficulties in the 1990s .
from the handling of the overall re@@ election of the legislature in 1991 , to the handling of direct presidential election in 1994 , to the freezing of governmental organizations in 1997 , all the way to the abolition of the permanent national assembly in 2000 , the difficult road forward along the constitution amendment process had marked the tra@@ jec@@ tory of the taiwan people 's right@@ ful journey demanding the strengthening of sovereignty and democracy .
if we take the 1996 direct presidential election as the sign of the birth of taiwan as an independent sovereign democratic state , then this " complete " nation will be ten years of age in 2006 .
through ten years ' practical work , we need to think about what we are going to seek after in the next step as an independent sovereign state .
i need to say that during the next phase we must call for deepening democracy and more effective constitutional system , so that we can lead the taiwan people to face serious challenges in the new century .
asia is the biggest continent in the world , occupying nearly 30 % of the land mass in the world , hosting 60 % of the world 's population , and amounting to a quarter of the economic volume of the world . therefore asia should and can make significant contributions to the world peace and development .
asia boasts a splendid long history . the yellow and yang@@ tze rivers reaches , the indu@@ s and gang@@ es rivers reaches , and the e@@ uph@@ rates and ti@@ gr@@ is rivers reaches are all famous birth@@ places of the human civilization .
in the long development of history , the asian people auth@@ ored splendid chapters for the development of human civilization .
entering the modern times , asia has experienced great changes and sufferings . the asian peoples fought unswervingly for national liberation and development and scored great achievements .
however , there is still a long way ahead before the realization of asian rejuvenation .
to strengthen cooperation and achieve development and win - win results is the only way leading towards asian rejuvenation and where the fundamental interests of the asian people lie .
in the new situation of the new century , the development of asia faces new opportunities .
peace and stability remains to be the themes of the current times . the overall peaceful international situation provides a favorable external condition to asian development .
the deepening of economic globalization , the rapid advancement of global scientific and technological revolution , and the optimal re@@ grouping of international production factors and the quickened pace of industry transformation are all conducive to asian nations ' efforts in utilizing international capital , drawing in advanced technology , expanding international markets , and promoting the development of domestic economy .
asia is rich in resources and boasts huge markets . it is the region with the greatest economic liv@@ eliness in the world and holds great potentials .
huge population and being less developed are two basic characteristics of the situation of china .
china has a population of 1.3 billion . no matter how small the problem , if you multi@@ ply it by 1.3 billion , it becomes a very big problem indeed ; and no matter how impressive the financial and material resources , if you divide them by 1.3 billion , you get a very , very small per capita amount .
this is something which china 's leaders must always keep firmly in mind .
to solve the problem of the 1.3 billion people , we have to rely on ourselves and nobody else .
since the founding of the people 's republic , we have achieved much in our national reconstruction . at the same time we have made a few det@@ ours and missed some opportunities .
by 1978 , with the adoption of the reform and opening up policies , we had ultimately found the right path of development .
the chinese people 's path of independently building socialism with chinese characteristics .
the essence of this path of development is to mobilize all positive factors , emancipate and develop the productive forces , and respect and protect the freedom of the chinese people to pursue happiness .
china 's reform and opening up have spread from rural areas to the cities , from the economic field to the political , cultural , and social aren@@ as .
each and every step forward is designed in the final analysis to release the g@@ ushing vitality of labor , knowledge , technology , managerial expertise and capital , and allow all sources of social wealth to flow to the fullest extent .
over the past few years , the world has been undergoing profound changes , seeing rapid scientific and technological adv@@ ancements , increasing global productivity , and closer links in a global market , thus creating great opportunities for the development of all countries .
however , problems such as power politics , region conflicts , terrorism , contagious epidemics , and deteriorating environment continue to threaten global stability and development .
the negative impacts of economic globalization increase the risks as developing countries try to achieve economic and social development and their prices grow . some developing countries even face the danger of being margin@@ alized .
though the global economy is gradually recovering now , many uncertainties remain .
the do@@ ha round of multilateral trade negotiations suffered setbacks . complicated matters such as trade protectionism increased developing countries difficulties .
we are glad to see many developing countries are working hard to reform and have achieved conspicuous results .
in the international arena , developing countries strengthen their unity and cooperation , relying on the non@@ aligned movement and the group of 77 , working hard to safeguard their own right@@ ful interests and change the unfair international political and economic order , thus becoming an important force to promote democratization in the international relations .
at the same time , exchange and cooperation between developing countries have achieved rich results , with mutual economic exchange growing closer .
from the and@@ es to the me@@ kong river , from the mag@@ ri@@ bu league to the establishment of the african union , south - south cooperation has enjoyed continued enrichment , perfection and renewal in terms of content and form , and mechanism and means .
the past year saw the continued all - round development of sino - canadian friendly cooperation .
the bilateral trade volume continued to grow , with the total trade volume reaching nearly us $ 10 billion .
high - level exchanges were frequent . important members of the canadian government including foreign minister , defense minister , environmental minister , and international cooperation minister visited china in succession . the chairman of the supreme people 's court and minister of commerce of china visited canada in succession . what 's more important , the two prime ministers successfully exchanged visits .
premier wen ji@@ abao 's rescent visit to canada held great significance . a visit that formed a connecting link between the preceding and the following , and carried on the past and opened a way for the future , premier wen 's visit instil@@ led new energy to the further development of sino - canadian relations and laid down a sound foundation for bilateral friendly cooperation in a more extensive scope and greater depths .
china and canada will continue to strengthen cooperation in political , economic , cultural and educational , science and technological fields , in an effort o double total bilateral trade volume by 2010 .
overseas compatriots , friends ,
though living overseas , you have always cared about the homeland , interested in the construction and development in the motherland . at each and every crucial moment , you share happiness and worries with the people in the homeland . your hearts are linked with the hearts of the people in the motherland .
last year when some areas of china suffered from the outbreak of s@@ ars and the attack of floods , you extended sincere care and best wishes to the people in the motherland through the internet , correspondence , telephone and donation . chinese communities organized many large - scale donations and charity performances . you sent congratul@@ ation tele@@ graph@@ s , letters and cards after the successful flight of the shen@@ zhou v manned spacecraft , encouraged by and proud of the achievements of china 's aerospace technology .
during premier wen ji@@ abao 's visit to canada , hundreds of compatriots living in canada and overseas students bra@@ ved cold wind and rain to welcome the premier at the airport and the capit@@ ol hill . we saw many emotionally moving scenes at the time .
i hereby would like to extend my sincere gratitude to you . i believe you will continue to contribute even more to the prosperity of china , to the development of sino - canadian relations , and for the final reunification and great rejuvenation of china .
first , strengthen political mutual confidence and deepen strategic cooperation .
china and france , as permanent members of the security council of the united nations , are both influential nations in international affairs .
both countries support the promotion of a multipolar world , call for maintaining the authority of the united nations , and are ready to promote the establishment of a new international political and economic order in the interests of all the peoples in the world .
both countries share extensive consensus and common interests in terms of the challenges faced by the mankind and in terms of properly dealing with important international affairs .
we are ready to strengthen dialog and consultation and conduct close cooperation with france in the important areas of anti - terrorism , non - proliferation , cracking down on transnational crime , promoting common development , and strengthening the role of the united nations , in an effort to maintain world peace and promote common development .
second , strengthen economic and trade cooperation , achieve mutual benefit and mutual complement@@ arity .
china is the biggest developing country in the world with large markets . now china is comm@@ ited to its modernization drive .
france is a developed country , its economy and science and technology occupying a leading position in the world , and boasting cutting - edge technologies in many areas .
our two economies are highly mutually complementary . our economic and trade cooperation holds great potentials .
since the founding of new china , the chinese government has always attached great importance to the development of sino - african relations and has developed a series of policies .
we always hold on to the five principles of peaceful coexistence and respect african countries independent choice of their own political system and development path ; we provide what we can to african countries to conduct economic and technological cooperation ; we support unity and cooperation of african countries to work together towards prosperity ; we call for the international community to attach importance to the peace and stability in africa and support african countries to participate in international affairs on an equal footing ; and we strengthen sino - african consultation and cooperation in an effort to jointly safeguard interests of developing countries .
sino - african friendship has a long history and strikes root in the hearts of the people .
since the founding of new china , we have always unswervingly supported the national liberation cause of africa . it is our sincere hope to help african countries with the development of their economies .
chinese experts , doctors , teachers , and workers dispatched to africa work shoulder by shoulder and live happily with local populations like brothers and sisters .
china and african countries understand and support each other in international affairs and have become partners of mutual confidence .
the chinese people will never forget it was just under the great support of the many developing countries including african nations that china successfully resumed its legal position in the united nations at the 26th un assembly in 1971 .
over the recent years , personnel exchanges at all levels and in various fields between china and africa have been gradually deepened . sino - african economic and trade cooperation have been rapidly growing scoring many achievements in cultural , educational , health , science and technology , and sports areas . the sino - african cooperation forum formed early in the new century provides a new mechanism for the further development of sino - african relations and deepening of cooperation .
china and africa have decided to establish a new partnership of long - term stability featuring equality and mutual benefit . the sino - african friendly cooperation is entering into a new phase of all - round development .
seven years after president ni@@ xon 's visit to china and the publishing of the sino - us shanghai communiqu é , the car@@ ter administration accepted the chinese position on the taiwan issue , and china and the united states established diplomatic relations .
this and the successful visit by deng xia@@ oping to the united states ushered in a new chapter in sino - us relations .
china and the united states cont@@ ended he@@ at@@ edly on the taiwan issue early in the re@@ agan administration .
through tough negotiations , the two governments published the famous 8/@@ 17 communiqu é , reaching an agreement as to solving the issue of us arms sales to taiwan on a step - by - step basis .
the shanghai communiqu é , the sino - us communiqu é to establish diplomatic relations , and the 8/@@ 17 communiqu é together constitute the political corner stones of sino - us relations .
over the ten years after the establishment of diplomatic relations , sino - us relations had remained stable with bilateral exchange and cooperation in various fields gradually increasing though the two countries sometimes cont@@ ended on the taiwan issue and other matters .
at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s , dramatic changes happened in east europe and the soviet union dis@@ integrated . with the cold war coming to an end , the international situation has seen the most profound changes since ww@@ ii .
the united states led others to impose sanctions against china , announced to sell 160 f@@ -@@ 16 fighters to taiwan , linked human rights to m@@ f@@ n treatment , and allowed the visit by lee t@@ eng - hui . all these caused the bilateral relations to fall to the nad@@ ia .
with the rapid development of the chinese economy , china 's stat@@ ure in the international community continues to rise .
more and more americ@@ ans have become clear that the improvement and development of the bilateral relations is in the interests of both countries .
half a year ago in the same hall , we successfully launched the six - party talks process and specified the direction for the peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue .
over this half year , incessant dialog@@ s and consultations have been done between the parties , through which large in - depth preparation work has been done for the launch of the new round of talks , and during which mutual understanding of each other 's stand has been bet@@ tered .
now each party is hoping to see the second round of talks go into concrete content and achieve tangible results . all parties recognize each other 's concerns can be resolved through coordinated steps and hope to keep on the peace process launched by the six - party talks .
all these constitute the important basis our talks today .
the significance of the second round of talks is to begin discussion of concrete contents , marking a new step forward for the peace process .
this round of talks involves how to decide on the detailed objectives in solving the nuclear issue , discussion on the first phase of measures to resolve the nuclear issue , and study of how the talks shall go on .
with the deepening of the talks , we are going to face more difficulties and challenges . however , it is indeed our historical responsibility . the international community put high expectations on us .
the six parties meet here , a clear indication of the strong political will to seek peace of our six governments and peoples .
our talks are aimed at enlarg@@ ing consensus but not highlighting differences ; at resolving problems but not exacerb@@ ating conflicts .
it is the belief of the chinese side that the parties are able to recognize the peace mission on their shoulders and reduce their differences based on mutual respect and flexibility , with a constructive attitude , and under the spirit of cooperation and understanding .
the second round of six - party talk in beijing has completed the pre - defined agenda following more than three days of consultation .
i would like to extend my gratitude to the governments and heads of delegation , to the delegates and staff , for their contribution .
if we say the first round of talks decided on the general goal of non - nu@@ clear@@ ization of the korean peninsula , then this round is significant in that the dialog with concrete contents has begun , a new step forward towards the realization of the general goal .
the parties conducted in - depth and constructive discussions in the talks , presenting valuable ideas and making positive policy announcements through intelligent and reasonable discussion of means and steps of resolution .
the talks have achieved some helpful results , especially a consensus reached at for the next round of talks and the establishment of a working group , which is important to promote the peace process .
my dear colleagues , peace and development are the themes of our great times .
all the peoples of the six countries present need peace , desire peace , and love peace . all the people in the world need peace , desire peace , and love peace .
the international community has its eye on beijing and on di@@ aoy@@ utai over the past three days . great expectations have been put on this round of talks .
perhaps some may think the results of this round are not rich enough and the process is not fast enough .
in my opinion , this round of talks was started against the backdrop of lack of mutual confidence between the parties concerned and difference in their stands further increased .
it is the consistent position of the chinese government on the taiwan issue that the basic policy of " peaceful reunification and one country , two systems " must be adhered .
in this connection , we have exerted all our efforts , demonstrated our greatest sincerity , and done a lot of work .
however , our efforts are challenged by the taiwan authority and the " taiwan independence " movement .
we respect taiwan people 's democratic appeal , but we oppose any " taiwan independence " activities by the taiwan authority and " taiwan independence " activists under the name of democracy to separate taiwan from the motherland .
the reason why we have clearly stated our determination and purpose to safeguard the unity of the motherland is to maintain the peace and stability in the strait .
we have stated that we will try our best to achieve peaceful reunification of the motherland so long as there is a single ray of hope .
we appreciate president bush 's re@@ it@@ eration of the one china stand , which is a clear signal to the " taiwan independence " activists .
" the 3/@@ 20 peace referendum shall be carried out in order to prevent china from invading taiwan using force and unilaterally change the current situation . " the taiwan authority leader claimed .
it is sheer slander against the mainland 's peace efforts and a provocation committed against the relations across the strait .
the real threat to taiwan security now comes not from the mainland , but from the " taiwan independence " separatist movement blat@@ antly carried out by the taiwan authority .
the " taiwan independence " separatist movement is the very cause that poisons the current situation of the cross - strait relations and endang@@ ers the peace in the strait .
the taiwan authority deliberately mis@@ interpre@@ ts the mainland 's efforts in opposing " taiwan independence " and maintaining peace in the strait to be oppression against democracy and freedom in taiwan and uses it as an excuse to carry out a referendum .
aimed at soliciting sympathy and support for its separatist line through deception , it is purely fabricated and conf@@ uses right from wrong .
while the taiwan authority leader claimed the referendum to be held to be of a defensive and peaceful nature , the provoking act , however disguised , can only trigger off opposition and hostility across the straits , exacerb@@ ate the tensions in the cross - strait relations , and gradually bring the cross - strait relations to the brink of vital danger .
it runs counter to the mainstream public hope in taiwan to seek peace , stability and development . it is not the deepening of taiwan " democracy , " but is misleading and maneu@@ vering the taiwan people , constitutes a grave threat to the peace and stability in asia pacific , and is doomed to be opposed by the chinese compatriots across the strait and the international community at large .
in retro@@ spect , unification has always been the mainstream along the historical development of the chinese nation , has always represented the general course of development , and has been welcomed by the people .
with the motherland growing stronger and stronger and cross - strait cooperation continued to develop , the one china landscape will be even more firmly established , and any separatist attempt is doomed to fail .
over two weeks from now comes the lunar new year , a traditional festival of great importance to the chinese people .
on the bustling and happy day , we usually gather together with relatives and friends to exchange gifts and express good will .
the hong kong postal service , under the spirit of " sending regards and passing business opportunities , " cooper@@ ates with china postal service to launch " china - hong kong gift express delivery service , " sending the best regards of hong kong citizens to their relatives , friends , and customers in hong kong or the mainland .
hong kong postal service has worked together with other postal services over time to provide international cargo delivery service .
it cooperated with australian postal service in december 2002 to launch western alcohol delivery service , providing high quality products to hong kong citizens .
this time we cooperate with china postal service to establish close collaboration in postal service , mail remittance , express delivery , and even in the field of trans - border cargo delivery . we have launched " china - hong kong gift express delivery service " based on the rising market demand by hong kong citizens for sending gifts to mainland relatives , friends , and customers .
the first grouping of gifts is various kinds of gift boxes beautifully packed , containing in - season swe@@ ets , tea , and seafood , with a variety of different price t@@ ags to choose from .
the gifts look very nice , ideal for mainland relatives and friends and business partners alike .
the consumers committee has done conspicuous work in protecting consumers ' rights over 30 years .
the best way to evaluate the achievements of the committee is to see whether consumers ' rights have been effectively protected .
i totally agree with chairman chen . over 30 years , consumers have understood clearly their rights , and society has attached importance to consumers ' rights . this is the achievement made by the hard work of the committee and the administration .
the consumers committee tests products regularly , conducts investigation into different products and services , study industry operations , and communicate fair and objective market information to the public through the monthly selection .
the monthly selection enjoys confidence of the citizens . now the monthly also runs an online edition , playing a better role in helping consumers collect market information faster and more conveniently .
the consumers committee has 11 regional consumer consultancy centers and 16 telephone hotlines , providing products and services information to the consumers and receiving consumers ' complaints .
since its establishment , the consumers committee has received more and more queries , from thousands of queries in the early 1970s to 14@@ 6,000 last year , an increase of over 20 times , a clear indication that more and more consumers are referring to the reports and opinions of the committee before they choose from products and services .
furthermore , the consumers committee has handled over 26@@ ,000 complaints .
the consumers committee has named a few shops that adopt a deceptive way of operation . this not only prevents consumers from being cheated , but also serves as a deterrent to the operators .
legislator yang , i told you i watched tv seriously on july 1 . seeing the citizens appealing and angry about the administration , i have then thought about it many times .
the administration and i have been working hard to improve in this regard in the past six to seven months . understanding the citizens require us to make a good job of economy and the people 's livelihood , we have done a lot of work in this regard . we understand the citizens hold different opinions on the 23rd item of the basic law ; therefore we have withdrawn it , indeed a timely response made by the administration .
i also clearly understand the citizens ' appeal for democracy .
however , legislator yang , i want to tell you what i am doing today is to ensure everything will run smoothly after the review of political system begins . therefore some basic issues shall be sorted out . these are two different matter .
what are the basic issues ?
some are related to principles , some to the law , concerning items about review of political system in the basic law . it is the priority to understand it .
we are doing this part of work right now . a three - member team has begun the work .
the team will consult with the central government and will listen to the public opinion in hong kong . i think it to be a very good step . it is a decision we make indicating our seriousness about the public opinion in hong kong .
in today 's highly competitive business environment , the brand plays a key role in the success of a product .
the establishment of a brand is not work done overnight . it requires innovative design , high quality , compelling packaging , effective operation , and sustained investment .
hong kong boasts favorable conditions to establish renowned brands .
we have necessary know - how , skills , and experiences . we boast many talents from design to manufacturing to marketing to management . we also enjoy extensive markets .
the newly adopted cep@@ a will enhance our advantages . apart from zero tariffs for our exports to the mainland market , cep@@ a 's biggest benefit is to encourage businessmen to find new methods to increase their products ' added values , in an effort to build prestigious brands admired by hong kong , mainland , and global consumers .
china manufacturers association initiated the top 10 hong kong brands selection , which happened to coincide with cep@@ a 's efforts to boost added values of hong kong products .
in the past five years , the selection has brought about 51 top hong kong brands .
however , 51 is not a big number consider a market as large as the mainland , which requires hundreds and thousands more of famous hong kong brands .
the hong kong subway have been actively participated in the subway projects in major mainland cities over the past years , providing their rich experiences to the mainland market through services .
i am pleased that the quality of the investment , professional service and management talents has been recognized by the mainland market .
such exchange between shenzhen and hong kong is not only conducive to the development of the motherland , but also create more opportunities for hong kong business . apart from promoting economic development , it will also create more employment opportunities for hong kong .
i would like to extend my deep gratitude to the central government and the shenzhen special economic zone government for their policy support so that we could reach an agreement on the project in principle .
it is the first time for the subway company to venture out of hong kong and participate in the subway development in the mainland through investment . it will promote hong kong brands in the mainland and are welcomed by hong kong people and mainland compatriots alike .
i hereby would like to wish smooth work for the shenzhen city transport route no . 4 , so that it will be approved by the central government at the earliest time possible and lay down a firm foundation for the future cooperation between shenzhen and hong kong .
today is the fifth day in the lunar new year . i am pleased to be invited by the gold and silver exchange to attend your new year celebration party and preside over the opening ceremony for the new year 's gold market .
first i would like to wish you a happy new year in the year of the monkey to enjoy enterprising spirits , good luck , and great fortune and have every dream fulfilled .
the gold price has risen significantly over the past year , surpassing us $ 400 per ounce . with the strong momentum continued , it is a clear indication that investors have recovered their confidence in gold .
i believe the colleagues have been very busy with work in the past year .
in fact , the prosperous market , apart from resulting in from external factors , is also the fruit of over 90 years of hard work by the gold and silver exchange .
the hard work has laid down a good foundation for the hong kong gold market , and had contributed a lot to the strengthening of hong kong 's position as an international financial center .
as we say " the whole year 's work depends on a good start in spring , " i hope the colleagues in the gold and silver exchange will continue to work hard in the new year to seize the golden opportunity ushered in by the mainland gold market reform , china 's entry to the w@@ to , and the increased demand for gold driven by cep@@ a , in an effort to ensure the continued growth of the market .
i believe through our active work hong kong 's gold market will achieve great success in the new year .
finally , i wish a busy and prosperous new year of the monkey for the gold market .
thank you very much .
however , the past challenges were not limited to fund public housing , and the private housing was also a big challenge .
the assets bubble burst in the 1997 financial crisis , leading to real estate prices falling 70 % and hurting the owners badly . this was the main cause to the continually increasing deflation in the past five years .
now the economy has made a good turn and we are determined to maintain a stable environment and ensure the steady and sustained development of real estate market .
a healthy real estate market is key to the continued recovery of hong kong 's economy .
we also try to protect and improve the living environment .
our future work will be based on the principle of sustainable development . we will adopt more suitable city planning , strengthen the protection of natural and historical her@@ it@@ ages , and improving the living environment .
we will pay double attention to the overall environmental problem .
the outbreak of s@@ ars last year in hong kong is a reminder for us to try the best to build a clean and healthy living environment .
we will work hard to improve the environment , plant more trees , and build more parks and health facilities for the convenience of the citizens .
i hereby would like to extend my gratitude to the many legislators for their comments on the sections about judicial administration , the law , the political system , the public service , personnel in the financing bodies , and security in the chief executive 's report .
legislators who commented on judicial administration and legal service are wu ai and zeng yu , chair and vice chair of the judicial administration and legal affairs committee on the legislature .
the chief executive put forward many measures in his report to promote administration devoted to the people , including strengthening relations between important officials and society , conducting more public policy research , deepening cooperation between the administration and the legislature , and faithfully reviewing the political system .
the legal and policy department fully participates in the above - mentioned work , and is committed to ensure all the administration measures are in line with the law and procedures , especially in line with the basic law , including the citizens ' basic rights and freedom safeguarded by it . the department will keep its vigilance as required by legislator wu ai , in order to maintain hong kong 's rule of law and independence of jurisdiction .
as a key official , i shall try my best to understand the opinions of the public and the legal circles on issues that affect judicial administration and the legal profession .
for example , the arrangement for closer economic and trade ties between the mainland and hong kong is the fruit of close cooperation between the administration and the professional circles , including the grand law society , the bar association , the chinese no@@ tar@@ ization for authorization association , etc.
we have successfully included " legal service " in the arrangement and legal service is one of the service sectors that are open to us in the mainland . it provides new space for the two sides ' legal service cooperation and bring about macro and long - term benefits to the two sides ' legal service sectors .
the work of the special task force is bi - directional . we will report to the central government what we have heard about hong kong 's public opinion .
we have received more than ten groups and personages from january to now .
everybody totally accepts " one country , two systems " to be a must for hong kong 's political development and the fact that the hk@@ sar is directly under the leadership of the central government .
most of them believe the political system in hong kong needs improvement ; at the same time , they recognize that any development shall be in line with the basic law .
the groups and personages have their individual ideas about some procedure and legal issues .
the special task force will forward their wills , ideas , and position papers to the central government in a complete form .
the special task force will continue to receive other groups and personages in the next month and we will forward the received opinions to the central government in succession .
this is only the first time that the special task force meets with the related department in the central government . we need to continue to exchange our work with the central government .
i understand that everybody is clear about the fact that the development of the political system involves the relationship between the central government and the sar and that the central government has rights and responsibility to review the development of the political system in the sar . we need to conduct full discussion with the central government .
the west k@@ ow@@ loon culture and entertainment district is an unprecedented cultural and arts initiative in hong kong . it is not only an initiative to provide the citizens with a cultural and entertainment space , but it also serves to cultivate the character of the citizens and improve the urban environment .
the west k@@ ow@@ loon culture and entertainment district belongs to the whole hong kong society .
the administration must continue to conduct in - depth discussion with all walks of life and pool the wisdom of the masses .
we understand there is more to beautiful buildings involved . we need to make it bring about economic benefits , capable of sustainable development and beneficial to the living quality of the citizens .
therefore , the administration attaches great importance to the complementary software of the west k@@ ow@@ loon culture and entertainment district . it must coordinate with related measures , including facilities management , entertainment program promotion , show and exhibition contents and publicity , etc.
the making of related policies shall absorb the ideas of the " end users . "
the young generation , including every young friend present , is one of the most end user groups of the future west k@@ ow@@ loon culture and entertainment district .
we hope that the district will be good for both the old and the young , will suit both refined and popular tastes , and will be liked by both hong kong citizens and outside guests , by both the grown adults and the lively youngsters .
i understand you discussed the several issues in relation to the west k@@ ow@@ loon culture and entertainment district this morning . some students have devoted much work to finish a special report over the past month . i believe you have understood well the details of the initiative .
i am eager to hear the results of your discussion and hope to exchange views with you .
since the 9/11 terrorist attack , the world has paid special attention to the security in se@@ ap@@ orts and airports and along borders .
as the biggest port with the most cargo container going to the united states , hong kong undoubtedly made a swift response to the port security initiative proposed by the united states .
furthermore , we believe to cut off the lifeline of terrorist organizations is an effective way to combat terrorism .
the huge amount of funds flowing in the global financial system benefiting crimes has always been a headache for anti - money laundering law enforcement agencies .
as the major financial center in asia , hong kong believes to cut off the funds supply to the terrorists may well be the most effective way to attack their organization .
now hong kong 's legislature is discussing the amendment proposals to tighten existing legislation to prevent funding terrorist activities and actively coordinate with international standards and current situation . a good example is the new proposal made by the anti - money laundering special task force to amend legislation .
furthermore , we are now trying to make better information disclosure legislation to help agencies and people concerned to report suspicious transactions .
the " balance " is the key to the work : effective investigation authority , freedom safeguarded by the law , privacy , and economic and financial efficiency are all factors to be considered .
our regulation measures are based on the rule of law , transparency , justice , and efficiency .
in fact , the service sector of hong kong enjoys advantages in many aspects .
professional and business service talents of hong kong have an in - depth understanding of both the global and mainland business operations .
hong kong 's professional services in the field of accounting , finance , law , and arbitration are the best partners to be found by mainland enterprises as they move to compete in the international market .
our services in the field of transportation , construction , design and marketing , management consultancy , information technology , and conferencing and exhibition will boost the overall productivity and competitiveness of mainland enterprises and help them develop market expansion plans and promote their brands .
the services in the fields of tourism , health , and insurance will help promote the development of corresponding markets and sectors in the mainland and improve the level of services .
the close cooperation between the two sides ' service sectors will significantly improve their original advantages and help boost their capabilities to handle the opportunities and challenges presented by economic globalization .
in order to promote the development of professional services in the mainland , the finance secretary and i , together with officials from policy and enforcement agencies concerned and representatives from the professional circles , talked with our mainland counterparts in beijing last week about the verification of professional qualification and other issue of interest to the service sector . the discussions were concrete and valuable .
we are glad to have signed cooperation agreements to mutually recognize professional qualification in the areas of construction , structural engineering , and insurance , taking an important step forward for the service sector 's development in the mainland market .
through this meeting , the professional organizations of hong kong established closer relations with mainland policy and regulation agencies , laying down a good foundation for the next phase of friendly cooperation .
i believe the majority of hong kong citizens love the motherland and love hong kong .
the economic , social , political , and cultural relations and links between the mainland and hong kong have always been very close before and after hong kong 's return to the motherland .
in the economic field , we see that since the four modern@@ izations drive and reform and opening - up started in the motherland more than twenty years ago , the industry of hong kong has enjoyed opportunities to transfer to the north and find new space for development . this has strengthened the relations between hong kong and the mainland .
we are glad to have reached an agreement with the central government for closer economic cooperation arrangement , so that the service sector of hong kong would win new opportunities to participate in the economic development in the mainland in a more active and extensive way and contribute to the motherland and hong kong . this is bound to strengthen the ties between hong kong and the mainland .
in the field of social development , we see that the motherland has enjoyed dramatic development in recent years .
hong kong citizens were extremely happy to see beijing 's successful bid for the 2008 oly@@ mp@@ ics .
hong kong citizens were also extremely happy to receive yang li@@ wei several months ago . why ?
because we feel that everyone , every hong kong citizen is proud of the achievements of the motherland .
i understand that the law - making committee began to discuss its permanent office location with the administration as early as ten years ago .
similarly , the administration has been considering the long - term plan for the relocation of its office over the past ten - odd years .
therefore , i understand the administration 's decision to postpone some projects , including the tian@@ maj@@ ian development project for the new law - making committee office building , must have disappointed some law makers .
i understand the law makers have to endure hardships as they continue to work in a not good enough environment during this period .
however , just as what i say to the administration colleagues affected by the decision , i hope that , with the public interests to be in the first place , you could understand the situation and endure the hardships during this period .
i have earlier explained many times to the administration committee of the legislature that given the current financial situation and the financial conditions after the outbreak of s@@ ars last year , the administration does not think it to be the right time to undertake the tian@@ maj@@ ian project or other large - scale office building project .
the postponement of the legislature 's new office building project in tian@@ maj@@ ian would help alleviate the financial pressures on the administration in the next few years and would be in the interests of the public and therefore would be welcomed by the public .
as the public financial situation improves , the administration will resume the new legislature office building project . that is our current plan .
the motherland cares much about hong kong . the president and the premier are much concerned about hong kong . i understand they and the central government will try the best to do a good job in this regard .
therefore , good news are forthcoming in various areas , such as tourism , finance , coordination of infrastructure construction , navigation rights , zero tariffs for products , and services .
i also hope to see hong kong makes better use of its advantages to contribute more to the national development as the hong kong economy rec@@ overs .
when i met with premier wen ji@@ abao , i congratulated him on behalf of hong kong on the great achievements the motherland made in the past year under his leadership in very difficult conditions . though the future is full of challenges - you all heard his work report - he is full of confidence . we are much encouraged .
premier wen said to me that reviewing the important point of " one country , two systems " raised by m@@ r. deng xia@@ oping twenty years ago is very helpful for us to fully understand the guideline and contributes to the development of future policies .
he told me that hong kong people indeed need to grasp the opportunity to focus on economic development and welfare improvement . he is full of confidence in hong kong .
later on i went to meet with m@@ r. zhang de@@ jiang , party chief of guangdong province , and m@@ r. huang hua@@ hua , guangdong governor . i discussed with them about how to further improve our cooperation on the current basis and create a better win - win situation .
the final point is the familiar " administration of hong kong by hong kong people , " a system that guarantees the administration of hong kong by hong kong people and their majority shall be patriots .
there are clear standards about the patri@@ ot . the patri@@ ot respects his nation , tru@@ thfully supports the country 's resuming sovereignty in hong kong , and never does anything harmful to hong kong or the motherland . the administration of hong kong shall be done by hong kong people with a majority of patriots .
i need to reiterate that the general citizen@@ ry of hong kong love the motherland .
those i mention here does not refer to the average hong kong citizen , but the personages who take part in the administration of public affairs in hong kong , those of higher level who serve in the administration , legislature , and judicial body .
when they are sworn into office , as provisi@@ oned by the basic law , they need to express their support for the hk@@ sar basic law of the people 's republic of china and swear their allegiance to the hk@@ sar of the pr@@ c .
the above - mentioned fifth and sixth principles and the important considerations , in fact , have been specified in the 1980s when the discussion about hong kong 's long term future began and the making of the joint declaration and the basic law were under way , and they will never change , because they constitute a series of long - term policies in relation to the motherland 's resuming sovereignty over hong kong . they are the national policy and will never change .
the system of intellectual property , since its n@@ aissance , especially since the industrial revolution , has helped bring about one after one epoch - making inventions .
over the past twenty years , the system of intellectual property has become a basic legal system and important policy measure for the countries to promote technological innovation and has played an important role in reviving economy and enhancing international competitiveness .
with the rapid development of science and technology and the drive to economic globalization now , the creation , occupation and utilization of knowledge and intellectual resources and the quantity and quality of intellectual properties owned have become an important basis for the countries to participate in international competition .
therefore , strengthening international exchange and cooperation in intellectual property protection holds great importance to the establishment of a fair and justified new international economic order and to the development and prosperity of the global economy .
the chinese government attaches great importance to intellectual property protection .
china began to establish its intellectual property protection system at the beginning of reform and opening - up . through more than twenty years ' hard work , china has established a relatively complete intellectual property protection legal system , with a intellectual property protection system in place combining both judicial administration and administrative enforcement of law . china has done a lot of work in intellectual property protection , contributing significantly to the advancement of science and technology and to economic and social development .
the human race enters the information society in the 21st century when the science and technology revolution is bound to promote the development of productivity with unprecedented strength .
further improving our country 's intellectual property protection system and strengthening international exchange and cooperation in intellectual property protection is an requirement of the development of opening - up in the new century and a must to build up a socialist modernized country and achieve the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation .
we are ready to work with other countries in the world towards establishing a fair and justified intellectual property system conducive to promoting science and technology advancement and economic development , and towards creating a good environment where the entire human race respects knowledge , science , and intellectual property protection .
to speed up the building up of the mechanism is the priority task of the shanghai cooperation organization .
the preparation work for the establishment of the secretariat and regional anti - terrorism unit has made significant progress under all parties ' hard work .
we shall continue to work hard to ensure the secretariat will begin to function by the end of this year and establish the regional anti - terrorism unit at the earliest time possible .
to demonstrate the great importance attached to shanghai cooperation organization , the chinese government decided to provide free premises to the secretariat as china is the host country .
in the future , we will continue to provide support vigorous support for the smooth operation of the secretariat .
deepening and expanding security cooperation has always been the priority of shanghai cooperation organization .
we shall never relax vigilance against the " three forces " that severely threaten the member countries ' interests in the region and appe@@ as@@ ement is never an option .
we shall work devote our long - term unremitting efforts to the eradication of the evil forces and effectively maintaining stability in the region .
in order to cut off financial supplies to the " three forces " and crack down on the " three forces " in a more extensive and effective way , we shall include anti - narcotic work in the security cooperation agenda as soon as possible .
economic cooperation is an important basis and priority task of shanghai cooperation organization .
education is the foundation stone of modern civilization .
to help the cultivation of character of the citizens and increase the overall national strength requires hard work to develop education .
education in rural areas has an extensive impact , important for the overall situation of economic and social development in rural areas .
since the reform and opening - up , the urban and rural areas of the country have seen dramatic and profound changes . this is closely related to education , especially education in rural areas .
the household contract responsibility system in rural areas has liberated rural productivity .
a basic reason why advanced effective technology can be extensively applied , why village and township enterprises can suddenly rise to the fore , and why surplus rural labor force can move to coastal and urban areas on a massive scale is that the rural labor force , number at hundreds of thousands , have received compulsory education . the compulsory education in rural areas has made great , indeli@@ ble achievements .
now the country 's agriculture and rural economy is in a key developmental stage . the development of high quality , high efficiency , environmentally friendly , and safe agriculture , the expansion of agricultural industry , and the transfer of surplus rural labor force all urgently require the cultivation of the rural labor force quality .
the rise of global science and technology revolution and the drive to build up a fully affluent society put even higher requirements on the cultivation of scientific knowledge and ethical character on the part of the rural population .
without the overall implementation of nine - year compulsory education in rural areas , without the overall cultivation of character of the rural population , it is impossible to realize a fully affluent society .
we must fully understand that rural education holds fundamental importance , first priority , and overall significance in the building up of a fully affluent society .
consultants and guests present at the meeting include senior officials from prestigious transnational companies , internationally renowned economists , and learned experts and academics .
it is my deep feeling that the consultants work under a spirit of sincere cooperation and with a positive attitude of pragm@@ atism .
fully leveraging our cooperation spirit and collective wisdom is conducive to not only planning and promoting the development of guangdong , but to enhancing our cooperation in various fields .
i have long awaited the advent of the 2003 guangdong international economic development conference to understand your penetrating views on the economic and social development of guangdong .
we gladly convene here today for a common goal : to strengthen cooperation and exchange , to promote development , both for the added vitality of the economic and social development in guangdong , and for the new opportunities in your business growth .
china 's entry to the w@@ to ush@@ ers in a new phase of china 's opening - up . we are participating international competition in a broader scope , in more extensive areas , and at a higher level .
guangdong boasts the most outward - oriented economy among all the provinces in the chinese mainland . it is the first to see the unprecedented opportunities of development and serious challenges alike .
against such a general backdrop , we have to grasp new opportunities , face up to new challenges , enhance our all - round international competitiveness , actively promote the modernization drive , work hard for better economic cooperation , and achieve mutual complement@@ arity , mutual benefit , long - term cooperation , and common development .
the people of guangdong are focusing on the building up of a fully affluent society and speeding up the modernization drive . this will create more opportunities of development and expansion for our friends .
the economy of guangdong , full of vitality and showing promising prospects , is leap@@ ing forward to a higher level .
the ira@@ qi provisional administration committee and the us occupation authority signed an agreement in bag@@ hdad recently , announcing a step - by - step timetable to transfer power back to iraq by next june .
the agreement was reluctantly accepted by the international community : though eu foreign ministers ' meeting welcomed it , france believed the process to be " too slow ; " un secretary - general k@@ ofi ann@@ an , while felt encouraged by the transfer of power plan , said the time is not ripe for un to play its role in iraq ; and russia simply questioned the legitimacy of the agreement .
the ira@@ qi people gave a cold response ; the us media even thought " it is a big gam@@ bel . "
in a word , people were mainly uncertain and held a wait - and - see attitude .
the international community 's many concerns are with good reason .
for we see transfer of power back to iraq is not an action the united states is most willing to take , and therefore the transfer will not be complete and potential problems will be left over .
first , the provisional government to be formed in next may will not be directly elected by the ira@@ qi people , but rather by the provisional national representatives congress elected by the 18 provincial election committees .
it cannot but arouse suspicion of us control and its legitimacy may well be questioned .
second , the us armed forces will not withdraw , but merely change from " military occupation " to " military presence . "
the us government declared on november 18 to impose quotas on three textile products imported from china , namely , k@@ itted fabric , cor@@ sel@@ ets , and g@@ owns .
just as china continues to work towards improving sino - us economic and trade cooperation , it is simply a shame for the us government to take such a protection@@ ist measure .
given the current level of economic globalization , the renewed quota imposed by the united states on chinese textile imports is completely un@@ timely .
first , abuse of " quotas " compromises the implementation of w@@ to free trade principles .
talking big about " free trade " on the one hand and frequently using " quotas " as ste@@ alth attacks is nothing but arbitrary and unfair .
second , " quotas " hurt the good momentum of sino - us economic and trade .
since china and the united states reached an agreement on china 's entry to the w@@ to , us exports to china have increased 15 % on an annual basis .
from january to september , us exports to china increased 2@@ 6.2 % over the same period last year .
over the past two years , us textile raw material and finished products exports to china have grown significantly .
in fact , now us exports grow fastest in china .
many reasons contributed to the failure by bush to achieve his goals during his visit to britain , and the most important one was the swelling us unilater@@ alism since the end of the cold war with the united states emerging as the sole super power that holds all others in scor@@ n .
the united states launched the war against iraq without un authorization and showed no respect to its main allies in important international affairs such as the rebuilding of iraq , thus ex@@ as@@ per@@ ating the general wr@@ ath by stubbornly sticking to its own way .
a public opinion poll released by the european union committee lately indicates 68 % eu citizens believe the us war against iraq without enough justifications and 53 % believe that the united states is a threat to world peace .
second , the united states demands its allies to supply personnel and fund for its emphasis on anti - terrorism work while cares nothing about the allies ' concerns .
the united states retained firm control of projects of rebuilding iraq and gave major contracts mainly to american companies in the first request for proposal , not willing to share with others . the w@@ to ruled against high us tariffs in the steel trade dispute and the british industrial and business community hoped for american concession during bush 's visit , but there was no clear commitment .
third , the united states takes its own value as the highest principle putting it above other countries . it insisted on democratic reform in middle east countries and was re@@ pro@@ ached . some allies requested the united states to respect the culture and unique characteristics of the is@@ lam nations , believing one of the reasons the us military has sunk in the ira@@ qi qu@@ agm@@ ire is exactly the dis@@ respect .
however , bush will not change because of extensive criticism and opposition . he defended again for his ira@@ qi policy and emphasized that the us - british allied forces will continue to use force to handle the violence in iraq .
now that bush failed to realize his hope during the visit to britain , the situation in iraq may well not develop along the thinking of the white house .
the advance contingent of the japanese self defense force was finally dispatched to iraq after half a year 's deb@@ at .
it is the first time that japan has sent troops to overseas battle@@ ground since the end of ww@@ ii .
it reflects japan 's will to become a political and military power and also signals a change in japan 's defense strategy .
the dispatch of the self defense force is noticeable in that it is not an isolated event .
japan made the breakthrough in sending troops overseas utilizing the opportunity of af@@ gh@@ anistan ; passed contingency legislation utilizing the opportunity of the korean peninsula issue , fore@@ shad@@ owing the possibility of the use of force and pre@@ emptive measures by thes@@ elf defense force ; furthermore , the ko@@ izumi cabinet passed the basic plan to support rebuilding iraq lately , laying down the foundation for sending troops to iraq .
step by step , japan finally made the breakthrough against the limitation of the peaceful constitution and was successful in sending troops to overseas battle@@ ground .
furthermore , japan is prepared to amend the basic defense force concept to make sending troops overseas legal and permanent , and plans to establish a non - temporary " permanent unit " for overseas dispatch .
meanwhile , the japanese cabinet meeting , in the excuse of " north korean missile threat , " made the decision to begin to deploy the missile defense system in early 2004 , introducing us - made standard@@ -3 and patri@@ ot@@ -3 missiles to intercept out - atmosphere missiles and missiles returning to atmosphere respectively , in an effort to build up a dual - layer missile interception network .
it is not difficult to see that the japanese self defense force is becoming a regular army capable of both defense and attack , and that the " only for defense " self defense force looks likely to exist only in name .
the reason why japan 's action comes to the front , first , is that the military decisions constitute an assault against japan 's peaceful constitution .
ko@@ izumi was interviewed by japanese reporters after his visit to the ya@@ su@@ kuni shrine defending his action .
his defense was self - contradictory and full of in@@ consist@@ encies .
when asked by reporters why he visited the ya@@ su@@ kuni shrine , ko@@ izumi said " japan 's peace and prosperity is built on the sacrifice of the war dead . "
" i paid tribute to the shrine to pray peace and prosperity for japan . "
a good question is whether the " war dead " mentioned by ko@@ izumi includes a - class war criminals like to@@ jo ?
is it to say that japan 's peace and prosperity is also built on the sacrifice of the war criminals ?
a reporter asked why he chose to visit the ya@@ su@@ kuni shrine on jan 1 .
ko@@ izumi said that it is the japanese tradition to pay tribute to the shrine with many people visiting shr@@ ines on the day .
it is understandable that the average people pay tribute to relatives and friends . furthermore , many survivors clearly say that they visit the shrine only to pay tribute to their relatives and friends , and they are firmly opposed to including a - class war criminals in the ya@@ su@@ kuni shrine .
the chinese people listen to reason . we have always insisted on distinguishing the japanese people from the minority of militants , and distinguishing the general public from the right - wing activists . the average people 's visit to the ya@@ su@@ kuni shrine is not the crux of the historical problem .
unity is where strength comes from .
this is an indisputable truth .
to realize the grand goal of fully building up an affluent society and achieve the lofty cause of the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation , all forces that can be united must be united .
this is the basic starting point and very foundation for the work of the patriotic united front and the chinese people 's political consultative conference in the new century and new era .
we shall hold on to and improve the multi - party cooperation and political consol@@ ation system under the leadership of the communist party of china , continue to build up and develop the patriotic united front , and mobilize all positive aspects in the most extensive and fullest possible way , in a continued effort to bring new strengths into the cause of the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation .
over the past year , the cppcc has held on the two themes of unity and democracy , faithfully carried out its functions , and played an important role in promoting all - round economic and social development and safeguarding the overall situation of reform , opening - up , and stability .
in the new year , it is hoped that the cppcc will focus on the central tasks of the party and the nation , further its efforts in political consultation , democratic monitoring , and participation in and discussion of government and political affairs , carry forward its good tradition , leverage its advantages , deepen its research and investigation , and actively put forward good ideas , in a bid to contribute more to the building up of a fully affluent society .
the 12th sa@@ ar@@ c summit was held in isl@@ am@@ abad during jan 4 - 6 after a whole year 's postponement . the summit passed documents such as south asian free trade framework agreement , additional protocol to sa@@ ar@@ c anti - terrorism convention , and south asian social charter , and declared that sa@@ ar@@ c members shall work together to bring about common development and cooperation in economic , cultural , and anti - terrorism areas .
during the sa@@ ar@@ c summit , the bilateral meeting between indian prime minister v@@ aj@@ payee and pak@@ istani president mus@@ har@@ raf was especially interesting .
v@@ aj@@ payee and mus@@ har@@ raf 's hand@@ shake at the last summit did not raise too much hope for the prospects of bilateral relations .
two years later , as the two countries took significant measures to resume normal diplomatic relations and land and air communications and carry out ceasefire in kash@@ mir , the indian - pak@@ istani relations continued to move towards better and finally achieved the highest level bilateral meeting thanks to the opportunity presented by the sa@@ ar@@ c summit .
the two countries moved a big step forward in improving bilateral relations , ush@@ ering in a good turning point to promote south asian regional cooperation .
though indian foreign minister sing@@ h said on jan 4 that the meeting is only " courtesy " in nature , it is believed that the indian - pak@@ istani relations will continue to readjust in the more positive and pragmatic direction .
the two countries leaders both realized that tension and confront are not conducive to national interests and can only lead to losing again and again opportunities for economic development .
as the economic globalization drive intensi@@ fies , strengthening cooperation and reviving economy have become the most urgent tasks of both governments .
though a formal announcement of result was yet to be made following ge@@ or@@ gia 's presidential election held on jan 4 , sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i , candidate from the union of rightwing parties and leader of the national movement party , was certain to win .
the central election committee declared on jan 7 that over 95 % voters support sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i according to the counting of 89 % votes .
some heads of state of cis sent congratul@@ ation tele@@ graph@@ s to the young states@@ ma .
actually , sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i had declared his victory by the night when the election was ended .
he said that the result is the " victory of the people " and that ge@@ or@@ gia will take prompt action to usher in a new future .
many voters said when interviewed by the media that voting for sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i means the choice of a " new hope . "
even former president sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ nad@@ ze who had resigned under pressure expressed his support to his former political opponent , praising that he is " young , energetic , and well - educated . "
it is noted that while big hope is granted to sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i , no major changes have happened during the past tow month since sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ nad@@ ze 's resignation .
it can be said that the newly - elected president will still face the old problems .
the past year marks an important and unusual one in the process of our country 's development .
we fought extremely hard against the sudden attack of s@@ ars and won a periodical victory ; the national economy maintained good momentum of development with g@@ d@@ p per capita stepping up to over us $ 1,000 ; the shen@@ zhou v manned spacecraft was a full success , bringing the chinese nation 's space dream into reality ; we also achieved national unity , social development , and continued improvement of the living standards .
our country 's achievements in various fields win admiration of the world . the people worked hard for the success , demonstrating val@@ or and strength to face up to difficulties and create miracles .
looking forward to the new year , we are full of confidence and hope .
in view of the overall domestic and international situation , our country is in an important strategic period of opportunities , which shall be leveraged to bring bright prospects .
we shall adhere to the guidance of deng xia@@ oping theory and the important theory of " three represents , " fully carry out the spirit of the 16th national party congress and the third plenary session of the 16th party central committee , du@@ ti@@ fully fulfill the general policies and decisions of the party central leadership in relation to the tasks this year , and continue to push forward the reform , opening - up , and modernization drive .
to do a good job of this year 's tasks , we must understand well the situation , recognizing both favorable conditions plus news opportunities and unfavorable conditions plus new challenges , and build up our sense of responsibility , urgency , and hardship .
the three - party talks on the ira@@ qi issue was held in the un headquarters in new york on jan 19 , during which un secretary - general k@@ ofi ann@@ an discussed with iraq provisional authority and us - british allied forces provision authority with key focuses on the un 's role in rebuilding iraq .
the discussion involved factors such as political , humanitarian , and security situations in iraq and the appointment of us special envoy to iraq . the three parties exchanged their views frankly on these issues .
it is naturally a focal point of public attention to see whether and how the united nations is going to be involved in the rebuilding of iraq as the united states and britain 's transfer of power plan is facing resistance .
since the united states declared the end of major warfare in iraq early last may , the situation in iraq has remained in turmoil , with attacks against the occupation breaking out now and then , leading to mounting casualties of the us - british allied forces and virtually no peace at all .
the us happiness following former ira@@ qi president s@@ addam 's capture on december 13 last year is short - lived as there has been no sign indicating the security situation is moving towards better and the occupation authority is sinking into a qu@@ agm@@ ire with the resistance intensified .
on the other hand , the ira@@ qi people and arab nations unanimously demand the withdrawal of foreign forces and the return of authority to iraq to allow the ira@@ qi people to govern their own nation .
meanwhile , the united states and britain seek to rebuild the ira@@ qi government according to their own will and on such basis break away gradually from the qu@@ agm@@ ire in a " dignified " manner .
in this connection , how to conduct the transfer of power and its process have become the key to the present ira@@ qi issue .
according to the transfer of power plan put forward by the us - british administration authority and iraq provisional authority in last november , the " provisional national representative congress " will elect members on ira@@ qi provisional government to be formed by july 1 , while the representatives to the congress shall be appointed by the provincial electoral committees .
on the other hand , the shi@@ ite faction , which occupies the majority in the ira@@ qi population , emphasizes that direct election is a must to truly fairly transfer power back to iraq .
us state secretary pow@@ ell 's recent visit to russia remains to be a focal point of public attention .
one reason is that the us - russian relations hold great importance to the world .
more importantly , pow@@ ell 's visit to moscow was rich in concrete contents and sent a clear message that there were clouds over the us - russian relations .
without timely dispers@@ ing the clouds , the prospects for the bilateral relationship look dim .
though the dialog channel remained clear between washington and moscow , pow@@ ell made the decision to publish an article in russia 's influential message newspaper to explain his position .
the united states feels confused by the series of events in russia 's internal politics and diplomacy in the past several months , pow@@ ell said in the article .
he believed that the russian regime does not completely recognize the rule of law and that key factors of a civil society such as press freedom and development of political parties are not firm and strong enough .
the united states is especially worried by russia 's policy in ch@@ echnya and its attitude towards neighboring countries in the cis .
in the opinion of diplomats , making a public announcement through the mass media is the " last resort " to communications .
the intention to make such a choice by the united states is worth considering . it is clear that the russian side feels embarrassed and unhappy .
with the advent of the new century , economic globalization has become a key and serious challenge faced by african countries .
african leaders see more and more clearly that africa can no longer lose good opportunities and have to work hard to find a way out of difficulty .
the african union was established and began to work on july 9, 2002 . ever since , african countries have worked hard to develop their economies by actively carrying out the " new partners for african development plan " in a hope to find a way out of the disadvantaged situation in the economic globalization drive on the one hand , and on the other hand have tried hard to resolve armed conflict , the major obstacle to african rejuvenation , in an effort to create a unified , peaceful and stable environment .
now the overall situation in africa has move forward towards further easing up with hot spots clearly cooling down and all countries feeling the urgency to end armed conflict .
under the great support of the united nations and the international community , influential african regional group@@ ings , regional powers , and prestigious statesmen have all stepped up their active work towards the resolution of regional conflicts and internal turmoil , with some conflicts and turbul@@ ences that have lasted several years basically put under control .
for example , z@@ aire established the national united government last june ; s@@ ao t@@ ome and princi@@ pe resolved its coup d '@@ et@@ at crisis through peaceful means in july ; the liber@@ ian government and anti - government forces signed a peace agreement in acc@@ ra , capital city of gh@@ ana , in august ; the sud@@ anese government and southern anti - government forces began talks in september , a key to resolve the peace process deadlock ; the armed forces and political groups of somalia began peace talks in ken@@ ya in october to discuss national peace process ; and the bur@@ undi government and anti - government forces signed their peace agreement in november .
of course , the stability of africa is still vulnerable at present , with the results of the peace processes to be consolidated and some potential and ongoing armed conflicts to be finally resolved .
meanwhile , african economies still develop much more slowly than the asian developing countries . all these are unfavorable to the development of africa .
to face up to the challenge presented by economic globalization and realize the dream of african rejuvenation demands long - term hard work by the african people .
some regions in china have seen the break@@ out of highly contagious avian influenza recently .
the party central leadership and the state council attach great importance to the situation and have swiftly made a series of important decisions , specifying guidelines and policy measures for epidemic prevention and cure .
regions and departments concerned took prompt action , sparing no efforts to prevent the spread of the epidemic under the leadership of the party central leadership and the state council .
currently , nationwide avian influenza prevention and cure work is being carried out in an intensive and orderly way .
highly contagious avian influenza is an animal epidemic that spreads fast and can do great damage . it is a severe threat to husbandry and the health and safety of the general public .
to effectively carry out the avian influenza prevention and cure work holds great importance to the health and safety of the general public , to agriculture development and the income increase of the peasants , to overall situation of economic development , and to social stability . under the guidance of the " three represents " theory and following the animal epidemic prevention law of the people 's republic of china , regions and departments shall strengthen leadership and coordination , follow science and the law in conducting prevention and cure work , mobilize the general public to participate the prevention and cure work , and deal with the situation with great determination . the war against the avian influenza is to be won by working under the spirit of serving the people hear@@ tily and carefully and effectively carrying out all the prevention and cure measures .
the foreign debts of the united states , the biggest debtor in the world , have continued to increase .
according to the us treasury announcement on jan 16 , the us debts to various foreign creditors amount to us $ 6,@@ 4@@ 94 billion as of last september , an increase by 2.2 % over the previous figure .
each american has a foreign debt of over 20,000 dollars on the average .
the im@@ f , incidentally , published a study report a week earlier t@@ oll@@ ing the warning bell against the prec@@ arious financial infrastructure of the united states , systematically and ac@@ utely saying that the continued record - breaking us foreign debts have reached a level that could threaten the global financial security .
according to statistics , foreign private investors control about 40 % of us government bonds .
this reminds us of the proposal made by key@@ n@@ es to president ro@@ os@@ evel@@ t in the first half of the 20th century : to stimulate the domestic economy through deficit financing and raise foreign debts to cancel out the deficits .
this has been important in stimulating " effective demands " to resolve the extreme ur@@ gencies during the economic crisis .
however , we see that many us administrations have tended to resort to this method as the " eli@@ x@@ ir . "
however , since president re@@ agan called for tax abatement and arms expansion in the 1980s , the us financial deficits have been gradually increasing , finally leading the us to the position of the biggest debtor .
the convening of the first round of six - party talks is an important step forward in the dialog process for the peaceful resolution of the korean pen@@ insul@@ ar nuclear issue .
several common points have been reached at by the parties in the talks , laying down the necessary foundation for the continuation of the talks and pin@@ pointing the goal , means , and guidelines for the resolution of the korean pen@@ insul@@ ar nuclear issue .
over the past few months , the parties involved have stuck to resolving the korean pen@@ insul@@ ar nuclear issue through peaceful talks , conducting coordination and discussions at different levels on the basis of the first round of six - party talks , and working hard for the early convening of the second round of talks .
at the same time , north korea and the united states have shown flexibility to some degree .
with important progress made in the preparation for the new talks , it is the hope of all the parties to make the second round a success .
all parties concerned and the international community at large attach importance to the results of the second round of six - party talks and are eager to see if it would be able to help the dialog process move along .
in this connection , a spokesperson of the chinese foreign ministry said that the goal of the six - party talks is to keep the dialog process for peaceful resolution on and move it forward and that china is ready to work together with other parties in this regard .
the basic starting point of china is to maintain peace and stability in the korean pen@@ insul@@ ar and achieve the non@@ nu@@ clear@@ ization in the korean pen@@ insul@@ ar .
the chinese side believes that favorable conditions for the resolution of related issues are forthcoming so long as the parties concerned hold on to the good faith , mutual respect , and equality in the talks .
at the end of 1970s , the us - lib@@ ya relation deteriorated and the two countries severed diplomatic relations in 1981 .
us president re@@ agan listed a long string of charges against lib@@ ya leader q@@ add@@ af@@ i , such as accusing lib@@ ya of secretly developing nuclear weapons , military interference in other countries internal affairs and terrorism , etc.
the fight between the two side upgraded from verbal attack to real war . the us lau@@ ched 2 surgical air raids against lib@@ ya , namely " operation pr@@ airi@@ e fire " and " operation el dor@@ ado can@@ y@@ on " .
the us put up economic sanctions , political blow , diplomatic containment and military threats toward lib@@ ya h@@ ence@@ forth .
but facing the heavy pressure , q@@ add@@ af@@ i refused to give in .
at present , the us - lib@@ ya relations is warming up , but it cannot be completely owed to the deterrent effect of the iraq war as some people view it .
in fact , the unique - charac@@ tered q@@ add@@ af@@ i always held out ol@@ i@@ ver branch to the us while cont@@ ending with super power . but regret@@ fully , the us did not respond .
all parties in the middle east adjusted their strategy in the post iraq war era . regional forces were re@@ grouping , which provided opportunity to the us and lib@@ ya to re@@ establish diplomatic relations .
to q@@ add@@ aff@@ i , repairing the connection with the us can end sanctions , revive the economy , improve people 's living and break away from isolation and return to the international community .
lib@@ ya gives up what it could not obtain in present time to exchange for a new international environment out of a sur@@ pressing and dark situation .
from 7 - 8 fe@@ bur@@ ary , government heads of the eu , the us and other regions in the world gathered in mun@@ ich , germany , attending the 40th mun@@ ich conference on security policy .
the so - called " mun@@ ich conference of security policy " was founded by non - governmental sources , which is a forum on international security issues funded by the german government . it increasingly attracts people 's attention after the " 9.@@ 11 " terrorist attack , and is honored as the " d@@ avo@@ s forum " in the security field .
a major topic of this conference is cross - at@@ lan@@ tic relations .
opinions that the senior officials from europe and the us expressed both in the conference and at the sid@@ elines shows that the two sides are trying to shake off the shadow thrown to their relation@@ a by the iraq war and make efforts to drag the cooperation back to the right track .
the director of german institute for international politics and security (@@ sw@@ p@@ ) in ber@@ lin , dr@@ . ber@@ tram says that this is a conference repairing the eu - us relations and the two sides both have the desire to getting closer .
to the eu - us relations , as the new message sent out from the conference , is that the eu and the us needs to renew dialogues , carefully consider the mutual tasks faced by both sides and find out conver@@ gencies of the interests of both sides necessary for fulfilling these mutual tasks .
in contrast with the conference last year , the smell of gunpowder in this conference dis@@ appears and the stances of both sides are getting closer .
the " old europe " , represented by france and germany express their willingness to " looking forward " , though they still gr@@ udge over the us - led iraq war .
the german foreign minister f@@ ischer says at the conference : " although we have different views on the war , we have to ensure peace in post - war iraq , therefore , we must look forward . "
germany would not block the nato to directly function in iraq , while germany would not send troops to the country , he added .
the us gras@@ ps in@@ ni@@ ti@@ ative in the modern media field and monopol@@ izes a major part of the right of expression internationally . its ten@@ n@@ acle of propaganda has spread globally to be perv@@ asive in every@@ way . why does it need to investment a gigantic amount of money to set up a satellite channel covering 22 middle east countries in particular now .
according to the chief of the " al - hur@@ ra " , the channel aims to provide the arab countries with a news platform containing " complete and fair views " .
but analysts point out that al - hur@@ ra will be a strategic weapon of the us to carry out media pen@@ ne@@ tr@@ ation , cultural invasion and psychological attacks against the arab coun@@ tre@@ is and serve as the important instrument of propaganda to integrate the middle east and transform the isl@@ amic world .
in this aspect , al - hur@@ ra has uncommon missions . there are 3 most important ones . the first is to spread the " ideal and concept of freedom " .
the us holds the view that the isl@@ amic civilization is the grave hinder for the west to boost the modern civilization and the isl@@ amic extremism is the bed of the international terrorism with the anti - us sentiments and actions as the main character . it is necessary to transform the isl@@ amic world , force it recognize and accept the western values and concepts , living style and political system to effectively strike terrorism , as the us upholds .
the us attempts to exert a subtle influence and beat its own ideology into the arab minds .
the second is to improve the image of the us .
the us pursues a unilateral foreign policy , par@@ ading its ability and act recklessly in a series of international issues . its arbitrary deeds en@@ r@@ aged the arab countries and the whole isl@@ amic world .
after the " 9.@@ 11 " attack , the confrontation between the us , always taking side with israel , and the isl@@ amic countries in the middle east intensified .
the us invaded and occupied iraq by force in the name of remove weapons of mass destruction and countering terrorism without authentic proofs and un authorization , which aroused fierce anti@@ pa@@ thy in the muslim public .
pak@@ istani and indian officials held talks between 16 and 18 january in isl@@ am@@ abad , the hope of peace rises again on above the south asia sub@@ continent .
officials of both countries fixed the pattern and agenda of future talks , setting up a sustained dialogue mechanism , which marks the renewed start - up of the process of the pakistan and india talks after being suspended for 2 years . it establishes the basis for the two countries to resolve all unsettled issues , including the kash@@ mir conflict , and demonstrates precious sincerity of both sides for peace .
before this meeting , analysts held cautious attitude to the prospect of the peace process , although the bilateral relations were war@@ med up by a series of good - w@@ illed gestures from both sides .
it is not strange as the pakistan - india relations saw drastic ups and downs in the past few years . it seems that no one can assure that sunshine over the negotiation table would not turn into thunder storms across the borders .
however , as the pakistan foreign secretary ri@@ az k@@ ho@@ k@@ har read out the joint communique of the two countries smil@@ ingly on 18 january , a spirit of optimism spread again , which bri@@ ghtened the eyes of many people concerning about the south asia situation .
first , the time table fixed in this meeting has very strong maneu@@ ver@@ ability . both sides not only clear@@ ified the detailed time and topics for the talks , but also prescribed various levels of talks according to the priority of each topic .
second , both sides learned a lesson from the failure of the direct dialogue in the ag@@ ra summit between the leaders in last july . a " step by step " way of dialogue was adopted . the talks would be un@@ wrapped from the lower level to the higher level to sufficiently prepare for the summit meeting .
third , after experiencing several ups and downs of the bilateral relationship , the two countries con@@ for@@ ma@@ bly indicate that war is not a good way to resolve disputes and both sides should keep far away from wars . this consensus lays the basis for the leadership of both countries to reach the understanding that " pakistan and india will never see each other in the battle field " .
to compreh@@ es@@ i@@ vely and correctly understand the principle of " one country two systems " , " one country " should be unified with " two systems " , " patriotism " with " love for hong kong " , and the respect to hong kong 's high level autonomy with adherence to socialism as the main body of the state political system .
it is the only way to effectively protect the happiness and well - being of the hong kong compatriots as well as to keep with the long term interests of the nation and the people as a whole .
since hong kong 's return to the motherland , the central government has unswervingly carried out the principle of " one country two systems " and strictly handled affairs according to the basic law .
the broad masses of hong kong compatriots enjoys unprecedented democratic rights as the master of hong kong .
hong kong over@@ com@@ ed various risks and challenges such as the strike of the asia financial crisis and continued to maintain the status as the international financial , trade and communication center .
as tested and proved in practices , the principle of " one country two systems " has strong vitality .
today , to mention the speech made by com@@ er@@ ade deng xia@@ oping 20 years ago demonstrates the staunch determination of the central government to carry through and fulfil the " one country two systems " policy , promote the comprehensive and correct understanding of the " one country two systems " policy and thus consist@@ antly push forward the great practice of the " one country two systems " principle .
the central commission of the communist party and the state council held a grand national awarding ceremony for science and technology here today .
president hu j@@ intao awards prizes to academician liu d@@ ong@@ sheng and wang yong@@ zhi , who win the highest prize of science and technology of the country in the year 2003 .
the board of the award issues prizes to scientific and technological workers , such as china 's manned spaceflight project that wins the prize for national advanced technology and those that wins the national natural science prize , the national prize of technology and invention and other scientific workers that win the national prize of advanced technology .
on behalf of the central committee of the communist party of china and the state council , i would like to express my warmest congratulations to all prize winners .
and i would like to present my sincere regards and highest respect to the scientists and technicians in various fields of endeavor !
for china , the first 20 years of this century is a significant strategic period of opportunity that we should seize firmly and in which we are able to develop our ability to the full .
we should focus our strength to build a higher - level@@ ed well - off society that will benefit billions of people in an all round way .
to well use this strategic period of opportunity and strive to accomplish some achiev@@ ments , the development of science and technology should be placed in a more prior and prominent position .
after the " 9.@@ 11 " terrorist attack , the us president bush launched the strategy of " pre - emptive strike " , which is committed to us diplomatic practices , and the us fight the first " pre - emptive war " last march in ir@@ q@@ a .
the theory of " pre - emptive strike " not only is against international law wh@@ ith the core principle of " mutual respect to one another 's sovereignty and territorial integrity " , but also will inevitably rou@@ se the dangerous effect of mass imitation and the international order will appear new turbul@@ ance as a result .
before the lau@@ ch of the theory of " pre - emptive strike " , some us senior officials raised a question , " what if other countries imitate one after another ? "
just as expected , more and more countries have claimed to carry " pre - emptive strike " and the member of the " pre - emptive sti@@ ke " team increased for the past two year .
this is a new movement worthy of attention .
just in the month when bush lan@@ ched the strategy of " pre - emptive strike " , australian prime minister h@@ oward was the first one that stood out for it .
once reliable information about terrorist attack to australia were obtained , australia would adopt " pre - emptive strikes " against the terrorists , even ris@@ king military operation in the neighboring countries , he said .
he even suggested to inscri@@ be the " pre - emptive strike " principle into the un char@@ ters . he thought that it was necessary to amend the un char@@ ters to give all countries the right of " pre - emptive strike " so as to crack down terrorists and countries supporting terrorism .
in north - east asia , the japan 's ministry of defense proposed in the white paper of defense as early as july 1999 , that japan could implement " pre - emptive strike " against foreign bases if facing missile attack or military invasion .
after the iraq war , japan 's advoc@@ ation of the " pre - emptive strike " strategy went rif@@ e and rampant .
many comments on us present africa policy appear in international press recently
a us periodical , foreign policy in focus issued january published an article entitled " africa policy outlook 2004 " . it holds the view that the bush administration 's foreign policy already has had negative effect over africa directly or indirectly . when the us all goes out to attend the anti - terrorist war and the proliferation of mass destruction weapons , especially when the us is completely att@@ acted to iraq , the attention to africa is largely distr@@ acted .
people still remember that the bush administration used to establish the president 's emergency plan for aids relief , promising to provide at least 3 billion us dollars to africa each year , in order to show the concern to africa .
president bush visited 5 african countries as sen@@ eg@@ al , south africa , bot@@ swana , ug@@ anda and n@@ ig@@ eria successively last july . he promised to aid the african countries with 15 billion us dollars for aids relief , and another 0.1 billion us dollars for counter - terrorism in africa . he also announced aid programs to africa like the emergency food aid plan and the emergency education aid plan .
these aid programs used to be welcomed by african countries at a time and scored quite a lot appl@@ au@@ ds in the world .
however , a year passed , real actions from the us fail to come even after long delay .
africa is star@@ ving for emergency aids .
entering the new century , africa faces even more challenges in development . african countries established " the africa union " , an organization coordinating the african affairs as a whole , to fulfil the un millennium development goal 2000 aiming to strive to reduce hunger and poverty , promote health and education . they also constituted the " new partnership plan for african development " aiming at enhance development of all african countries . but as a result of weak economic basis , it always lacks fund of development .
the un has called the developed countries to use 0.7 % of its g@@ d@@ p as official aids to the most un@@ developed countries for many time .
however , us official aids only takes 0.1 % of its g@@ d@@ p , that shows a wide gap with un 's request , ranking last in the don@@ ators .
recently , the euro@@ pe@@ ans are discussing a hot topic , i.e . , are meetings between the " 3 heads " , namely german chancellor sch@@ ro@@ der , french president ch@@ irac and british prime minister bl@@ air , coming into a mechanism .
the " 3 heads " , germany , france and britain are called as the " new 3 carriages " of the eu , and the tril@@ ateral relationship the " new tri@@ ag@@ le " .
the " new tri@@ angle " is a newly emerging thing . its evolution aw@@ aits observation . but no matter from what angle it is viewed , this " new tri@@ angle " seems good to the european integration on the whole , and thus helps the europe to play an important role in the intern@@ ati@@ o@@ inal arena as one pillar of the multi - pol@@ arizing world .
in retro@@ spect of the european history in the past century , the tri@@ angular relation of germany , france and the uk has a basic characteristic , i.e . , the uk and france coalition restraining and resisting germany .
the 2 world wars were proofs .
during the cold war , the two ger@@ man@@ ies , east germany and west germany were restrained inside the war@@ saw pact and nato .
after the cold war , the unified germany grew stronger , the power structure of western europe went unbalanced . france got more suspicious , that once disabled the " germany - france axis " , and push uk and france to get closer again with the same attempt to contain germany .
eu countries run into severe disagreement on the iraq issue , as a result of a renewed functioning of the " germany - france axis " and the veh@@ ement collision between the conceptions of uni - polarity vs multi - polarity .
the " old europe " represented by germany and france entirely differentiate with the " new europe " represented by the uk and poland on the iraq issue .
this split just falls on the biggest coming eu expansion in history .
egy@@ ptian president mu@@ barak addressed on the reform of arab countries in c@@ air@@ o days ago , criticizing the outside of infl@@ iting sing@@ ular reform mode to the arab countries and warned that this attempt could only be just the opposite to what is wished and no good to the peace and stability of the middle east .
he holds the view that reform should be conducted according to the characteristics and abilities of each arab countries , but the sing@@ ular reform mode ignores different cultural backgrounds , social norms and religious features of different countries .
he points out at the same time that the arab countries welcome help from the outside during the process of reform , but this kind of efforts should be based on the clear knowledge of different national situations and respect wishes of different countries , and thus give impetus to the reform process of arab countries in the political , economic , and cultural respect .
this remark of the egy@@ ptian leader represents the mutual view of the arab countries .
at present , under the pressure of counter - terrorism , anti - proliferation and democratic reform , the middle east , as one of the hot spots in the world , is fer@@ ment@@ ing new turmoil and will result in a new round of integration .
experiencing the af@@ gh@@ an and iraq wars , how will iraq carry out political rebuilding as one of the " axis of evil " looked upon by the us ?
how will various political systems and social patterns in the middle east evolve ?
this is not only the concern of the arab world and the international community , but also what the us and its western allies are interested .
us secretary of state pow@@ ell reiterated after meeting the visiting ba@@ h@@ rain@@ i crow@@ ned prince sal@@ man in washington on 9 fe@@ bu@@ ary that the us would pursue the " plan of western democracy and capitalism " in iraq and the middle east at large .
he also stressed , " we are considering what we could do still to system@@ ize it . "
the year 2003 is the " year of culture and education " named by the international oly@@ mpic committee .
the beijing oly@@ mpic committee used this great opportunity to hold a series of educational activities that disseminated advanced culture and the knowledge of the oly@@ mp@@ ics .
among these activities , the publishing of the " a readers ' book about the knowledge of the oly@@ mp@@ ics for middle school students " with the young boys and girls as its main reader group , is a very important one .
this book is rich in words and full of pictures , which systematically and vividly introduces the oly@@ mp@@ ics games and the essence of oly@@ mpic spirits . as a good teaching material , it could help enhance the young students ' awareness of the oly@@ mpic sports and promote the ard@@ or of social participation in the oly@@ mp@@ ics .
last year , the beijing oly@@ mpic committee produced special designed course tables for students , marked with oly@@ mpic logo and made of renewable paper .
the idea of a " green oly@@ mp@@ ics " is to organize and prepare for the oly@@ mpic games in accordance with the concept of protecting the environment , the ecological balance and sustainable development .
we hope that these course tables can regulate the deeds of young students like the set courses , to make them the practitioners and advoc@@ ators for the concept of the " green oly@@ mp@@ ics " .
education is one of the essential content of the oly@@ mpic games as well as an important demonstration of the " human and cultural oly@@ mp@@ ics " .
the real mission of the oly@@ mpic games is to educate the young people from a new respect and throu@@ ght a new way , to boost the coo@@ din@@ ated development of the bodies and minds of the young people , and thus contribute in creating a peaceful and beautiful world .
therefore , the combination of sports and education not only opens a new world to the development of education , but also end@@ ows a more educational meaning to the oly@@ mp@@ ics .
" green oly@@ mp@@ ics " is one of the three ideas of the beijing oly@@ mpic games in 2008 .
the essential content is to promote the environmental quality of the capital largely , create beautiful environmental for the oly@@ mpic games and build up a ecological city .
environmental technologies and measure should be applied widely to meet this end , such as put forward large scale and multi - oriented environmental control and rectification , constantly enhancing the social awareness of environmental protection and encouraging the public to actively participate various activities concerning ecological environment improvement .
to well manage the implementation of the " green oly@@ mp@@ ics " is an important task to adhere to human@@ istic policies and adopt the all - round , coordinated and sustainable scientific concept of development as well as boost the complete , coordinated and sustained economic and social development of beijing .
we must attach great importance to it .
to realize the goal of " green oly@@ mp@@ ics " , the beijing municipality has compiled the " oly@@ mpic action plan " and " ecological and environmental protection plan " on the base of the " tenth 5 - year plan " and the " bidding report " , which set up new targets and plans for environmental construction and protection in the next few years .
it will hit the target of a " green oly@@ mp@@ ics " through implementing the above plans step by step .
the us state department issued the " 2003 human rights reports " on fe@@ bu@@ ary 25 , which n@@ it - picks upon the human rights situation of 190 countries and regions inclusive of china in a completely ped@@ ag@@ og@@ u@@ ish tone . it says that the human rights situation in many countries was bad , and other countries backed up in some pivotal areas of human rights , and so and so .
of course , there still were countries where the human rights situation witnessed great improvement , such as af@@ gh@@ anistan and iraq , thanks to the us army over@@ throwing the former regime and " liberating " them though .
but what about the human rights in the us ?
the report sp@@ ares any comment as usual , no comment at all .
the information office of the state council of china issued the " human rights record of the united states in 2003 " on march 1 , which patches up the inadequacy of the us human rights report .
the article refers to the human rights problems of the us and its t@@ resp@@ assing on the human rights of other countries , in accordance with vast facts .
the americ@@ ans have a tradition of credibility in history and always think that a wrong must be righ@@ ted when done .
as all know , the story of the young ge@@ orge washington ax@@ eing the ch@@ erry tree is a vivid example .
on the contrary , now , the us is reluctant to tell the truth when it becomes the only super power in the world .
these days the mainstream media of japan quietly changed in reporting the economic development of china .
on the contrary with the former " china threat " theory , many reports in japan hold the view that china 's economic development boo@@ sts japan 's recovery , and the flourishing market demand in china has become significant impetus to japan 's economic development .
an article on the us magazine " news week " recently also says that china 's growth is an opportunity instead of challenge to other countries , expec@@ ially china 's neighboring countries .
the once well - known " china threat " theory is being replaced by the " china opportunity " theory .
the " china threat " theory asserts that china 's growth would impose threats to other countries , especially the neighboring countries .
however , this assertion that means to make mis@@ chief has not been accepted by china 's neighbors .
the former mal@@ ay prime minister ma@@ ha@@ thir remarked straight@@ forwar@@ dly , " asia countries need not to be afraid of china 's growing military and economic power , for china does not have a tradition of conqu@@ ering other countries . "
even a long perspective plan issued by the india defense ministry says that china is not a military threat to india .
the governments of all countries all regard china as the best choice for market expansion . foreign investors with strategic vision firmly prove the " china opportunity " theory throu@@ ght their actions . among the first 500 companies in the world , 400 has invested in china .
china ranks at the fore in attracting foreign investment in the world in the past few years constantly .
g@@ d@@ p is an important universal index for macro - economy .
it is vital to keep the growth of g@@ d@@ p in the whole modernization process of china .
for a simple example , more than 800,000 job opportunities would occur at each percentage growth of the g@@ d@@ p of our country . therefore we must maintain the fast growth momentum of the economy .
the realization of the goal of the 3rd step of the modernization and constructing a well - off society in an all round way should be supported by a sustained fast growth of g@@ d@@ p in a large degree .
however , we also should see that the g@@ d@@ p has its own limitations .
for instance , it is slow in indicating the quality of economic growth and structure , the living standard that people practically enjoy and in@@ ac@@ ur@@ ate in indicating the social distribution and social fairness , etc.
on the other hand , the g@@ d@@ p is not the only standard .
to evaluate the economic performance , we should consider not only the g@@ d@@ p growth , but also the practical living standards of the people , the unemployment rate , social security , social order , social management and social harmony , etc.
thus , we should treat the g@@ d@@ p examination and calculation system with scientific spirit , attitude and method , rectifying the position of g@@ d@@ p in the whole social development .
a certain growth rate should be sustained , but not be stressed too much , and it should not be persu@@ ed unilaterally and deliberately still .
after the visit to the 6 countries in western africa last june by the security council delegation , the overall situation of the region saw encouraging changes , though some revers@@ als took place once in a couple of countries .
we gladly note that the si@@ erra le@@ one government is upgrading the ability of its army and police and making possi@@ tive progress in strengthening the control of its diam@@ onds and preparing the local government election . the scale of the un assistance mission in si@@ erra le@@ one is also cutting short according to the fixed plan gradually .
it is equally gratifying that lib@@ ya is shaking off the influence of long term chaos caused by war and starting the way of recovery and reconstruction , as planned by the un assistance mission in si@@ erra le@@ one .
the political process in gu@@ ine@@ a - bis@@ sa@@ u has also made positive progress . the transitional government has promised to hold elections of legislature in march .
the peace process in co@@ te d ' i@@ vo@@ ir are meeting a new chance after some setbacks . all parties promised to carry out the " lin@@ as - mar@@ cous@@ sis agreement " . the " new army " claimed to return to the national conciliation government and the security council is considering sending peace keeping forces to the country .
we are expecting the secur@@ ti@@ y council to make the decision over this problem as soon as possible .
concerning parties as the un secretariat and the economic community of west african states (@@ ec@@ ow@@ as@@ ) are also making efforts from the regional perspective to solve the trans@@ boundary problems of small weapons , the merc@@ enary army , child army and have made positive achievements .
while the above progresses are fully affirmed , we should also acknowledge that the overall situation of western africa is still very prec@@ arious . for geographical and historical reason in particular , coun@@ tires in this region are linked closely and inter@@ acted . turbul@@ ance in one countries often spread to or tam@@ per with others .
therefore , the international community , including the security council must adopt a comprehensive and all - around strategy to solve the problems in western africa , as suggested by the report of the security council . greater efforts should be made in solving the trans@@ boundary problems . the international community should also actively help the concerning countries as well as regional organizations as the africa union and ec@@ ow@@ as , enhancing their ability in preventing and solving problems .
we have a mutual understanding that children are future of the world .
we are obliged to create the best and most suitable conditions for their lives and study as well as for their growth , maturity and success .
however , it is reg@@ re@@ table that there are still thousands of children are fully exposed to injuries and bereav@@ ement made by armed conflicts .
what they experienced are turmoil and under - development , what they see are violence and destruction , what they suffer are hur@@ ts and abuses and what they feel are sorrow and helplessness .
thus , it is an import@@ ment responsi@@ bl@@ ity of the international community to protect children from hurt of armed conflicts .
each country , especially those in armed conflicts should put out for this in an utmost degree .
we gladly saw that the un took a series of actions to protect children in the armed conflicts and achieved positive results .
the security council passed 4 resolutions as the 12@@ 61 ( 1999 ) , 13@@ 14 ( 2000 ) , 13@@ 79 ( 2001 ) and 14@@ 60 ( 2003 ) , providing important framework for the work of protecting children .
the peace keeping operations deployed by the un in some regions take it an important job to protect children , including appointing advisors of child protection to help the countries to fully consider the special needs of children when they are implementing des@@ armament , demobil@@ ization and the plan of returning to society .
some peace agreements reached under the promotion and participation of the un also contain terms of child protection .
nation reconciliation is an important pre - condition in building sustained peace and stability in the confl@@ icted regions .
after conflicts stop , if the concerning parties did not rel@@ ingu@@ ish past fuel , the peaceful situation could not be really solidi@@ fied and the conflicts could even spark@@ le again .
in many circumstances , it needs the mutual endeavor of all parties concerned to achieve national reconciliation after conflicts as well as supports and facilitation of the international community , especially the un .
in many years , the un played a constructive role in the process of helping the confl@@ icted countries bring about national reconciliation and accumulated many experiences . we think , on the whole , the un must appropriately handle the following 3 relationships to successfully help bring about national reconciliation in confl@@ icted countries :
to give att@@ entions to both the immediate needs and long term goals .
national reconciliation usually need a certain course , and it cannot be accomplished in one action .
it should be focused differently in different phases .
to promote national reconciliation , the armed personnel should " say farewell to their arms " first and create a safe environment .
in this phase , it is very important to dis@@ arm and demobil@@ ize the military personnel and let them return to the society .
we are glad to see that there is growing stability in bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina , as w@@ ll further tem@@ pered relations between various nationalities , beginning of economic recovery , returning of refugees by and large and gradual improvement of relationship with neighboring countries .
it is gratifying that the peace process of bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina could reach such hard - earned progress .
we sincerely extend our congratulations to the government and people of bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina and whole - hear@@ tedly hope all parties in bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina to making constant efforts in furthering mutual understanding and cooperation to boost the peace process continually .
we also noted that the construction of abilities and institution at the national level of bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina aw@@ aits completion , expec@@ ially that the judicial and police fields still face challenges .
we think that it is appropriate for the high - level representatives to take it as the priority of the work in the first half of the year . we support that government of bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina to be cooperative with the high - level representatives .
we believe that with the help of the international community , the people of bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina will continue to make accomplishments on the way of constructing their own country and stepping onto a way of independent development , and thus , realizing the aim of joining the european unification .
the peace and stability of bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina have great significance to realize sustained peace and development of the region .
china has always concerned about the development of the situation in bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina , and will make our contribution to help bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina to realize prolonged peace and stability .
china appreciates the efforts made by the anti - terrorism committee to urge countries to implement the 13@@ 73 ( 2001 ) resolution , to help the developing countries construct their anti - terrorist ability and to support strengthening coordination and cooperation between the anti - terrorism committee and related international , regional and sub - regional organizations .
meanwhile , we hope the anti - terrorism committee to intensify the anti - terrorist aid , striving to satisfy the practical demands of the developing countries .
a present , it rou@@ ses concerns of many member countries to revitalize the anti - terrorism committee .
through repeated consultation , the anti - terrorism committee proposed a formal report and handed it to the security council to give off as documents .
after practices in two years , the anti - terrorism committee showed obvious in@@ abilities in structure and operation mechanism , such as too much burden to the member countries in turning in reports , too many meetings and documents , low effectiveness and insufficient coordination between the experts .
therefore , we completely support the anti - terrorism committee to carry out necessary reforms . we agree with the package plans like founding an executive council for the anti - terrorism committee proposed by the report . we also hope that these problems could be resolved appropriately , and the burden to the member countries in turning in reports should be considered as a priority .
what we want to stress here is that the revitalization and reform is a continuous process . no matter how the reform would proceed , the anti - terrorism committee should keep to be indu@@ cive and directive to the executive council , and any decision should be based on the unanimous agreement of the general assembly of the anti - terrorism committee .
in recent years , the issue of small weapons is always a focus of attention of the international community .
it shows that all parties has realized that the excessive accumulation and illegal trafficking of small weapons has done great harms to the stability , post@@ war reconstruction and social development to countries and regions concerned .
fortunately , the un has taken a series of effective actions to solve this problem .
in 2001 , the " firearms protocol " to be attached to the " united nations convention against transnational organized crime " and the un program of action on small weapons have reached successively .
they provide legal and policy basis for proper settlement of the issue of small weapons , demonstrating the determination of the international community to strike illegal trade of small weapons .
in the past 3 years , the international community made great progress in advancing the effectiveness of the firearms protocol and carrying out the program of action . the first bi - annual un conference of small weapons in 2003 provide new impetus to continually carry out the program of action in an all - embracing and feasible way .
this un general assembly passed the 5@@ 8/@@ 2@@ 41 resolution , deciding to establish a task force to draft an international document for the recogn@@ ization and investigation of small weapons through negotiation , which would further boost the strike to illegal trade of small weapons by the international community undoubtedly .
the security council attaches increasing importance to the issue of small weapons as well . it used to carried out special deliberations and passed relative statement of chairperson and resolution .
besides , the security council emphasize the importance of handling the issue of small weapons while considering a series of issues such as how to protect civilians , women and children in armed conflicts .
economic development and poverty elimination are basics for realizing sustainable development .
the sustainable economic development is the material basis of environmental protection and all - round social development .
without solving the issue of subsistence , there is no development , let along sustainable development .
it is the only way to sustainable development for the developing countries to boost economic growth and strive to eliminate poverty .
the growth of developed countries could not continue , if the poverty issue in the developing countries is left unresolved .
reasonable resources utilization and environmental protection are pre@@ requisites for sustainable development .
development could not sustained at the cost of wasting resources and sacrificing environment .
natural res@@ ou@@ ces are not in@@ exha@@ ust@@ able , but the demand of the human society is constantly increasing . if the relationship between the two is not handle properly , it must result in deteriorating of the ecological environment and thus , seriously hamper the subsistence and development of the human kind .
the sustainable development could not be realized , only if the way of rotating economy that is based on utmost effectiveness of resource utilization and environmental protection were taken .
the ultimate goal of sustainable development is to realized the all - round social development and elevation of people 's living standards and quality .
a year ago , the 9th ap@@ ec summit was held by the huang@@ pu river@@ side , and we still remember every scene at that time .
today , we gather at the pic@@ tu@@ res@@ que los c@@ abo@@ s on the other side of the pacific to discuss the a major program of lasting importance of the asia - pacific economic cooperation .
i am very glad to see so many old friends .
taking this opportunity , i would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to president fo@@ x for his kind invitation and the m@@ exic@@ an government the meticulous arrangements .
in the past year , the trend of economic globalization continued to expand , scientific and technological still made headway forward , which bring all countries with opportunity of growth .
meanwhile , uncertainty grows in the global economic development , including some countries and regions in ap@@ ec has been facing with new challenges during their process of development .
the trade protectionism comes back and it is still a long way to realize free , equ@@ ar@@ l and just trade .
striking terrorism is an arduous and complicated task , and the non - traditional security factors somehow increase .
this world of ours is still not at peace .
although the international comm@@ mun@@ ity still faces all sorts of problems , and all sorts of unexpected problems might occur in the future , but peace and development , as the trend of the time is not revers@@ able , and the aspiration of living a nice life of people of all countries stays unchanged .
this dialogue meeting focuses on development , which is very significant .
development is the basis for advance of human civilization , and is the key to various conflicts and problems that man faces globally .
only the realization of globally coordinated , balanced and general development can achieve sustained peace and stability in the world .
we should probe into this issue completely and deeply , and make concerted efforts to solve it .
the speeded trend of economic globalization has become one of the most prominent characteristics of the current world economy .
pushed by the trend of economic g@@ ob@@ alization , connections between countries and regions are getting increasingly closer , market more open and flow of capital , technology and human resources broader and faster , all that bring unprecedented opportunities for enhancing international cooperation and mutual development .
at the same time , economic globalization brings about severe challenges . the gap between the north and the south is widened . some developing countries are facing the danger of margin@@ alization , increased economic and financial risks and serious trans@@ boundary crimes . and all these have aug@@ mented the pressure for international cooperation to collectively facing challenges .
at the moment of both opportunities and challenges , we should seize the opportunities and face the challenges , seeking common points while reserving difference , as well as dealing with the challenges , expanding cooperation as well as boost economic globalization , and leading the ec@@ nom@@ ic globalization to evolve toward mutual prosperity .

( intern@@ ation ) den@@ mark issue new act to limit immigration
stock@@ holm , j@@ an@@ . 28 , xinhua according to report from cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen : the dan@@ is government submitted a new act to limit immigration to the parliament today .
according to the act , children of foreign immigrants born in den@@ mark would no longer entitled to voluntarily acquire the d@@ anish nationality .
the act was the newest one in a series of immigration limitation measures since the leader of the den@@ mark liberal party anders fo@@ gh r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen took up the post of the prime minister in november 2001 .
it is very probable that the act could be approved by the parliament as reported , for the liberal party had the support of the right wing den@@ mark people 's party on the issue of immigration .
the act requires that the children of foreigners born in den@@ mark should apply for den@@ mark nationality as other immigrants rather than voluntarily obtain the den@@ mark citizenship .
the already nation@@ alized immigrants would be stripped off their citizenship , if they committed crimes that seriously harm the society .
in the past two years , the d@@ anish govern@@ ent pushed out a series of measure to limit immigration , including res@@ tic@@ tions in issuing green cards and limiting this immigrants bringing their relatives to den@@ mark , etc. .
since the d@@ anish government holds an un@@ friendly attitude toward immigrants , the number foreign asylum seekers in den@@ mark falls from 14,@@ 3@@ 47 in 1993 to 3,500 in 2003 .
it also damages the international image of a free and human right country that den@@ mark always boasts .
the achievements singapore reached cannot be take for granted .
no matter how advanced are the technologies , i still do not believe that people could maintain an ideal environment of higher living standard and quality , full employment and ever increasing salaries without working hard , keeping social pr@@ ici@@ ples or adapting to changes .
all these nice things could not be obtained only naturally .
only that all the people acknowledge that they should weigh more on the collective interests and make difficult compromises and necessary adjustments , all of us could embrace a more beautiful future .
what will be singapore in 10 to 20 years ?
we all hope that we could foresee the future , but the future is not for@@ s@@ eable .
many factors are out of the control of singapore .
the evolution of many things are decided by the development of the world situation .
we do not know when problem will occur . sometimes , it is a matter of luck .
for instance , 3 singap@@ ore@@ ans travelled to hong kong and contracted s@@ ars . this was not for@@ se@@ eable .
in less than a month after the spring festival , china had witnessed 3 worst accidents and scores of people died in each one of them .
the extremely high frequency of accidents and heavy death toll make people feel heart@@ ach@@ ingly regret .
several months before this , the gas well bl@@ ow@@ out accident in ch@@ ong@@ qing , quite a few gas explosion accidents and frequent grave traffic accidents has already caused several hun@@ dr@@ ads of deaths .
china has a vast territory and dense population . the rate of disasters taking place in china is much higher than in other countries . it is objectively the fact of no way out that the accidents often involve dozens or hundreds of deaths .
but , if we view it by comm@@ en sense , there are still too many accidents claiming lives in china .
in so many disasters , there are mostly fires , coal mine explosion , fireworks workshop explosion and passenger traffic accidents .
this at least makes two points : firstly , that the safety measures in these fields are the weak@@ est , and secondly , people do not learn lessons from the past tragedies . that is why the same kind of accidents constantly take place .
during the period when singapore used to witness the fast economic growth , serious fire accidents took plac@@ ee and the miserable memory remains clear still , which quickly promoted the security awareness of public areas in singapore .
china is now in a critical period of fast economic growth and social reform , too .
the incidents that foreign house m@@ aids working locally accidentally fall down from tall buildings are heard from time to time . although the rate of such accidents is still not unreasonably high , but the frequency of the kind of accidental jumping off buildings is after all far from the tiny casualty rate as the nature of their work , given the comparatively safe environment at homes .
according to statistics , from january 1999 to june 2003 , 99 foreign house m@@ aids of various nationalities fall off buildings accidentally .
behind these figures , there are broken families waiting for their daughters and mothers who will never be back and mis@@ fortunes that should have been prevented . it is , at the same time , the direction toward which we should strive to cut the reg@@ re@@ table number to the minimum .
according to the written announcement made by the indonesian embassy , 96 indonesia house m@@ aids died when they worked in singapore , among whom some died from jumping off high buildings where they worked .
the indonesian government complains about the incidents of house m@@ aids falling off buildings now and then , and sets many new regulations to control the quality of local indonesian house m@@ aids more strictly and safeguards their security . but the problem remains unresolved and the singapore - indonesia bilateral relationship cannot help being hampered by the house maid issue .
what is deeply puzz@@ ling is that the falling house m@@ aids is more than the casualty of workers on the construction sites , which makes one cannot help thinking deeply about and even investigate the backgrounds and reasons .
chen k@@ ong@@ li , a ren@@ oun@@ ed mainland expert on taiwan issue , published his new book " taiwan observation " recently .
most of articles in the book were written after the first power transfer in taiwan in march 2003 till chen shu@@ ibian put forward the " one side one country " , which are the observation and thinking about the inner situation in taiwan during the period when the mainland is " listening to chen 's remarks and observing his deeds " .
articles written 2 years ago are published now , which shows the complicated and long process of sen@@ sor@@ ship on research works about taiwan in the mainland , and even demonstrate " observing taiwan " does not easily come by .
for a long peri@@ oud of time , chen lik@@ ong has been practical and realistic as well as seeking truth from facts persistently , not confined by and subjective pre - set political frame@@ works and tried to explore unique and penetrating judgement .
reading this book , this feature is even more impres@@ sing .
since the early 1980s , taiwan research has become a " famous school of thought " . various research institutes has appeared and all kinds of scholars and experts shown up and displayed talents .
people in foreign countries generally divide the research institutes in the mainland on taiwan issue into the north school and the south school .
the position of the north school is closer to the official stance with hard remarks . it shows more aggressive and haw@@ k@@ ish color in some given historic peri@@ oud or the process of significant political incidents .
however , the taiwan research institutes of the south school are mainly scattered south of the yang@@ tze river , including shanghai and fu@@ jian .
japanese prime minister jun@@ ichiro ko@@ izumi 's " diploma " that he had studied in london for two years were discovered as exaggeration by the japanese media .
japanese magazine " weekly mail " confirmed with the educational administ@@ ri@@ ve division of the london university that ko@@ izumi just stayed in london for 9 months , seating in several courses as a guest and got no degree either .
this scandal was reported or carried by all kinds of media in china , generally gratifying many fellow chinese .
indeed to our surprise , as the prime minister of a nation , he even make up academic cred@@ ential , deceiving people of his own country .
it is even more dis@@ graceful that the scandal take place in the " imperialist " japan .
however , if we could change to another perspective , we may see some positive side in this scandal .
moreover , these positive factors is just what we lack and is needed to be completed .
in recent years , we constantly advocate " honesty and credibility " , " creation of a sunshine government " , the respect to the " right of information " for the public , and promotion of " transparency " of administration and gov@@ enance . whereas , the status quo is still at distance to the ideal .
think about it . it is not a very big issue that the academic cred@@ ential of the prime minister of a nation is not that genuine , yet it is exposed by the media and chasing and attacking all the way .
in such a country , is there anything that could not be " sunshine " ?
in the taiwan presidential campaign night parties , each camp carries their supporters to the site of campaign by tourist buses . but the recent situation is that the party of the pan - green camp is much less cheer@@ ful than that of the pan - bl@@ us 's .
not long ago , when the taiwan president chen shui - bian was campaigning somewhere in northern taiwan , shouting " elected " , about half of the audience embar@@ assed him by not echo@@ ing . the reason is that most of the local people have relatives doing businesses in the mainland . it worries lots of people that the 3 direct links acc@@ ross the taiwan straight is hung up over and over again , and that the financial policies worked little .
if we disregarded unexpected emergencies , we could suppose that the pan - green would lose , judging of results of public surveys and underground gambling rate during the last days of the taiwan presidential election campaign .
unless there is more explo@@ ding and powerful episodes , chen shui - bian , getting elected with great difficulty if not by lee t@@ eng - hui 's tricks , has already proved his inability to win people 's hearts in the past four years , but exposed corrup@@ cy and base parts ' demonstration of the pan - gre@@ ens instead , by showing themselves up , and thus greatly ham@@ pering the confidence of their supporters .
facing the pan - bl@@ ues that might step into power again , how should beijing respond ?
what should be aware is that the pan - bl@@ ues that might regain the power has not been simply the ku@@ om@@ ing@@ tan 's uni - party camp , but a combination of the pan - bl@@ ues and pan - oranges , which also faces the issue whether the traditional section would integrate with the indigenous section .
the close cooperation currently during the election campaign could not be regarded as the relationship in the future of course .
if elected , the pan - bl@@ ues must integrate from inside for quite a long time , and the following election of the legislature also will prevent lian and so@@ ong administration from drastic changes on the cross straight relations .
unless it real@@ ises that improving the cross straight relations could score for them in the politics inside the island and is confident to make achievements in a short time and im@@ press the taiwan people with these achievements in particular .
based on this background , beijing should put off the reunification promotion moves to make time for lian and so@@ ong to st@@ abl@@ ize inner situation .
more than half a century have passed since the first us nuclear explosion in new m@@ exic@@ o july 1945 and the 2 bombings upon japan in august the same year .
although the arms racing between 2 super powers filed up as much nec@@ l@@ ear weapons as to destroy the whole world , the two sides both realized the danger of nuclear war and avoided pressing the nuclear bo@@ tton .
after the collap@@ sing of the former us@@ s@@ r , the world stepped into the post cold war era and the danger of an all - out nuclear war has basically disp@@ elled .
but at the same time , the danger of nuclear proliferation is not decreased but increased .
this proliferation phen@@ om@@ in@@ om shows in two sides .
first , some countries above the middle level with considerable resources and power try to produce or own nuclear weapons through all sorts of means out of the attempts of regional hegemony , confrontation with neighboring countries , in@@ suring security or diplomatic blackmail .
second , some organizations not formed by countries , especially some isl@@ amic extremist force strongly h@@ ating the west are also trying to get small nuclear weapons at the cost of large casualty of innocent people to hold bloody terrorist attacks against the west .
as a result of such demand , agents and the " nuclear black@@ market " of the sales of nuclear weapons and concerning technologies em@@ ergy as the time requires , and its scale expands day after day , becoming one of the important parts of the nuclear proliferation in the world at present .
as a descend@@ ant of the chinese ancestors , the view of the countryside in jiang@@ nan in the old time still remains in my memory .
back to my hometown after long parted for years , i spotted 3 - storey houses built by farmers themselves here and there in the green fields on both sides of the hu - hang expressway , but seldom saw people working in the fields .
this su@@ prised me very much . it is un@@ believ@@ able that the land and people of my country that i missed in the foreign land could change such much .
but recently , i feel very astonished and shocked when i read some report@@ ages and on - site research works about the situation of the rural areas of china on the internet .
it cannot be believed that there is still such unimaginable dark sides in the rural areas of china and the chinese farmers are still living such humili@@ ated , powerless , miserable and impoverished life .
m@@ r. chen guil@@ i and his wife published a long report@@ age entitled " research on the rural china " after visiting the rural areas in an@@ hui , hen@@ an and he@@ bei , to appeal for farmers and shake the chinese society .
they conclude from vast facts that farmers are oppressed and exploited by corrup@@ ted officials and even killed inno@@ cent@@ ly , " drawing near to chinese farmers , we feel un@@ prec@@ end@@ entedly shock and secret angu@@ ish . we saw un@@ thin@@ kable d@@ esti@@ tu@@ te , un@@ thin@@ kable evils , un@@ thin@@ kable powerless , un@@ thin@@ kable resist@@ ence , un@@ thin@@ kable silence and un@@ thin@@ kable sorrow . "
these are heart - breaking t@@ ear@@ ful words .
it is just as expected , mal@@ ay prime minister ab@@ dul@@ lah bad@@ awi dismissed the parliament and the new parliamentary election will be held soon .
this election will be a very significant event for ab@@ dul@@ lah bad@@ awi , and of landmark importance to the mal@@ ay political situation and development as well .
ab@@ dul@@ lah succeeded ma@@ h@@ ati@@ r as the leader of the nation last november , which was only 4 months ago .
despite it , he still decides to dismiss the parliament and hold the election ahead of time .
it at least implies 2 meanings : first , bad@@ awi is sati@@ fied with his political performance in the past 4 months and is confident enough to the inclination of the voters ; second , he expects to consolidate his power foundation and thus walk out of the shadow of ma@@ h@@ ati@@ r .
doub@@ tlessly bad@@ awi has made a decision like lightning , which indicates that he has already made a complete evaluation of the political condition over the whole country .
the economic conditions of malaysia witness a rather good performance currently , and there is no topic that could be used or speculated by the opposition .
besides , since ab@@ dul@@ lah came into power , he has taken some highly effective measures in sweeping corruption , including arresting and suing those like the former minister of land and cooperative development k@@ as@@ it@@ ah g@@ addam . these measures get applause in some extend and result in optimistic speculation of the public to future anti - corruption actions .
he calls to enhance efficiency of civil service at the same time , which is also an act to boost the public morale .
ever since it was born , the evol@@ v@@ ement and shape of the eu have always been strongly influenced by french politics and culture .
it is the main orientation of the foreign policy of the eu to strive for independence and self - determination in dealing with international affairs , in which a very prominent french characteristic can be seen .
it is just because of this that the international community including china , russia and arab countries hope to see a complete independent force in the international interactions .
we must admit that the foreign policy of the eu has exactly marched to such direction since the late 1980s .
in december 1992 , leaders of all eu countries gathered at the ma@@ a@@ stric@@ ht summit and agreed unanimously to adopt a unified foreign policy and speak to the outside with the same voice .
however , the so - called " unified foreign policy " confronted a complete failure when dealing with the bosnia problem 2 years later .
from the ma@@ a@@ stric@@ ht summit to today , the eu diplomacy for as long as 10 year has little worth displaying .
above all , the eu foreign policy is not able to stand the test of big important events in every way .
different positions of various member countries not only show it but also expose the fatal political defects , i.e . , it is very easy to be divided and ruled by other powers of the world and cracked one by one .
president bush said at the white house on fe@@ b@@ . 24 that he will support the consi@@ titu@@ tion amendment prohibiting homosex@@ ual marriage .
this is an evident change of his ambiguous attitude toward this issue over several months , which represents an important development of the politics in the us election year .
this constitution amendment prohibiting homosex@@ ual marriage is a very powerful political instrument in the new supreme headquarters of the re@@ public@@ ans in southern america , and it also has sweeping negative effects . this hea@@ ve@@ y@@ weight cultural controversy splitting public opinions would certainly intensify the polarization of the us politics and further alien@@ ate the liberal leading east and west coast .
it is a naked example of words differing with deeds to bush himself , who kept on saying he is the one un@@ ifies but not separ@@ ates .
besides , the young us generation are holding a more and more open attitude on the homosex@@ ual issue . bush 's act would damage the long term interests of the re@@ public@@ ans despite the short term gains .
bush 's new " constitution amendment " offensive can be called the " scor@@ ched earth policy " for the presidential election this year .
the reason why bush took up this policy is that he is increasingly weakened on the issues of the war of " counter - terrorism " and economy - unemployment , and has to open a new battle field on the religious and cultural topics that spl@@ its the us internal public opinions of .
the us is still cautious by now .
that is to say , since maintaining the status quo cross the taiwan straight could satisfy long term goal of the us to strategically balance the mainland , the us should avoid political and military conflicts with china resulted from encouraging " taiwan independence " .
it is for@@ se@@ eable that the us is impossible to completely eliminate the room for the " referendum " in taiwan according to beijing 's requests completely , but it could also take some warning acts .
recently , us secretary of state pow@@ ell reiterates the set taiwan policy and clear@@ ify the us stance against " taiwan independence " from his own initiative .
this remark was read by the outside as to confine and prevent chen shui - bian from going too far .
some think tank with official backgrounds in the us made some remarks recently , and the us will dispatch many spy ships to the taiwan straight to spy on the military movements on both sides of the straight . all these indirectly prove that the us is very concerned about the cross - straight situation .
it also shows from another aspect that although the us would not completely listen to beijing 's request to obstruct taiwan 's referendum , but it still is wo@@ or@@ ied by the uncertainty of the taiwan situation at present .
any large scale and two - rival election could result in only one consequence : either chen shui - bian is re - elected , or lien chan re - enter the office of the " taiwan president " .
it is worrying that people from all walks of society in the mainland seem not to mentally prepared for the possibility that chen shui - bian still might get re - elected for lack of information .
if the election were not resulted as what were wished , beijing might go into a passive position unnecessarily .
as an old arab saying goes , " com@@ motion for one days is more fearful than tyr@@ anny for a thousand years . "
is this what the northeast asia countries are worrying about right now ?
i think the answer may be positive .
a prestigious center of research and development funded by the us government close to washington explo@@ res 4 policy alternatives in its recent study , namely engagement , containment , economic s@@ action and pre@@ emptive attack .
attitudes towards these tactics of countries in the region are the focus of the survey .
besides , the survey also analyze the threat imposed by north korea 's nuclear program , according to the possibility of nuclear attacks and possible damages in the eyes of the people of north korea 's neighboring countries , as well as their fears .
china and russia think that the possibility that north korea could use nuclear weapons is small or very small , but japan and south korea rather big .
all northeast asia countries agree to maintain exchanges with north korea .
but japan supports containment , and other countries think that the containment strategy is acceptable under some circumstances as well .
singapore cares about its ranking in the world and attends all sorts of country rankings listed by agencies in europe and america throughout the year .
often coming out to rank ahead , we become more and more interested in the rankings .
however , to rank always first still has many troubles .
ordinary singap@@ ore@@ ans think if they care about ranking too much , they seem to be afraid of being defeated , but if they boast of their rankings , they seem too proud .
so , some people said that we should live a more casual life and it is best that we could stand alo@@ of from the worldly affairs .
since many people dist@@ ained rankings , a very weird phenomen@@ um occurred : people no long regard the " no@@ . 1 of the world " as a good news , and more inclined to think it embar@@ assing .
however , 1 or 2 years passed , things turned around .
we doubt the long term competitiveness of our country and people of all businesses worry about losing their jobs .
having this doubt , we cannot talk so light - hear@@ tedly .
as a result of veh@@ ement international competition , too light - hear@@ tedness could let others catch up with us , and that " everything 's the first place " is every easy to turn into " everything lagging behind " .
apparently , bush is still kind to ch@@ en@@ ey . at the meeting of re@@ public@@ an governors last month , bush vowed that ch@@ en@@ ey was still the only candidate of vice president .
but he still jo@@ ked that he had already entrusted ch@@ en@@ ey to find him a vice president just as in 2000 .
ch@@ en@@ ey , who always keeps low profile , also frequently accepts interviews of media , denying being replaced .
but he still leaves himself a way to back out .
he said he would shrink back from difficulties for health problems or becoming a burden of the president .
ch@@ en@@ ey is 63 years old , and has 4 heart attack records .
recently , it spreads far and wide that us army has besieg@@ ed the 9.@@ 11 master@@ mind os@@ ama , waiting for the right time and going after the easy prey .
the vote of the pres@@ ential election will be on nov@@ . 2 , and it is said that the p@@ ent@@ agon has arranged the big show to catch os@@ ama alive in november .
but a long delay may cause more troubles . by any chance , if os@@ ama escaped , there would be endless troubles for the future .
it looks as if j@@ uli@@ ani may as well be accepted a rather safe tr@@ ump card to win votes for bush .
the 2 rivals in the us presidential election in 2004 has been decided : k@@ erry the democr@@ at vs president bush the re@@ public@@ an .
they has begun warming up exercises as advertisements and campaign debates before the election in november .
they perhaps would cross swords in words upon the 3 major issues as war , economy and society .
bush thinks that war is closely related to us national security , and over@@ throwing s@@ addam and cou@@ tering terrorism with force are both ways to ensure security of us . thus , he keeps on telling the american people , " we are in a war . "
k@@ erry naturally would point out that bush had abused mis@@ information about iraq 's mass destructive weapons and it was wrong to lau@@ ch the iraq war on that basis .
talking about economy , k@@ erry thinks that bush 's tax cut program only benefits the wealthy people but is not able to cre@@ at new jobs .
bush would show k@@ erry : d@@ osen 't the economic statistics keep surging at the moment ?
on the social problems , such as the relationship of the two sexes , bush is against homosex@@ ual marriage , against abortion , and for death penalty , whereas , k@@ erry for abortion and against death penalty , though he is against homosex@@ ual marriage as well .
how bush and k@@ erry would publicize their opinions on the 3 main issues through ads , television and speeches to convince the voters are the political performances they would put on in the coming 8 months .
however , there is more room for k@@ erry to show off on the topic of foreign affairs
according to statistics , young people choose suicide mainly are youngsters between 15 - 19 , and those between 10 - 14 are also account a considerable proportion .
generally speaking , the academic pressure is the major reason , but survey found that emotional problems , especially love affairs and relations with their parents are even the major reason of juvenile suicides .
the pressure of studies and disparity from the expectation are of course belong to the category of the communication between children and their parents .
the pressure of entering higher schools is an un@@ ev@@ itable burden for the local school children in a long time , and in many instances , it is imposed to children by parents .
parents request their children to turn out good academic achievements and compare them with other children from time to time . they ask children to strive for the best , which of course imposes rather hea@@ vey pressure . but the communication behind the pressure is the ther@@ mom@@ eter to measure the gener@@ ational relations .
if the children 's beha@@ v@@ ements do not turn out ideally , and parents sc@@ old or beat them , or blame them silently with dark faces , or even make them think they are disappointing , children would be pushed to a helpless and desperate situation undoubtedly .
it is known that many young students needs psychological treatment are cor@@ nered and mentally obsessed by excessive expectation of their parents .
singapore 's success and rapid development make parents feel that their children own much more superior material conditions than themselves and naturally think their children should be better than themselves .
usually , parents forget that they are not that good in every@@ way when they were young .
to one and a half years old , most of children are sent to boarding nurseries of various companies or government agencies . the government only charge a little bit symbol@@ ically . children only stay at home for one day in a whole month .
nowadays , singapore faces the social issues of a decreasing birth rate and an aging population .
the younger generation is busy in maintain the modern living standard and fashionable material enjoy@@ ments , and has no energy to respond to the call of " early marriage and early child bearing " of the government .
the author has a bold suggestion : the government stands out and accept newly born children .
the singap@@ ore@@ ans only bear children without worrying about bringing them up .
on one hand , the government builds up boarding nurseries and changes primary schools into boarding schools , even providing 3 meals a day but only charging symbol@@ ically that the citizens are able to pay .
this method could not only help resolve the unemployment problem , but also save the troubles of en@@ f@@ ant bonus , increasing maternity leave , hous@@ em@@ aid quality , and tax kick - backs for the government .
what beijing needs to do is not to act as the leading party of the 6 - party talks , but to take precautions and start strategic deployment as soon as possible with a view to china 's long term interest on the korean pen@@ is@@ ula .
to be specific , china should urge north korea to give up nuclear weapons on one hand , and lead the dprk to the road of modernization by reform the kim j@@ ong - il regime , so as to relieve the danger of nuclear war in northeastern asia , maintain the status quo on the korean pen@@ is@@ ula as well as grasp the strategic stake to deal with the us in a long term .
north korea is ferocious in appearance but weak within . it actually long@@ s for economic development and integration into the international community in heart .
this kind of willingness only always shows in tough and unreasonable ways and even totally out of international rules sometimes .
in fact , china has already urged north korea to change its stance not complying with international rules for some time with its influence and economic aids .
but this act need all - round planning .
china 's aid to north korea should not only be constrained to the economic field , but expanded to other fields of the society ; not only urge north korea to give up nuclear plans , but lead it to the road of a modern civilization .
when k@@ erry entered the arena at the beginning , no one expected him to be hot . all attention was on the ex - governor of ver@@ mont , dean .
however , before the party meeting in i@@ ow@@ a , k@@ erry suddenly r@@ ised , winning the preli@@ mil@@ ary election at the party meetings in the 2 most important states , i@@ ow@@ a and new ha@@ mp@@ shire .
in the succeeding preliminary election in the other states , k@@ erry almost never failed . those that were beaten in these states all resulted from the local candidates in these states .
only in 6 weeks , k@@ erry turned into the final candidate from one without a future . all his rivals , including g@@ ep@@ hard@@ t , li@@ e@@ ber@@ man , clar@@ ke , dean and ed@@ wards , were successively defeated , which cannot but make people look at k@@ erry 's political char@@ is@@ ma with a new eye .
in his career as a senator for as long as 19 years , k@@ erry always supports abortion and environmental protection , but opposes tax cut program benefiting the wealthy people . he works on raising the basic salary and wish to solving the problem of global warming .
his working experiences in washington shows his willingness to face difficult social issues , and his courage to challenging the authority , persu@@ ing his value and not afraid of offending the interests of small fr@@ actions of people .
china 's opening up policy began from the rural areas . the rural residents were the first to be benefited .
however , after the 1990s , the economic policy greatly favored cities , which resulted in an almost stagnant rural reform and increasing disparity between rural areas and urban areas .
as time passes , china witnesses two entirely different world : one is the highly prosperous cities , the other poor and backward villages .
as the chinese government says , the growing disparity of rural areas and urban areas is the " problem in development " , which should be resolved by means of sustained development .
that is to say , the development of the coastal regions and cities in china should continue without being en@@ cum@@ bered by the rural problem .
but when small changes take place every year and big changes every 3 years in some cosmopol@@ it@@ ans , people cannot help asking why there wasn 't any changes in some poverty stricken areas in the past scores of years ?
of course , the courses of development of the urban and rural areas are very different as a matter of fact that we should admit . but the problem is while investing a great deal of money into the construction of cities and encourage and support the rich middle class , have the rural population accounting for 70 % of the national total ever been attended and concerned about .
it cannot be denied that each administration of the chinese government have attached great importance to the problem of rural areas and farmers in theory .
yet , throughout all these years , the situation in rural areas has been increasingly difficult and deteriorated , which shows the attention to it has become more and more inadequate .
in any country , the public security , procuratorial and judicial agencies should be the symbol of jus@@ tic and impartiality , as well as the most significant systems safeguarding social stability .
but unfortunately , the public security , procuratorial and judicial agencies in china has become the symbol of corruption .
according to the most recent report of the state auditing administration of china , the result of the auditing to the financial expenses of the public security agencies in 26 provinces and municipalities shows that the irregular sum hits 16.5 billion yuan all over china .
the credibility crisis to the public security , procuratorial and judicial agencies has come into open .
the " liu yong incident " , " sun zh@@ ig@@ ang incident " and the recent " b@@ m@@ w incident " in the he@@ il@@ ong@@ jian province all indicate this deep distrust .
the " b@@ m@@ w incident " is the most typical .
people 's concern about this issue is even far more than that about s@@ ars during the s@@ ars period .
in fact , what people concern about is more than the " b@@ m@@ w incident " itself , but demonstrating their distrust to the whole judicial system .
the related department knew very clearly about it , so they took measures to force out the media .
however , the problem remains .
the second round of the 6 - party talks over the nuclear issue on the korean pen@@ is@@ ula ends with the result generally expected .
during the talks , related parties contacted and pro@@ bed about the peripheral issues of the pen@@ is@@ ula nuclear crisis , and agreed on matters as holding the third round of talks before the end of this june and setting up a working p@@ annel .
however , the talks did not proceed on the essential issues as how north korea should give up its nuclear plans and how the us should ensure the political and mil@@ i@@ atry security of north korea after it gives up nuclear plans and providing north korea with energy aid , etc. , but impressed people with a tighter " deadlock " .
the two major parties - - north korea and the us both did not compromise , and the basic stances of the two sides did not move either .
however , the us showed an at@@ titu@@ te not eager to address the problem noticeably , which showed it deliberately delay the resolution of the problem .
this strategy of the us is closely related to the new development of the current international situation and us interests in these development .
since the fran@@ k@@ lin ro@@ os@@ evel@@ t administration , there have not been so many company chiefs being imprisoned .
is this simply co@@ incidents or the public and investors cannot tolerate the business crime and other illegal deeds any more , which leads to these crimes all were revealed recently ?
the answer may not be simple , but it is true that many business crimes were revealed recently .
this is a good sign for economic recovery and restoration of the investment confidence .
the end of 1990s might be the most confusing and puzz@@ ling period of the us business history . the sooner its impact dis@@ appears the better .
after the dust falls , the names of some companies must fade out into history and only can be found in the text books of business schools .
but some other businesses , such as ty@@ co and mc@@ i , will try to welcome the new round upsurge of economic growth under the leadership of new managerial teams .
when will the new round of ec@@ nom@@ ic growth come ?
as a ce@@ o , you might have no answer .
but it doesn 't matter , for even the chairman of the us federal reserve green@@ span does not know the answer .
the bush administration wants to use the key@@ nes@@ ian theory to stimulate economic growth , expanding expenses , especially on national defense , on one hand , and largely cutting taxes on the other .
in the international commercial arena , the bush administration continues to promote free trade , while its trade deficit has hit a new high of 5@@ 49 billion us dollars .
with the large scale tax cut , investment and consumption do not see notable growth .
as the point of views of the neo - key@@ nes@@ ians represented by w@@ yn@@ ne god@@ ley , the famous british economist , the us economy has been trapped and the financial strategy of bush cannot do much about it .
they think , the so - called " market rule coming first " is only a kind of illusion , which must result in minority gaining and the majority losing .
people used to think that the benefited minority are all in the us internationally and the majority in disadvantage are all in developing countries .
now , it is not the case .
many us economists think that the winners in globalization include the multin@@ ation@@ als head@@ qu@@ at@@ ered in us as well as india and china , which are in prominent position .
india occupies the service field , while china the manufacture field .
people all attracted by the phenomenon that us investment and productive equipment are transf@@ ered in large quantity to china , but ignored china 's advantage of a high quality but low payment labor market .
first , is the current taiwan political situation expected by beijing or not ?
how beijing ass@@ esses the situation is only known by itself , but the result of its assessment could be analyzed through apparent phenomenon .
for the past 4 years , chen shui - bian and an@@ net lu 's " in@@ dep@@ ent camp " showed sharp - cut remarks and swift acts , actively proceeding toward " taiwan independence " .
in contrast , beijing spoke out low@@ dly only once in a while with a routine attitude , seemingly indifferent to the " taiwan independent " evol@@ v@@ ement .
but since last autumn , beijing 's attitude suddenly turn around , like an ox@@ cart suddenly turning into a car . it is getting obvious in recent months and the ability of disposal widely different from that in the 1990s .
it can be deduc@@ ed from this that the current taiwan political situation is in beijing 's calculation .
secondly , the foreign policy involving taiwan is also what should be taken into consideration .
the evol@@ v@@ ement of the cross straight situation mainly depends on whether the attitude of major powers in the world are closer to beijing or to tai@@ pei .
the answer is very clear , for the attitudes of all countries are open and apparent .
by now , other countries are getting closer to beijing with more inter@@ sections in specific policies and views , while farther to tai@@ pei with less consensus . moreover , " gentle but sincere " advice was expressed to the taiwan democracy that has always been praised .
