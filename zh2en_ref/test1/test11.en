the officials said the study was conducted before the three most recent attacks this month , but those incidents can only reinforce the report 's findings .
the study aimed at identifying ways to help pilots evade attacks by ira@@ qi guerr@@ illas using this kind of weapons but the officials did not elaborate on any new discovery .
judging from the methodology used in the new wave of attack , it is certainly disturbing because it appears the ira@@ qi guerr@@ illas have already studied the fighting tactics of u@@ .@@ s . aircrafts carefully .
the research team has found the ira@@ qi insurg@@ ents used an sa@@ -@@ 16 shoulder - fired missile in more than one occasion , which is especially worrying .
this type of missile has a sophisticated guidance system that is harder for pilots to th@@ wart .
a senior army avi@@ ator in the per@@ sian gulf region said , " the enemy enjoys a strategic success each time one of our aircraft is shot down .
it becomes a major media event and the defeat or victory is decided immediately . therefore , the enemy sees this tactics as very useful . "
since october 25 last year , nine military helicopters have been shot down or have crashed , killing at least 49 u@@ .@@ s . soldiers .
car@@ ter praised dean on eve of democratic i@@ ow@@ a caucus
( ag@@ ence france - pres@@ se , plains , ge@@ or@@ gia , 18th ) - former u@@ .@@ s . president car@@ ter praised democratic presidential candidate dean , a former ver@@ mont governor , for his " courageous and out@@ spoken " opposition to the iraq war on the eve of the i@@ ow@@ a caucus
" i have been particularly grateful at the courageous and out@@ spoken posture and position that governor dean has taken from the beginning , " car@@ ter told reporters in his hometown , ge@@ or@@ gia plains .
the no@@ bel peace prize lau@@ re@@ ate said , " in the last year and a half , i have spent a lot of time strongly opposing the completely unnecessary and unjust war in iraq .
despite my strong efforts , the war commenced and now has proven to be , not only based on erroneous information and misleading statements , but also a sustained demonstration of tragedy . "
car@@ ter praised dean as a strong " advocate of peace " . his statements fell short of a formal endorsement , but u@@ .@@ s . televisions broadc@@ asted car@@ ter 's remarks .
as a left - leaning former governor of a northern state , dean could be at a disadvantageous position when he faces clar@@ k , a retired general and a centr@@ ist from ar@@ k@@ ans@@ as . however , car@@ ter 's support could boost dean 's chances in the more conservative , religion - conscious southern states .
car@@ ter said in a recent television interview that he saw dean as the most likely democratic candidate to go against bush .

taiwan and japan are both democratic countries . both have the obligation and , even more , the responsibility to jointly strive for democracy in asia .
in order to propagate the value of democracy , our government will establish the " taiwan foundation for democracy " in the near future and one of its important jobs is to cooperate with other political parties in foreign countries .
through this fund , the democratic progressive party wishes to work hand - in - hand with other democratic parties in the world and shares its experience in democratic development with them . we wish to contribute to peace , stability and prosperity in asia . we hope the dream of a " democratic alliance in asia " can be realized at an early date .
international situations are varying from minute to minute these days . the rise and fall of one force in the region may affect the whole situation and could put the safety of other countries to test .
in the asia pacific region , north korea , embraced with its nuclear power , had test - fired several missiles since u@@ .@@ s . started its war on iraq last month . the missiles flew over the territorial air space of japan . furthermore , china has been actively expanding its military strength for quite some time and deployed missiles directly aimed at taiwan .
all these moves have become a serious safety threat to taiwan , japan and the asia pacific region .
this is an issue about strengthening of democracy as well as security and protection . therefore , it needs a formal security mechanism before it can be fully discussed and resolved .
in today 's meeting , the democratic progressive party , as the ruling party in taiwan , is holding an official dialogue with japan 's ruling party , the liberal democratic party , and other legislators from other parties for the first time on the issue of security . its importance goes without saying that .
apart from bilateral dialogue between taiwan and japan , i personally hope that u@@ .@@ s . , japan , south korea and other pacific ri@@ m countries can cooperate to promote the establishment of a " safety and security dialogue mechanism " in the future and support taiwan 's participation in multi - lateral dialogue organizations in the region in order to implement the spirit of " cooperative security " .
today is an important moment inspiring our further advancement in the route of reforms . we have to give our greatest appreciation to all comrades in our party for their support to the party 's will@@ power and made joint efforts to achieve our reform objective .
" political party 's withdrawal from mass media " is the most fundamental requirement for the implementation of a media reform . the democratic progressive party has always insisted on the concept that ruling can only accelerate the speed of reform but not an obstruction or burden .
to promote this reform objective , we also know that all comrades in our party with a pu@@ b@@ ic position have to take lead and withdraw from media operations . however , that is only a tiny step in the media reform but it is also a critical step .
during the martial law era , the mass media was monopolized and many comrades in the party have fought to open up public opinion in media . they have committed themselves to difficult tasks of organizing the fourth station and other local radio stations etc. they hoped to use these methods to break through the restrictions at that time and provide more momentum for redevelopment of the media environment .
for example , in order to foster the creation of the fourth television station at that time , comrade tr@@ ong c@@ hai has put forth a large amount of painstaking efforts and finally the " form@@ os@@ a television " was born .
his move has a significant impact to the media environment , especially the break - up of the long - time monopoly of the three stations , and created more space for the expansion of the cable television industry .
in our process of promoting reforms , we must understand that there are many things we have no choice but to do because of restrictions in history and environment . as the mass media is completely free and opened today , it signifies that our mission in this phase is completed . to enable the reform process to continue moving forward , it is necessary for us to make selection and sacrifice .
the central standing committee has announced that all comrades with a public position must withdraw from media operation before the next legislative session , that is september 5th , in order to set a good example and fulfill the party 's undertaking to the people .
we are gratified that everyone has taken full consideration of the party 's ideal and objective . comrades who have made many contributions in the democratic movements , including tr@@ ong c@@ hai , chang chun - hung , chou ching - yu , hou shui - sheng , kao meng - ting , h@@ wang na@@ e - hui and sung min - kong etc. , have sacrificed their self interest and attach most importance to the promotion of media reform .
to govern is not to enjoy power , but rather to embrace responsibility .
the democratic progressive party might have encountered obstacles and setbacks in its governing process . but , we have always been able to turn challenges into momentum for moving forward , leading taiwan firmly and safely in its efforts for advancing into total democracy and connecting itself with the universal values of democracy , peace , and prosperity .
because we have always believed that people are the masters of our country . the democratic progressive party 's responsibility is to elevate its founding spirit of " clean government , conscientious rule , and love for the homeland " to a bright vision of " reforms , progress , and a good life , " laying a foundation of long term peace and stability for the 23 million tai@@ w@@ anese .
for a long time , the democratic progressive party acted as the " government 's delegate " in efforts to expand taiwan 's diplomacy and has attained admirable results .
despite communist china 's continual suppression , we have not retreated because destiny is in our hands . notwithstanding our lack of boun@@ tiful resources , the democratic progressive party has , step - by - step , helped taiwan expand its international participation and visibility .
" multilateral diplomacy " is the main axis of the democratic progressive party 's diplomatic strategy . in the past year , we have successfully used the " council on asian liber@@ als and democrats " as a platform to exchange views with other countries and political parties in the region . we shared our experiences with them on a range of issues , including economic challenges in east asia , democratic reforms within a political party , the removal of money politics , resolutions for problems related to globalization and poverty , political propaganda and communications , and youth participation in politics etc.
next march , i will formally assume the chair of the " council on asian liber@@ als and democrats " . i hope to use the position as a leader of an international organization to find more opportunities for taiwan to contribute to the international community .
in addition , the democratic progressive party has actively participated in the activities of the " liberal international " since it became a formal member last year .
apart from sending a human rights commissioner to be stationed at the secretariat of liberal international 's london headquarters , we will cooperate with other member parties on political reform forums to be held in various locations in central america , south america and europe etc.
september 28 marked our party 's sevent@@ eenth anniversary .
the sevent@@ een - year - old democratic progressive party has always adhered to its democratic ideals , full of energy in reform and progress .
we have won the trust of tai@@ w@@ anese people because we always stand on the side of democracy and reform . for the same reason , we are going to bear stern@@ er and more important responsibility and mandate in the future .
three years ago , we took over the burden as a governing party . at that time , the previous administration had already circu@@ it@@ ously amended the constitution six times in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
the issue of complete re - election of the legislature was addressed in 1991 , provisions for direct presidential elections were inst@@ ated in 1994 , revisions in 1997 frozen the organization of the provincial government , and the national assembly was turned into a non - standing body in 2000 . this tor@@ tuous process of constitution amendment is the path taken by the people of taiwan to strengthen our country 's sovereignty and democratic legitimacy
if we take the 1996 direct presidential election as the most important symbol that taiwan has become an independent democratic sovereignty , then this '@@ complete ' nation will be ten years old by 2006 .
after putting democracy into practice for a decade , we must consider , as an independent democratic sovereignty , what will we pursue in our next step ?
i must say the next phase should be deepening of our democracy and work towards a more efficient constitutional framework . this can lead the people of taiwan to meet the rigorous challenges in the new century .
asia is the largest continent on earth , with nearly 30 percent of the world land area and about 60 percent of the world population at this moment . its economic activities accounted for one quarter of the world 's total . it should and it could make remarkable contribution to world peace and development .
asia has a time - honored and glorious culture . the valleys of yellow river , yang@@ tze river , indu@@ s river , gang@@ es river , the e@@ uph@@ rates and the ti@@ gr@@ is are all known as crad@@ les of human civilization .
in its lengthy progress through history , the people of asia have composed res@@ pl@@ endent pages and chapters on human civilization development .
in recent generations , asia has experienced many suffering and vic@@ is@@ sit@@ udes of life . the people of different nations stri@@ ved for liberation , sought development and made un@@ tiring efforts before asia attained some enormous achievements .
but , to realize a new up - rise and revitalization of asia , there is still a long way to go .
asia needs better cooperation and should encourage development in order to achieve a win - win situation . this is the only route to a new up - rise and revitalization of asia , which is also in the fundamental interest of all people in asia .
given new situations in the new century , asian developments are facing new opportunities .
peace and development is still theme of our era . an overall peaceful environment among nations has provided a favorable external condition for asian development .
as globalization intensi@@ fies and technology revolution advances by leaps and bounds around the world , the optimization or reorganization of essential production factors and the transformation of industries in international markets have accelerated , which is beneficial for asian countries to make better use of international capitals , to import advance technology , to explore new international markets and finally stimulate local economic developments .
asia has abundant resources and possesses a vast market . it is also a region with the best economic vitality in our world . its development potential is huge .
lots of people , but not developed . these are the two crucial national conditions of china .
china has a population of 1.3 billion . no matter how small a problem may be , it becomes a big problem when it is multiplied by 1.3 billion . no matter how siz@@ able finances or resources may appear to be , they become a very low average when divided by 1.3 billion .
this is what a chinese leader must keep firmly in mind at all times .
to solve the 1.3 - billion - population problem , we cannot depend on others but only on ourselves .
since the founding of the people 's republic of china , we have attained significant achievements in our development , but we also took some winding courses and lost some valuable opportunities .
since the reform and opening in 1978 , we have finally found a correct path for our own development .
and this is : the people of china have to build their own socialism with chinese characteristics independently .
the essence of this path is to mobilize all positive factors , liberate and develop production capability , respect and protect the chinese people 's freedom to pursue happiness and well - being .
china 's reform and opening have covered rural villages to cities , from economic issues to political , cultural and social areas .
as we move step by step deeper into this process , the bottom - line is always to let vitality in labor , know - how , technology , management and capital to burst forth without restraint , enabling all resources for creation of social wealth to flow smoothly .
in recent years , the world has undergone profound changes . science and technology advance with each passing day and productivity in our world is rising unceasingly . world markets are kn@@ itted together more closely than before creating unprecedented development opportunities for all nations .
however , it is worthwhile to note that problems of power politics , regional conflicts , terrorism , contagious diseases and environmental contamination are still threatening the stability and development of our world .
the negative impacts of globalization elevate the risk and price of economic and social developments in developing countries . in fact , some developing countries are facing the risk of being margin@@ alized .
at present , the world is stil@@ ling facing many uncertainties notwithstanding a gradual recovery in the global economy .
the setback of multilateral trade negotiations in the do@@ ha round and complicated factors like protectionism etc. have increased the difficulties in developing countries .
but , it is gratified to note the vast majority of developing nations are enthusiastic for making progress , with keen determination for reform and are willing to contribute great efforts to build a strong state . as a result , they have achieved excellent accomplishments that everyone ga@@ zes at .
in the international stage , developing countries rely on the non - aligned movement , group of 77 etc. as support and have strengthened their alliance and cooperation . they have made important contributions to protect their own legitimate rights and changed unreasonable international order in politics and economy . their efforts become important forces to democr@@ ati@@ ze international relations .
meanwhile , communication and cooperation between developing countries have also achieved fruitful results , elev@@ ating economic dealings and contacts among themselves .
from the and@@ es to me@@ kong river@@ side , from the union of arab mag@@ h@@ re@@ b to the formation of african union and the south - south cooperation - - no matter it is content to formality , mechanism to measures , everything has been improved , enriched and updated .
in the past year , the friendly cooperation between china and canada has continued to develop on all fronts .
trading between the two nations continues to grow and total trades amounted to nearly ten billion u@@ .@@ s . dollars .
frequent high - level contacts continue . canada 's ministers for foreign affairs , national defense , environment and international cooperation as well as other important politicians have visited china in succession . senior chinese officials , including the chief justice of supreme court and minister of commerce , have also visited canada one after the other . more important , the prime ministers of two nations also visited each other .
premier wen ji@@ abao 's recent visit to canada has the significance of hon@@ oring the past and striving for a better future . the visit injected new vitality to the further development of sino - canada relation and has laid a solid foundation for a wider and deeper friendly cooperation between the two countries in many areas .
china and canada will continue to strengthen the cooperation between the two nations in areas like politics , economy , education , culture and technology etc. , striving for the target of doubling the bilateral trades by 2010 .
dear compatriots , dear friends .
notwithstanding you are living in an overseas country , your hearts are always tied to the homeland . you have followed with interest the developments in the mother country . in every critical juncture , you are always sharing the worries or joys of the people of your mother country . in fact , your pul@@ ses are beating together with the mother country .
last year , some areas in china were affected by s@@ ars and flooding . you people have expressed your heartfelt concerns and blessing to the people of the mother country in various ways , including the internet , letters , telephone and donations etc. the different circles in the chinese community have organized several large scale fund raising and charitable entertainment events . when the " shen@@ zhou 5 " manned space program achieved great success , numerous congratulatory messages , letters and cards were received from you people . everyone is so proud , el@@ ated and inspired by china 's achievements in space technology .
during premier wen 's visit in canada , hundreds of compatriots living here together with chinese students studying in canada welcomed the premier at the airport and at the parliament hill , despite the wind , rain and severe cold , creating so many touching and moving moments .
here , i wish to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to you . in the new year , i trust all of you will continue to make new contributions for a thriving and prosperous china , for developments of sino - canada relation , for total unification of china and for an all - round revival of china .
first , it is important to strengthen our mutual political trust and deep@@ ens our strategic alliance .
china and france are both permanent members of united nations security council and both have important influence to international affairs .
both countries are in favor of multi - polarization in our world . both advocate the preservation of author@@ it@@ ativeness of un@@ tied nations . both are willing to promote the establishment of new international order in politics and economies according to wishes of all people over our world .
both countries share many common con@@ sensu@@ ses and common interests in dealing with different challenges facing mankind as well as in the proper handling of important international affairs etc.
china is willing to reinforce consultation and dialogue with france on important issues such as anti - terrorism , anti - proliferation , curb on international crime , promotion of mutual development and strengthening of united nations ' role etc. china is willing to cooperate closely with france and strives for protection of world peace and the promotion of common prosperity .
second , it is important to strengthen economic cooperation for mutual benefits and to complement each other .
china is the largest developing country in the world amid the process of an all - out development and modernization , and hence , it possesses vast market potential .
france is a developed country at the forefront of economic , scientific and technological development in our world and possesses advanced technologies in many fields .
the economies of our two countries are strongly complementary to each other and there are lots of opportunities for economic and trading cooperation .
since the founding of new china , the chinese government has always attached high importance to the development of african relation and adopted a series of guiding principles and policies .
all along , we have adhered to the five principles of peaceful coexistence . we respect the independent choices made by african countries for their political systems and development routes . we have provided assistance to african countries within our best capability and started economic and technical cooperation with them . we support cooperation among african countries and their united efforts to improve themselves . we have asked international community to attach more importance to peace and development in africa and , at the same time , we also support african countries ' participation in international affairs with equal standing . we have strengthened our consultation and cooperation with africa and made joint efforts to safeguard the rights and interests of developing countries .
china - africa friendship has a very long history and is deeply rooted in the hearts of our people .
since the founding of new china , we have always firmly supported the cause of national liberation in africa and extended our sincere support to help develop national economies in african countries .
we have dispatched chinese experts , doctors , teachers and workers to work side by side with local people in africa , get along well with them , and are attached to each other like brothers .
in international affairs , china and african countries understand each other , support each other and become partners to be counted on .
the chinese people will never forget the strong support by the vast number of developing countries , including those in africa , without which china could not successfully regain its lawful seat in the united nations at the 26th session of the united nations general assembly in 1971 .
the political trust between china and africa at various levels and among different officials has deepened in recent years . trade and economic cooperation become more fruitful . friendly associations in culture , education , health care , science , technology and sports developed vigorously . the forum on china - africa cooperation launched at the beginning of the century has become a new platform for closer china - africa relation and stronger cooperation .
china and africa have set out to establish a new type of partnership for long - term stability , equality and mutual benefits . china - africa friendship and cooperation have entered a new stage of all - round development .
seven years after ni@@ xon visited china and the sino - u@@ .@@ s . joint communique in shanghai , the car@@ ter administration finally accepted china 's stance on the taiwan issue and the two countries successfully established diplomatic relation .
this event and deng xia@@ oping 's successful visit to u@@ .@@ s . started a new chapter in sino - u@@ .@@ s . relation .
when re@@ agan first assumed office , china and u@@ .@@ s . had some intense arguments about the taiwan problem .
after difficult negotiations , the two governments announced the " august 17 " communique in 1982 and agreed to solve the taiwan weapon sales problem by steps .
the shanghai communique , sino - u@@ .@@ s . diplomatic relation communique and the " august 17 " communique have collectively formed the political foundation for sino - u@@ .@@ s . relation .
after the establishment of diplomatic relation for 10 years , the overall sino - u@@ .@@ s . relation is stable notwithstanding the two countries still have some struggle over the taiwan issue from time to time . association and cooperation in many areas are increasing day by day .
in the eighties and early n@@ ine@@ ties of the twentieth century , dramatic changes took place in eastern europe . on disintegration of soviet union and ending of the cold war , international situation has taken the greatest change since world war ii .
u@@ .@@ s . took the lead to sanction china and announced the sale of 150 f@@ -@@ 16 fighters to taiwan . u@@ .@@ s . linked the human right issue with the most favored nation status and allowed lee t@@ eng - hui to visit america . the sino - u@@ .@@ s . relation sank to a low point .
as china 's economy started to grow rapidly , china 's international position has risen gradually .
more and more americ@@ ans began to recognize the improvement and development of sino - u@@ .@@ s . relation is in the fundamental interest of united states and china .
six months ago , it was also in this hall that we successfully started the six - party talks and established the direction to solve the nuclear problem peacefully .
during the past six months , different sides have commenced ongoing dialogue and discussions . in order to hold a new round of talks , a lot of work was done and in - depth preparation has been made . through this process , we have improved the understanding of each other 's stands .
now , all sides expect to discuss specific issues in the second round talks and are looking forward to achieve concrete results . we all believe our concerns can be resolved through coordinated and concerted steps . we all hope that the peace process established by the six - party talks can continue .
these are the important foundation for our talks today .
the important meaning of the second round talks is to start discussion on specific problems and it also symbolizes the peace process has stri@@ d@@ den another step forward .
this round of talks will touch on how to set up specific targets to solve the nuclear problem , explore first phase measures for solving the nuclear problem and study ways to continue the talks .
as the talks deepen , we may have to respond to other difficulties and face more challenges . however , this is our job endowed by history and expectations given to us by international community .
the six parties gathering here are representing the strong political desire for peace by the people and government in the six countries .
our talks are to enlarge common con@@ sensu@@ ses . it is not for highlighting discrepancy . it is for solving problems but not for ag@@ itating contradictions .
china believes all sides have now recognized the peace mission that we are shouldering . we have to adopt a constructive attitude , cooperative and tolerant spirit , respect each other and show flexibility in order to narrow our differences .
the second round of six - party talks in beijing has finished the pre - set agenda after three days of discussion .
i wish to thank the representatives and heads of delegations , their governments , and all workers for their contribution in this meeting .
if we say the first round of talks has established the main objective of den@@ u@@ clear@@ ization in the korean peninsula , then the meaning of this round of talks is to proceed with specific dialogue and takes a new step forward to the main objective .
in the meeting , all sides have carried out in depth and constructive discussions . all sides have used their wisdom and explored rationally the methods and steps necessary for solving the problem . useful tentative ideas have been brought up by different sides , which positively indicated their own policies .
the meeting has achieved a series of useful results . in particular , consensus has been reached for the next round of meeting and the set - up of a work group . hence , the meeting has an important meaning in pushing ahead with the peace process .
dear colleague : peace and development are the theme of our mighty era .
ladies and gentlemen , you are representing the people of the six nations and their needs , desire and ad@@ oration for peace . in fact , people everywhere in the world need peace , desire for peace and ad@@ ore peace .
in the past three days , international community is watching beijing , looking attentively at di@@ aoy@@ utai and has placed high hope on this round of talks .
perhaps some people may think the results of the talks are not enough or the progress is not fast enough .
the way i see it is that this round of talks was started under a situation where the related parties were lack of trust and differences in their stands were widening .
the chinese government 's stand on the taiwan issue is always consistent and that is , it insists on the fundamental guiding principle of " peaceful reunification ; one country , two systems " .
for this , we have tried our greatest efforts and showed our best sincerity . we have actually done a lot of work .
however , the taiwan administration and the forces promoting " taiwan independence " are challenging our efforts .
we respect taiwan people 's request for democracy , but we oppose any attempt by the taiwan administration and the forces for " taiwan independence " to organize " taiwan independence " activities under disguise of democracy . we oppose any separation of taiwan from the motherland .
we want to protect the peace and stability in the taiwan strait region and that is why we have to clearly state our determination and our will@@ power to maintain the unification of the motherland .
we have already said that we will try our best efforts to realize a reunification of the motherland in a peaceful way as long as a gl@@ eam of hope remains .
we appreciate president bush 's re@@ it@@ eration of the one china stance , which sends a clear signal to the " taiwan independence " forces .
the taiwan leadership claimed that " for the sake of preventing a military invasion by china and unilaterally change the current status across the strait , it is necessary to set into action the march 20 peace referendum " .
this is de@@ fam@@ ation to mainland china 's peace efforts and provo@@ kes the relation between the two sides of the strait .
at present , the real threat to taiwan safety does not come from the mainland but origin@@ ates from taiwan administration 's active pursuit of separation activities in name of " taiwan independence " .
the " taiwan independence " separation force is the direct cause of damage to current relation between two sides of the strait and endang@@ ers the peaceful situation in taiwan strait .
the taiwan administration has twisted mainland 's opposition to separation by " taiwan independence " and mainland 's desire to maintain stability in taiwan strait as a suppression of democracy and freedom in taiwan . taiwan has used such an excuse to start the referendum .
this is really to make something out of nothing , put right and wrong the other way round . the taiwan administration is attempting to obtain sympathy and support by cheating such as to continue pushing forward its separation route .
the taiwan administration asserts that they are holding a so - called " preventive referendum " or " peace referendum " . no matter how it is to be packaged , this kind of provocation can only cause confrontation and hostility , escalating the intense relation between the two sides of the strait , and push the relation between two sides of the strait to the edge of danger .
taiwan is proceeding in a totally opposite direction with taiwan compatriots ' mainstream public opinion for peace , stability and development . this is not deepening the taiwan " democracy " but mislead and manipulate the people of taiwan . it is also a serious threat to the peace and stability of asia pacific region and , as such , will receive widespread opposition from compatriots in two sides of the strait as well as the international community .
an overview of progress and development of the chinese race in history tells us that unification is always the mainstream , irresistible general trend and the feelings of the people .
as the motherland grows stronger everyday and cooperation between the two sides of the strait strengthen unceasingly , international community 's acceptance of one china has been further reinforced . any plot for separation is destined to fail .
the chinese new year has been one of the traditional festivals highly valued by the chinese people and by now , it is only slightly more than 2 weeks away .
in these bustling and joyful days , we are accustomed to gather together with relatives and best friends and exchange gifts to express our wishes .
in accordance with the spirit of " linking people ; delivering business " , hong kong post starts to provide " hong kong / mainland gift fulfillment service " in collaboration with china post , which can help hong kong citizens to send their wishes and blessings to friends and relatives in hong kong or mainland china during the spring festival period .
for a long time , hong kong post is devoted to cooperate with other postal institutions to provide international fulfillment services .
since december 2002 , hong kong post has cooperated with australia post to launch a fulfillment service for western w@@ ines , which provides premium products to hong kong citizens .
this time , we are in collaboration with china post , elev@@ ating the existing close cooperation in postal services , postal money order , and couri@@ er etc. to the cross border fulfillment service . directed at the increasing market demand by hong kong citizens to send gifts to relatives , friends and clients in mainland , we have launched this " hong kong / mainland gift fulfillment service " .
the first batch of gifts includes several nic@@ ely packed gift sets for the chinese new year . the gift sets include sel@@ ections of can@@ dies and nuts , te@@ al@@ eaves , dried seafood etc. and have a wide range of prices to suit your needs .
they are very elegant gifts ; no matter you are sending them to relatives , friends or business partners .
as we can all see , the consumer council has made many contributions to protect the rights of consumers over the past 30 years .
if we want to evaluate the achievements of the consumer council , the best measure would be a check on any real improvement in consumer rights .
i totally agree with what chairman chan has just said - - after 30 years , the consumers not only fully understand their rights now but all walks of life in our community have attached importance to consumer rights . this is clearly the fruitful result of efforts by consumer council and the government .
the consumer council conducts regular testing on products and performs market research on products or services . it also studies the operations of various trades and professions . the council publishes fair and objective market information through its monthly magazine , the " choice " .
the public has a lot of faith in the " choice " monthly magazine and the council is now working on a web version . this will enhance the magazine 's function and help consumer to acquire more up - to - date market information .
the council has eleven regional consumer counsel centers and sixteen hotlines , which provide information on goods and services as well as accepting complaints from consumers .
since the founding of the consumer council , it has received an ever - increasing numbers of inquiries - from several thousands cases at the time when it was established in the seventies to the 14@@ 6,000 cases last year , an increase of twenty fol@@ ds . that indicates more and more consumers refer to the council 's reports and opinions before choosing products and services
furthermore , the consumer council has already processed more than 26@@ ,000 cases of complaints this year .
the consumer council also publishes name of shops that employ improper g@@ im@@ mic@@ ks in their business . this can help consumers to watch out and not to be fooled . at the same time , it can also caution operators .
legislator y@@ eung , i told you before i have watched the television every carefully at the time of july 1 . i have done a lot of intro@@ spec@@ tion thereafter . i can see citizens have demands , resentment and are not satisfied with the government 's policy .
in this area , the government and i have stri@@ ved to improve over the past six and seven months . we can see citizens are demanding the government to do a good job with the problems in the economy or people 's livelihood and we have made a lot of efforts in these areas . we also understand our citizens have many opinions against section 23 of the " basic law " and therefore , we have withdrawn section 23 . in fact , the government has made an inst@@ ant@@ aneous response .
as to the demands for democracy in our society , i also understand it clearly .
however , legislator y@@ eung , i wish to tell you what i am doing today is to ensure every matter can proceed smoothly after the political review starts . therefore , we have to solve some basic problems first and this is a different thing all together .
what are the basic problems ?
some are problems of principle and some are problems in law . when the relevant rules in the political review involve the " basic law " , there will be wh@@ ys and where@@ fo@@ res in interpretation . hence , it is necessary to do a good job in this area .
we are doing this part of work and a three - men team has already commenced work .
they will hold counsel with the central government and also listen to everyone 's opinion in hong kong . i think this is a good step and is a decision we arrived at after giving serious consideration to opinions in hong kong society .
in today 's highly competitive commercial environment , brand name plays a crucial function to make products successful .
to create a famous brand name , it is not a task that can be done in one morning or evening . it needs original design , high quality , thoughtful packaging , effective marketing and sustained investment .
hong kong possesses the conditions to create famous brands .
we possess the related know - how , technique and experience . we have a wealth of talents in everything from design , manufacture and marketing , right up to management . we also have access to a vast market .
cep@@ a became effective recently and will further enhance our advantage . apart from zero tariffs for exporting goods into mainland market , the best part of it is to stimulate merchants to think more and work hard to increase the value added in our products . such that our products can become famous brands ad@@ ored by consumers in hong kong , mainland and even the whole world .
cep@@ a gives an impetus to hong kong products for migr@@ ating to the high value added path and , in this sense , the " hong kong top ten brand names awards " organized by chinese manufacturers ' association of hong kong happens to have the same idea by coincidence .
in the past five - year , the awards have delivered fif@@ ty-@@ one " hong kong top ten brand names " .
nevertheless , fif@@ ty-@@ one brand names are really nothing in view of the vast market in mainland . we need to have hundreds , thousands or even more " hong kong top brand names " .
for many years , hong kong 's mass transit railway corporation has actively participated in various subway projects in major cities of the mainland and introduced their rich experience gained in hong kong to the mainland market in form of professional services .
i am glad to note that the quality of hong kong 's investment , professional service and management skills are positively accepted in the mainland market .
this type of exchange between shenzhen and hong kong will not only help develop our mother country but also create more development opportunities for hong kong merchants . in addition to the stimulation of the economy , it can help provide more employment opportunities in hong kong .
we have to thank the central government and shenzhen special economic zone government for their policy supports in many areas , without which we cannot possibly reach an agreement in principle for this project .
this is the first investment outside hong kong for mass transit railway corporation . the participation in mainland subway development in form of an investment can help introduce more hong kong brand names to the mainland , which is obviously a delighted event to hong kong citizens and compatriots in mainland .
i wish here that the shenzhen metr@@ o line 4 would receive a speedy official approval from central government and everything is smooth with the project 's engineering work . this event has laid a stronger foundation for more communication and cooperation between the two places of shenzhen and hong kong in the future .
today is the fifth day of the lunar new year , i am very glad to be invited by the chinese gold & silver exchange to join your lunar new year gathering and preside the market reopen ceremony for the new year .
first of all , i wish everyone a happy lunar new year . may everyone have the spirit of the dragon and the horse . may time have moved in your favor . may fortunes find their way to you and may all things that your heart desires come true .
in the past one year , the price of gold surged significantly and has recently broken through the barrier of us $ 400 an ounce . the strong trend reflects that investors have regained confidence in gold .
i believe your line of business was very busy in the past year .
in fact , apart from external factors , the flourishing market also reflects the fruit of hard work by the chinese gold & silver exchange in past 90 years or so .
this endeavor laid a solid foundation stone for hong kong 's gold market and has made numerous contributions to strengthen hong kong 's position as an international financial center .
people say " the whole year 's work depends on a good start in spring " . i hope the members of chinese gold & silver exchange will continue with their hard work in the coming year and grasp the " golden " time for the gold and silver industry . it is also important to grasp the demand on gold trading brought forth by the reform in mainland gold market , our country 's accession to world trade organization and cep@@ a . i hope everyone can continue to push ahead the development of the market .
i believe with the active promotion by members of the exchange , the gold market in hong kong can show an extraordinary splendor in the coming year .
finally , i wish an active trading in the gold market in the year of the monkey . all businesses can flourish and thrive .
thank you ladies and gentlemen .
nevertheless , past challenges are not limited to subsidized public housing . private housing is also full of serious or@@ deals .
the outbreak of 1997 financial crisis has burst the asset bubble , causing property price to fall by 70 percent . property owners are hard hit , which was actually the main cause for the accelerated deflation in the past five years .
the economy is turning good now and we are determined to maintain a stable environment to ensure steady development in our property market .
a healthy property market is indeed important to a full recovery in hong kong economy .
we are also committed to protect and improve our living environment .
our work down the road is based on the principle of sustainable development . we will adopt better city planning and strengthen the protection of natural scenery and cultural relics in order to improve our living environment .
we will double our attention to environmental problems .
in last year , the sudden outbreak of " s@@ ars " reminds us that we must create spacious , clean and healthy living environment .
we have to put in more efforts to beau@@ tify our environment - - plant more trees , build more parks and recreation facilities for the enjoyment of our citizens .
i would like to take this opportunity to thank those members of the legislative council ( leg@@ co ) who expressed their opinions on the different sections of the chief executive 's " policy address " , including justice and legal , constitution , civil servants and staff of subsidized organizations , and public security .
as to the justice and legal services area , only legislator marg@@ aret ng and legislator ts@@ ang y@@ ok - sing have made a statement and they are the chairman and vice chairman of the leg@@ co panel on the administration of justice and legal services .
the chief executive has proposed several measures in the " policy address " to push ahead people - based governance , including the strengthening of communication between principal officials and the society ; conduct more public policy research ; strengthen cooperation between the government and leg@@ co ; and finally proceed with a solemn and serious review of the constitutional system .
the department of justice will fully participate in the aforesaid works and strives to ensure all government measures conform to laws and procedures , especially the " basic law " , including the protection of basic rights and freedom to all citizens under the " basic law " . at the same time , the department will maintain its alertness , just as legislator marg@@ aret ng has said , in order to ensure hong kong is ruled by laws and the independence of judiciary system is maintained .
as a principal official , i will strive to understand the opinions of the general public and the legal profession on issues affecting judicial affairs and the legal profession .
for example , the " closer economic partnership arrangement " (c@@ ep@@ a) is the fruitful result of close cooperation between the government and the profession , including the bar association , the law society of hong kong and the association of china - appointed att@@ esting officers .
we have successfully included " legal services " in cep@@ a and rendered the profession an opened service industry in the mainland . this will provide a new platform to strengthen the cooperation between legal services in the two places and bring forth macro and long - term benefits to legal services in both places .
the work of the task force is two - way . we will gather views from the hong kong community and reflect them to the central government .
since middle of january this year , we have received more than ten organizations and individuals .
everyone accepts completely that constitutional development in hong kong must conform to " one country , two systems " and hong kong is under direct jurisdiction of central government .
the majority of them believe the constitutional system in hong kong needs improvement . at the same time , everyone also accepts any development must conform to the " basic law " .
some organizations or individuals also have their own opinions on specific procedure or legal issue .
the task force will convey their wishes , views and opinions to the central government in entirety .
in the coming month and so , the task force will continue to receive other organizations and individuals . we will pass on all opinions that we are going to receive to the central government .
this is only the first meeting of the task force with the relevant departments of the central government . in future , we still need to follow up and communicate more with the central government .
i believe everyone understands that constitutional development involves the relationship between central government and the special administrative region . the central government also has the constitutional power and duty to examine and review constitutional development in the special administrative region . for this , we need to make adequate discussions with the central government .
the west k@@ ow@@ loon cultural district is a large scale arts and cultural program never undertaken in hong kong . its aim is not only to provide arts , culture and entertainment to hong kong citizens but also to improve the quality of the city and its citizens .
the west k@@ ow@@ loon cultural district development belongs to the entire hong kong society .
the government will continue to explore the idea with all circles in the society such as to draw on collective wisdom and absorb all useful ideas .
we understand that we are not only seeking tall and magnificent buildings . we need them to possess the necessary economic benefits , capable of sustained development , and capable of improving citizen 's quality of life .
therefore , the government has attached high importance to the software required by the west k@@ ow@@ loon cultural district to form a matching set . it is necessary to introduce related policy for facilities management , promotion strategy for cultural programs , contents of performance and exhibition , and propaganda strategy etc. etc.
it is important to listen carefully to " users " opinion during the process of formulating these related policies .
the younger generation - - including every young pal sitting here - - you are going to be one of the major users of west k@@ ow@@ loon cultural district .
we hope that the district can fit the old and the young ; can suit both refined and popular tastes . irrespective you are a hong kong citizen or a foreign tourist and irrespective you are the more mature one or an energetic youth , we hope you can l@@ inger in the district with no thought of leaving .
i know that all of you have discussed the different issues of the west k@@ ow@@ loon cultural district this morning . some students have also spent a lot of time in the past month and so to compile a special topic report . i believe all of you are now very familiar with the details of this program .
i am extremely anxious to hear the conclusion of your discussions and look forward to exchange opinions with all of you .
since the september 11 terrorist attacks , the focus of our world is on security at harbors , airports and borders .
hong kong is shipping the highest number of containers to united states . as the number one port , hong kong has swiftly responded to the " container security initiative " brought up by u@@ .@@ s .
furthermore , we deeply believe that cutting off the lifeline of terrorist organizations can be an effective curb on terrorist activities .
for a long time , the massive inflow and outflow of funds through global financial system has been a nuisance to law enforcement agencies responsible for detection of money laundry and revenues derived from criminal activities .
as a major financial centre in asia , we believe by cutting off the financial sources of terrorists would be the most effective method to strike out their structure or foundation .
at present , legislative institution in hong kong is discussing various recommendations to tighten existing laws to curb any financial assistance to terrorist activities . hong kong is actively matching international standards and situations , for example , the new suggestion to set up a special financial affairs organization to combat money laundry activities , and we may amend our laws .
furthermore , we are appealing for the set up of more comprehensive information disclosure laws such that related institutions or individuals may report suspicious transactions .
" balance " is the key for any work in this area - - it is necessary to have sufficient power for effective investigation and at same time , there has to be appropriate constitutional protection for freedom , individual privacy , efficiency in our economic and financial systems . these are all factors that have to be considered .
our regulatory measures must be based on law and orders , with high transparency , are fair and effective .
in fact , hong kong 's service industries have advantages in many areas .
hong kong 's talents in professional or commercial services have in depth understanding of commercial operations in mainland and overseas countries .
hong kong 's professional services in accountancy , finance , law and arbitration will be mainland enterprises ' best partners as they become more internation@@ alize and have to align with international markets .
as to our transportation , construction , design and market promotion , management consulting , information technology , convention and exhibition services , they can help improve the overall productivity and competitiveness of mainland enterprises . they can also help formulate marketing strategy or improve brand images for enterprises and products .
as to tourism , health care and insurance services , they can contribute to promote the development of related market and industries in mainland and help elevate the service quality .
the close cooperation between service industries in the two places can greatly enhance their respective advantages and assist both sides to face the different types of opportunities and challenges brought forth by globalization .
in order to promote the development of professional services in mainland market , the financial secretary and i , and together with representatives of different professions as well as officials of related policy bureaus and administrative authorities , have started useful and substantive discussions with related departments and equivalent units of the mainland on the mutual recognition of professional qualification and other topics of concerns to professionals in beijing last week .
i am very glad that we signed the mutual recognition and cooperation agreement in the three professional areas of architect , structural engineers and insurance . this is an important step to enable the industries to explore the mainland market .
through this meeting , the professional organizations in hong kong have established a closer connection with the supervising authorities in mainland and laid a good foundation for the next phase of friendly cooperation .
i believe the majority of hong kong citizens love the mother country and love hong kong .
in fact , hong kong and mainland have always maintained close economic , social , political , cultural relation and connections before or after the reunification . everything is closely linked to each other .
on the economic front , we saw our nation started the four modern@@ izations over twenty years ago and the promotion of reform and opening . hong kong industries had the opportunity to move north and enjoyed a new dimension in development . this had already tightened the relation between mainland and hong kong society .
recently , we have another opportunity to fin@@ alize the closer economic partnership arrangement with the central government such that different service industries in hong kong can enjoy new opportunities ; can participate more actively and more broadly in the economic development in mainland . our service industries are now in a position to make useful contribution to our nation and to hong kong . at the same time , this will also tighten the relation between hong kong and mainland .
in social development , we can see our country is making progress at a tremendous pace .
hong kong citizens jumped for joy when they knew beijing 's bid for 2008 oly@@ mpic games was successful .
a few months ago , yang li@@ wei visited hong kong and hong kong people also jumped for joy , but why ?
it is because we feel our country has an achievement that every one of us , every citizen in hong kong can be proud of .
i know the legislative council started discussions with the government regarding a long - term office location for the legislative council ten years ago .
similarly , the government has been considering a long - term plan to relocate the central government offices for more than ten years .
therefore , i understand that some members of the legislative council will definitely be disappointed by the government 's decision to postpone the tam@@ ar development project , which includes the new legislative council complex .
i can understand that it is really great in@@ conveniences for members of the legislative council to continue to work in less - than - desired environment during this period of time .
however , just like what i told the colleagues in the government , who are equally affected by this decision , i hope everyone would put public interest as the major premise , understand the situation , and be patient during this period of time .
earlier , i have already explained several times to the administrative management committee of the legislative council - - after consideration of the current financial status of the government and the financial status after the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome last year , the government decided it is not the appropriate time to carry out the tam@@ ar project or any other large - scale office - building project .
the government is to postpone the new legislative council complex situated at tam@@ ar site . this can help reduce the financial strain to the government in the next few years . it is also in the interest of the public and will be accepted by the public .
the government will re - commence the development project of the tam@@ ar site and the new legislative council complex when the status of public finance improves . our existing plan is to do so .
our nation cares very much about hong kong . the president and the premier also care very much about hong kong . i know they and the central government will do whatever possible to perfect the job in this area .
so , it does not matter whether it is tourism , finance , infrastructure coordination , aviation rights , zero tariffs on products or service industries , i am sure good news will come one after another .
after a recovery in hong kong 's economy , i also hope hong kong can make better use of its own advantage and make greater contribution to the development of our country .
when i met with premier wen ji@@ abao , i have congratulated him on behalf of hong kong for his work in a very difficult year . under his leadership , our country has achieved admirable results . even though there are still many challenges in the future , you have heard his work report . he is full of confidence and for that , we are truly inspired .
premier wen has also told me to review m@@ r. deng xia@@ oping 's important discussion twenty years ago on " one country , two systems " . it is useful for us to obtain a comprehensive and precise understanding of the guiding principle of " one country , two systems " . this can help our political system development down the road .
he also told me that the people of hong kong should grasp this opportunity , concentrate our efforts to better develop the economy and do a good job in improving people 's livelihood . he is confident in hong kong .
later on , i will meet with m@@ r. zhang de@@ jiang , secretary of guangdong province , and m@@ r. huang hua@@ hua , governor of guangdong province , and explore with them how to elevate our cooperation to a new level on top of the existing foundation and create a bigger win - win situation .
the last point is " hong kong people ruling hong kong people " , which becomes all - too - familiar to everyone recently . this system relies on hong kong people , with patriots forming the main body , to manage hong kong .
as to patriots , there is also a clear standard . the criteria for a patri@@ ot are to respect one 's own nation ; a hong kong citizen that sincerely support the nation 's resumption of sovereignty over hong kong ; and not to do any harm to the nation or hong kong . the main body of hong kong leadership should be comprised of patriots .
i have to reiterate - - the vast majority of hong kong people are patriotic .
we are not talking about the public in general here , but rather those people who participate in management of public affairs in hong kong , and those high - ranking individuals within the administrative structure , the legislative council and the judiciary .
at the time when they sworn into office in accordance with the " basic law " , they have made clear their support for the " basic law " of hong kong special administrative region of the people 's republic of china and have pledged loyalty to the people 's republic of china and the hong kong special administrative region .
the five , six principles and important considerations that i just mentioned is a set of long - term policy and guiding principles developed when talks commenced in the eighties on the future of hong kong and at the time when the " joint declaration " and the " basic law " were formulated . it has not changed and it will not change because it is a series of long - term policy and guiding principles of our nation for the resumption of sovereignty rights over hong kong . it is a state policy and cannot be changed .
since the intellectual property system was found several hundred years ago , it has fostered the creation of important inventions with epoch - making significance one after the other , especially after the industrial revolution .
in the past twenty years , the intellectual property system has been the basic legal system and important policy measures to promote technology invention in different countries . the system plays an important role in the stimulation of economy and the strengthening of international competitiveness .
nowadays , globalization , science and technology are advancing rapidly . the creation , possession and application of the wealth in knowledge and know - how , together with the number and quality of intellectual property in possession have become important bases for different countries to participate in international competition .
therefore , we have to strengthen international communication and cooperation in the protection of intellectual property because it has an important meaning in the establishment of a rational and fair new order in international economies as well as the promotion of global economic prosperity and development .
the chinese government has attached high importance to the protection of intellectual property .
our country started to establish an intellectual property system at the beginning of the reform and opening . after over twenty years of endeavor , china has already brought into shape a relative complete legal system for intellectual property . china has also established an integrated intellectual property protection system comprised of judiciary and law enforcement agencies . china has done a lot of work in this area in order to make important contribution to promote scientific and technological progress as well as development in our society and economy .
in the twenty - first century , mankind has migr@@ ated themselves into an information society . technology revolution has propelled productivity advancement in our society with unprecedented momentum in our society .
it is necessary to further improve the intellectual property system in our country and strengthen international communication and cooperation in our work for the protection of intellectual property . this is a requirement for further opening of our country to foreigners in the new century . it is also a requirement for the construction of a modernized socialism society and the realization of a grand revival of the chinese race .
we are willing to go alongside with other countries and build a fair and reasonable intellectual property system that can facilitate technology and economic development in all countries . we will strive to create a good environment where everyone on earth respects knowledge , admires science and protects intellectual property .
the shanghai cooperation organization 's foremost task at this moment is to accelerate the systematic development of its organization .
after the endeavor of various parties , the preparation work for a secretariat and a regional anti - terrorism institution has achieved significant progress .
we need to make un@@ tiring efforts to ensure the secretariat can start this year and the regional anti - terrorism institution can be set up at an earlier date .
in order to express our high respect to the shanghai cooperation organization and as the host country of the secretariat , the chinese government has decided to provide the office space for the secretariat free of charge .
from now on , we will continue to provide strong support to ensure the secretariat can commence operations in a smooth way .
one of the important tasks for shanghai cooperation organization is to deepen and expand cooperation in security area .
there are " three stream of forces " seriously endangering the interests of member countries . we must not lower our alert and can never over - tolerate or accommodate them .
we need to proceed with long - term un@@ tiring efforts to eradicate these vicious forces such as to realistically maintain peace and stability in the region .
in order to cut off the capital source that may be used by the " three stream of forces " to finance their activities and also to initiate a more effective , more comprehensive attack on the " three stream of forces " , we must include the anti - drug problem into the schedule of security cooperation as soon as possible .
economic cooperation is the important foundation and a priority for the shanghai cooperation organization .
education is the cornerstone of modern civilization .
to improve the quality of our nationals and to strengthen the overall national power , we must put in great efforts to develop education .
education in rural villages has extensive influence and is affecting the overall economic development in both rural villages and our society .
since the reform and opening , the appearance of cities and villages in our nation has gone through substantial and profound changes . this has a close connection with education , especially education in rural villages .
after rural villages implemented the household contract responsibility system , productivity has been greatly enhanced .
we can see that advance and practical technology are in widespread usage in agriculture ; township enterprise has suddenly emerged as a new force ; and surplus labor in rural areas can m@@ igrate in great numbers to coastal regions and cities . one of the fundamental cause for these phenomena is the solid foundation and support from hundreds of million in the rural labor force that have received the mandatory education . universal mandatory education has great accomplishments and its contribution could never be ignored .
at present , the agriculture industry in our country and the rural economy are both situated at a critical juncture of development . there are urgent needs for all - round quality improvement in the labor force at rural villages because of the migration to high quality , high efficiency , ecology and safe agriculture ; expansion in the scale of operations in the agricultural industry ; and the transfer of rural surplus labor force .
the technology revolution in the world and our migration towards a full - scale fairly prosperous society have imposed higher demands on the general rural population in terms of their scientific , cultural , ideological and moral quality .
without the " 9 - year universal mandatory education " , there cannot be any all - round quality improvement for peasants and it would be difficult to realize a fairly prosperous society .
we must fully recognize the function of rural education , including its foundation effect , leading nature and its overall role in the development of a full - scale fairly prosperous society .
consultants and guests participating in this conference include senior leaders of multin@@ ation@@ als , world - renowned economists , experts and scholars with profound at@@ tain@@ ments .
i can deeply feel the sincere spirit in cooperation and the enthusiastic stand to deal with concrete matters offered by every consultant here .

iraq 's governing council has signed an agreement with u@@ .@@ s . occupying forces a few days ago . they announced a phased timetable for the power transfer to the people of iraq by june next year .
this agreement has received the reluctant validation by international community - - even though the foreign minister of european union welcomed the agreement , france believe " the process is too slow " . united nations secretary general ann@@ an is inspired by the " plan to transfer power " but at the same time , he thinks , " the opportune moment is not ripe yet " for united nations to play a role in iraq . russia has simply challenged the legality of the agreement .
the people of iraq are indifferent to the agreement ; u@@ .@@ s . public opinions even consider the agreement " a major gamble " .
any@@ how , most people are between believing and suspicion . most of them are adopting a wait and see attitude .
it is not without reason that international community has so many doubts about it .
people can see that u@@ .@@ s . is not really willing to return sovereignty to people of iraq . therefore , the transfer of political power may not be thorough and it is likely to have a lot of hidden issues .
first , the transitional government scheduled to be formed in may next year is not derived from direct election . instead , it is elected by the " transitional national assembly " , which , in turn , is elected by 18 election committees at provincial level .
inevitably , people may think u@@ .@@ s . controls the process and its legitimacy might be challenged .
second , u@@ .@@ s . announced that u@@ .@@ s . troops would not withdraw even after the power transfer . effectively , they are just changing from " occupying forces " to " existing forces " only .
u@@ .@@ s . government announced on november 18 its decision to start imposing quotas on three kinds of textile products , namely st@@ oc@@ kin@@ et , br@@ assi@@ ere and g@@ own .
at a time when china strives to expand sino - u@@ .@@ s . cooperation in economy and trade , u@@ .@@ s . government 's protective measure has certainly made everyone felt sorry .
with globalization developed to its current status , it is certainly out of time for u@@ .@@ s . to re - impose quotas on chinese textile products .
first , such abuse of " quota " restricts the thorough implementation of world trade organization 's free trade principle .
on one hand , u@@ .@@ s . is talking in high - sounding tone about " free trade " . on the other hand , it re - establishes trade barriers and st@@ abs your back at will with " quotas " . does it appear too arbitrary and unfair ?
second , " quota " limits the nice growth trend in sino - america trade relation .
since china and u@@ .@@ s . reached an agreement for china to join the world trade organization in 1999 , import from u@@ .@@ s . is increasing at 15 percent a year on average .
in january to september this year , china 's import from u@@ .@@ s . has increased 2@@ 6.2 % over corresponding period .
in the past two years , china 's import of textile materials and garments from u@@ .@@ s . has increased rapidly .
in fact , u@@ .@@ s . export to china is increasing at the fastest rate amongst all of its trading partners .
bush 's visit to britain failed to meet his wishes and there are many reasons for that . the most important one is that u@@ .@@ s . became the sole superpower in the world after the conclusion of the cold war and it simply turns blind eyes to others as its unilater@@ alism expands .
united states has launched the war against iraq without united nations authorization . it shows no respect for the opinions of its main allies on major international issues including , for example , the iraq reconstruction . u@@ .@@ s . persists in its own way and has provoked public anger .
a poll recently released by the commission of european union shows 68 percent of the citizens in european union believe u@@ .@@ s . do not have adequate reasons for its war against iraq and 53 percent think u@@ .@@ s . constitutes a threat to world peace .
second , united states emphasizes on anti - terrorism . it asks its allies to contribute human resources and financial means but it pays no attention to matters that its allies care about .
the united states has grasped iraq 's reconstruction projects tightly in its hand . the main contracts in the first tender were all given to its own companies and nothing was given to others . for the dispute over steel , the world trade organization has made a ruling that the high u@@ .@@ s . levy is against regulation . the commerce and industrial sector in britain hopes that bush would make some concessions in this trip but in the end , bush did not clearly declare his stand .
third , united states regards its concept of value as the highest norm , which over@@ rides concepts of all other countries . it insists to impose democratic reforms in middle east countries but has encountered re@@ pro@@ aches . some allies demanded that united states should respect iraq 's isl@@ amic culture and characteristics . they believe one of the reasons why u@@ .@@ s . troop was bogged down in qu@@ agm@@ ire in iraq is the bitter fruit of " dis@@ respect " .
however , bush would not mend his own ways just because of widespread criticism and opposition . during his visit , he once again defended his iraq policy , emphasizing the u@@ .@@ s . - britain coalition forces would continue to cope with violent events inside iraq by force .
since bush 's visit to britain failed to meet his wishes , the situation in iraq would not necessarily develop in the direction as the white house wishes .
after lengthy debates over the past six months , an advance detachment of japan 's self - defense forces has departed for iraq at the end of 2003 .
this is the first time that japan sends soldiers to a foreign battle@@ ground since the end of world war ii .
it reflects japan 's wish to m@@ igrate towards a political and military super power and signifies a change in japan 's defense strategy .
the self - defense forces ' trip ar@@ ouses attention because it is not an isolated incident .
japan took the opportunity of the af@@ gh@@ anistan war and made a breakthrough deployment of self - defense forces to a foreign country . japan used the korean peninsula problem and passed the " war contingency laws " , which fore@@ shadows the use of force or even pre@@ emptive attack by self - defense forces . recently , ko@@ izumi 's cabinet made preparation for troop deployment to iraq through " the basic plan on reconstruction in iraq " .
one step after another , japan has finally overcome the restriction of its constitution and succeeded in dispatching soldiers to foreign combat fields .
furthermore , japan is preparing to amend its " concept of basic defense force " in 2004 such as to leg@@ alize the deployment of japanese troops to a foreign country and make that a permanent arrangement . japan also intends to send " permanent force " , which is not temporarily assembled , to overseas countries .
meanwhile , the japanese cabinet has used the so - called " north korea missile threat " as a reason and decided to commence the deployment of national missile defense program from the beginning of 2004 . japan will import u@@ .@@ s . made " standard missile 3 " and " patri@@ ot 3 " missiles , which can intercept missiles outside and re - entering the earth 's atmosphere respectively and thus building a double interception system .
it is not difficult to see japan 's self - defense forces are developing the " combined capability of attack and defense " and the so - called " self - defense forces " specializing in " passive defense " will exist in name only .
japan 's movement has raised concerns because these military policies impact japan 's pac@@ if@@ ist constitution .
ko@@ izumi has made a formal visit to the ya@@ su@@ kuni shrine and he defended his behavior during an interview by reporters .
however , his argument is contradic@@ ting and full of loopholes .
reporters asked ko@@ izumi why he is visiting the shrine . ko@@ izumi replied , " japan 's peace and prosperity are realized on the foundation of sacrifices in the war .
i am making a formal visit to pray for peace and prosperity in japan . "
we would like to ask : does ko@@ izumi 's so - called " sacrifices in war " include class - a war criminals in word war ii like hi@@ de@@ ki to@@ jo etc. ?
can we say that japan 's peace and prosperity after the war are also based on contributions from class - a war criminals ?
some reporters asked why he chose january 1 to visit the ya@@ su@@ kuni shrine ?
ko@@ izumi said a formal visit to a shrine on the first day of a new year is japan 's con@@ fuci@@ an or@@ thodo@@ xy . in fact , many people would pay a formal visit to a shrine on that day .
it is understandable that many ordinary people would like to remember their family members or friends . in fact , many distressed relatives are making it clear that they are visiting the ya@@ su@@ kuni shrine in memory of their family members or friends and they strongly oppose any class - a war criminals be enshrined in the ya@@ su@@ kuni shrine .
the people of china are willing to listen to reasons . all along , we insist to separate the people of japan from a small group of militarists . we need to separate ordinary people from right - wing extremists . ordinary citizens visiting the ya@@ su@@ kuni shrine are not the crux of this history problem .
unity is strength .
this is an inde@@ struc@@ tible truth .
in order to realize the grand objective of building a full - scale fairly prosperous society and accomplish the holy undertaking for a great revival of the chinese people , we must unite all forces available .
in a new century and in a new phase , the work of the patriotic united front and the people 's political consultative conference must use this as the basic start off and stop over points .
we must adhere to and perfect the multi - party cooperation and political consultation system led by the chinese communist party . we must further strengthen and develop the patriotic united front . we must fully mobilize all positive factors on all fronts and add power unceasingly to the great revival of the chinese people .
in the past one year , the people 's political consultative conference has firmly grasped the two main themes of unity and democracy . it has conscientiously fulfilled its different functions in order to promote a comprehensive development in our economy and our society . it has played an important role to protect the overall stability of our reform and development .
in the new year , we hope the people 's political consultative conference will closely en@@ circle the party and the center of the country and do an even better job in political consultation , democratic supervision , participation and discussion of politics . the conference should enhance the fine points in con@@ fuci@@ an or@@ thodo@@ xy , bringing our advantages into play and perform in - depth study and research . the conference should actively provide advice and policy suggestion such as to make new and better contribution in the construction of a full - scale fairly prosperous society .
the head of state meeting for the 12th south asian association for regional cooperation (@@ sa@@ arc@@ ) was held january 4 - 6 in isl@@ am@@ abad after a delay for a full year . the meeting approved several documents , including " south asian free trade framework agreement " , " additional protocol to sa@@ ar@@ c on suppression of terrorism " , " social charter for south asia " etc. , and announced that members of sa@@ ar@@ c will strive for common development and cooperation in economy , culture and anti - terrorism .
during the sa@@ ar@@ c summit , the bilateral meeting of indian prime minister v@@ aj@@ payee and pak@@ istani president mus@@ har@@ raf was especially conspicuous .
in the last summit , v@@ aj@@ payee and mus@@ har@@ raf shook their hands but that did not give people too much hope to the relation development between the two countries .
after two years , tensions between the two countries eased up following a series of important measures including resumption of normal foreign relations , resumption of land and air traffic , and cease - fire in kash@@ mir region etc. finally , the two sides have taken the opportunity in the south asia summit and realized a meeting at the top .
the two countries have taken another stride forward in the process of improving their bilateral relation , which is a favorable turn for cooperation in south asia region .
notwithstanding india 's foreign minister sin@@ ha said on the 4th that the meeting was of " ceremonial nature " , most people believe the meeting means india and pakistan relation is heading for a more positive and practical direction .
the leaders of both countries have recognized that tensions and hostility are not in the interests of their nations . on the other hand , they are missing economic development opportunities time after time .
as globalization intensi@@ fies , the urgent tasks of the two governments are to revive their economies and strengthen their cooperation .
despite official result of the presidential election in ge@@ or@@ gia on the 4th has yet to be revealed , it looks the victory of sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i , a candidate jointly supported by right wing parties and the leader of national movement , is the inevitable outcome .
the central election commission of ge@@ or@@ gia said on the 7th that , in the 89 % of votes already counted , over 95 % of the voters supported sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i .
some heads of the commonwealth of independent states have already sent congratulatory tele@@ grams to this young politician .
actually , sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i has already proclaimed victory himself as early as the night that the voting ended .
he claimed the result of the polls is a " victory of the people " and said ge@@ or@@ gia will take some rapid actions to create its own future .
in interviews by media , many voters said they cast their votes to sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i for the purposes of choosing a " new hope " .
even the former president sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ nad@@ ze , who was forced to resign , expressed support to this political rival of the old days and praised sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i as " young , energetic and well educated " .
at the same time of putting hopes on sa@@ ak@@ ash@@ vil@@ i , people also noticed that there were no major changes in ge@@ or@@ gia 's situation after sh@@ ev@@ ard@@ nad@@ ze 's resignation two months ago .
we can say that the newly elected president is still facing the same old problems .
the past year was an important but unusual year in the development process of our country .
we have fought the sudden outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome with extreme hardships and difficulties but we finally achieved a great victory at that stage . the economy in our country continued to maintain a nice growth trend . we have climbed another step as the average per capita production surged above 1,000 u@@ .@@ s . dollars . the " shen@@ zhou 5 " manned space flight was concluded with great success and the chinese people 's dream on space flights has been realized . our nationals are un@@ tied , the society is progressing and people 's liv@@ ings are better than before .
the achievements of our country in many areas have become the focus of world attention . everyone in the country has contributed tremendous efforts and is showing courage and strength to create miracle . no one is scared of hardships or dangers .
looking into the new year , we are full of confidence and wishes .
judging from the overall domestic and international situations , our country is situated at an important strategic opportunity period that we must tightly grasp and make maximum use of it .
we have to adhere to deng xia@@ oping 's theories and the important guiding thoughts of " three represents " . we have to thoroughly put into effect the spirit of the 16th cpc national congress and the 16th communist party congress . we must conscientiously implement the major policies and overall plans of the central government for this year . we must continue to push ahead reform , opening , modernization and development .
in order to do this year 's job properly , we must correctly grasp the circumstances . it is necessary to visu@@ alize favorable conditions , new opportunities as well as unfavorable conditions and new challenges . we have to increase our sense of responsibility , our sense of urgency and our sense of concern .
a three - party meeting on the iraq problem was held in united nations ' new york headquarters on the 19th and ann@@ an , the secretary general of united nation (@@ un@@ ) , exchanged views with representatives from iraq 's governing council and u@@ .@@ s . - britain coalition provisional authority . their discussions focused on how un can play a role in iraq 's reconstruction .
the three sides have exchanged views candi@@ dly and the discussion involved politics , humanity and security issues in iraq as well as the appointment of a special un representative to be stationed in iraq .
u@@ .@@ s . - britain is at a critical juncture where their plan to transfer power in iraq might be boy@@ cot@@ ted . as a result , people are watching attentively whether and how un may involve in the reconstruction of iraq .
since u@@ .@@ s . announced that the main war in iraq has ended in early may last year , the situation in iraq continues to be unstable . attacks came one after the other as protests against the occupation and are causing countless casualties to the u@@ .@@ s . - britain coalition . there is hardly any peaceful day .
the former president of iraq , sad@@ dem hus@@ sein , was captured on december 13 last year but the joy in u@@ .@@ s . failed to endure . the security situation in iraq has not improved . resistance activities have intensified and are pushing the occupying forces into a difficulty position .
on the other hand , the people of iraq and arab countries have unanimously demanded foreign troops to leave and return sovereignty to iraq , thus allowing the people of iraq to manage their own country .
meanwhile , u@@ .@@ s . and britain are making every effort to re - mold the iraq regime according to their wishes because on such a foundation , they can gradually extricate themselves from this qu@@ agm@@ ire " in an elegant way " .
for this purpose , the process and the model of power transfer have become the focus of iraq affairs at this time .
the tentative plan brought up by u@@ .@@ s . - britain provisional authority and iraq 's governing council in november last year is : a transitional government is to be formed before july 1 this year through an election in the " transitional national assembly " but " provincial election committee " nomin@@ ates the representatives to attend the assembly .
iraq 's shi@@ ite , which accounts for the majority of the population , stressed that a nationwide direct election is the fair way to return sovereignty to iraq .
u@@ .@@ s . secretary of state pow@@ ell 's visit to russia is still a conspicuous focal point of public opinions .
this is because of decisive roles played by u@@ .@@ s . and russia . their relation may have a profound impact to the modern world .
more important , pow@@ ell 's moscow trip is full of practical contents and has transmitted a clear signal - - as far as russia - u@@ .@@ s . relation is concerned , there is a dark cloud over the sky .
if this dark cloud is not promptly dissip@@ ated , the future relation of two countries may turn dim .
despite the channel for dialogue between washington and moscow is clear , pow@@ ell has decided to clarify his position through an article in russia 's influential newspaper , the " iz@@ v@@ esti@@ a " .
pow@@ ell said in the article that u@@ .@@ s . is confused by a series of events in russia 's internal affairs and foreign affairs over the past few months .
he is of the opinion that the russian administration is not totally accepting the restr@@ ains of legal system and its position in certain crucial factors of a democratic society is not firm , including freedom of information and political party development .
u@@ .@@ s . is especially disturbed by russia 's policy in ch@@ ech@@ en and its attitude towards the neighboring commonwealth of the independent states .
to diplomats , the use of public media to declare one 's stand is considered the " last mode " of communication .
the original intention for u@@ .@@ s . to make such a choice is pregnant with meaning but the embarrassment and dissatisfaction on the russia side is obvious to everyone .
as we entered the new century , globalization becomes an important and rigorous challenge facing african countries .
the leaders of african countries understand more and more clearly that africa cannot let slip a good opportunity and should rise with spirit to found counter measures .
on july 9, 2002 , the african union was formed and has commenced operations . since then , on one hand , african countries have been actively promoting the " new partnership for african development " . they endeavor to develop their economies and strive to break away from an unfavorable position in globalization . on the other hand , african countries are exerting great efforts to remove any man - made barriers to the grand mission of an africa revival - - the armed conflict problem , such as to create a united , peaceful and stable environment .
at present , the overall situation in africa is easing up and hot issues are cooling down . different nations are feeling the sense of urgency to end the armed conflict .
with the strong support from united nations and international community , influential regional institutions in africa , big countries in the regions and even famous politicians are all taking active actions to step up efforts to resolve regional conflict and internal turmoil . as a result , some prolonged conflict and instability are basically under control .
for example , the democratic republic of con@@ go has formed a national reconciliation government in june last year . the republic of s@@ ao t@@ ome and princi@@ pe has resolved its coup crisis peacefully in july last year . the government of liber@@ ia has signed a peace accord with the armed rebels in acc@@ ra , capital of gh@@ ana , in august last year . the sud@@ an government has held a crucial meeting with the southern - armed rebels in september last year , which was a breakthrough of the deadlock in the peace process . in october , the different armed and political groups in som@@ ali have held peace talks in ken@@ ya to discuss a nationwide peace process . in november , bur@@ undi government has signed a peace accord with anti - government rebels .
naturally , stability in the african region is still relatively fragile and the peace fruit still requires further strengthening . some potential or actual armed conflicts are still awaiting a final resolution .
meanwhile , the pace of economic development in african countries is still showing a huge gap with that in developing countries in asia . this is obviously an unfavorable factor for development in africa .
it obviously requires long - term and arduous efforts from the people of africa before african countries can effectively deal with the challenges of globalization and realize the dream of an africa revival .
recently , there are outbreaks of highly pathog@@ enic avian influenza one after another in some regions of our country .
party 's central committee (p@@ cc@@ ) and government administration council (g@@ ac@@ ) have attached high importance to this . they swiftly made a series of important decisions and brought up clear , definite guiding principles , measures and policy for prevention and control .
related local authorities and departments have taken urgent actions and , in accordance with p@@ cc and ga@@ c deployment , are sparing no efforts to stop the epidemic disease from spreading .
at present , intense prevention and control work are proceeding in a systematic manner across the nation to combat the avian flu .
the highly pathog@@ enic avian flu is a type of animal epidemic disease that can spread rapidly and causes great harm to animals . the disease may seriously endanger the production in livestock industry as well as the health and safety of the public .
it is important to perfect the work in prevention and control of the highly pathog@@ enic avian flu because it affects public health and safety ; affects the development of agriculture and farmers ' income ; affects overall economic development ; and affects the stability of our society . all regions and departments should be guided by the important thought of " three represents " and operate in accordance with the requirement of the " animal epidemic prevention law of the peoples ' republic of china " . all regions and departments should strengthen their leadership , operate in close coordination , base on scientific knowledge and in accordance with law , including group prevention and group control . authorities should be decisive in actions in order to be highly responsible to the public . officials must conscientiously implement the different prevention and control measures . every one must have the determination to win this blocking action of avian flu .
as the largest debtor country in the world , united states ' foreign debt is on the rise again .
u@@ .@@ s . treasury department announced on january 16 that the country owes a total of 6.@@ 4@@ 94 trillion u@@ .@@ s . dollars to all kinds of foreign creditors , 2.2 percent higher than the previous announcement .
on average , every american shares a debt of over twenty thousand u@@ .@@ s . dollars .
as a coincidence , international monetary fund released a research report just a week earlier , which sounded the warning bell , in a sharp and systematically way , against america 's fal@@ tering financial base . the report pointed out the country 's external debt , which keeps on hitting new records , has grown to an extent that threatens the global financial stability .
statistics show that foreign private investors are holding some 40 percent of all u@@ .@@ s . government bonds .
this reminds us the idea presented by key@@ n@@ es to president ro@@ os@@ evel@@ t in the first half of the 20th century - - adopt a deficit policy to stimulate economy at home and borrow money from other countries to make up for the shortfall .
the measure did play an important role to stimulate " effective demand " and could ease a financial crisis as pressing as a fire sing@@ eing one 's eye@@ brows .
however , people can see many american administrations followed the same measure and taken it as a " miraculous cure " .
since president re@@ agan called for tax cut and arms expansion in the eighties of the twentieth century , u@@ .@@ s . fiscal deficits are increasing gradually and eventually turned u@@ .@@ s . into the biggest debtor nation .
the convention of the first round six - party talks was an important step forward for a peaceful resolution of the nuclear problem in korean peninsula through dialogue .
in the first round of talks , the different sides have come to some common points . the meeting laid down the necessary foundation for future talks and also further clarified the objective , route and guiding principle to resolve the nuclear problem in korean peninsula .
in the past several months , the relevant sides have all insisted to resolve the nuclear problem in korean peninsula peacefully through dialogue . based on the foundation of the results of first round of talks , different sides have proceeded with a wide range of coordination and discussions at different levels such as to contribute un@@ tiring efforts to hold the second round meeting at an earlier date .
meanwhile , north korea and u@@ .@@ s . have also shown more flexibility at various levels .
right now , the preparation work for more talks have achieved important progress and a good meeting is what everybody wants .
the relevant sides and the international community are all following with interest on issues like what kind of results can be achieved in the second round talks , or whether the peace process can continue .
for this , a spokesman of china 's ministry of foreign affairs said the objective of the six - party talks is to maintain dialogue and push ahead the peace process . china is willing to work jointly with other parties on this objective .
china 's starting point is to maintain peace and stability in the korean peninsula and realize den@@ u@@ clear@@ ization in the peninsula .
china believes if all parties to the meeting maintain their sincerity , respect each other , and consult each other on the basis of equality , then that would create favorable conditions for the resolution of the related problem .
u@@ .@@ s . - lib@@ ya relation deteriorated at the end of seventies in the last century and the two countries terminated diplomatic relation in 1981 .
u@@ .@@ s . president re@@ agan has drawn up a list of accusations against the lib@@ yan leader q@@ ad@@ ha@@ fi including secret development of nuclear weapons , military interference in foreign countries and terrorism etc.
the quarrel between the two sides had finally turned into warfare . u@@ .@@ s . launched two surgical - type air raids on lib@@ ya , code - named " operation pr@@ airi@@ e fire " and " operation el dor@@ ado can@@ y@@ on " .
thereafter , u@@ .@@ s . imposed economic sanction on lib@@ ya and attacked lib@@ ya on the political front , suppressed it in foreign affairs and continued to threaten the country militarily .
however , q@@ ad@@ ha@@ fi did not give in under the heavy pressure .
at present , u@@ .@@ s . - lib@@ ya relation has improved . some people have given credit to the effect of the iraq war , which terror@@ ize others by military force , but that might be a biased judgment .
in fact , for many years , the peculiar character q@@ ad@@ ha@@ fi has been cont@@ ending u@@ .@@ s . on one hand but on the other hand , he was also throwing branches of the ol@@ ive tree towards u@@ .@@ s . regrettably , lib@@ ya has not received any response from u@@ .@@ s .
after the iraq war ended , the different sides in middle east have adjusted their strategy . the re@@ distribution of power in the region has provided a turning point for the resumption of diplomatic relation between u@@ .@@ s . and lib@@ ya .
to q@@ ad@@ ha@@ fi , the cultivation of friendship with u@@ .@@ s . can terminate the economic sanction . lib@@ ya can then develop vigorously its economy , improves the living of its people , breaks away from isolation and bl@@ ends into international community .
by giving up something that lib@@ ya has never achieved and cannot achieve in a short time , lib@@ ya can m@@ igrate into a new environment and no wonder people sometimes say , " past the dark will@@ ows and flowers in bloom lies another village " .
in february 7 - 8 , important political figures from europe , u@@ .@@ s . and other regions in the world gathered in mun@@ ich of germany to attend the 4@@ 4th mun@@ ich conference on security policy .
the so - called " mun@@ ich conference on security policy " is a forum for international security issues organized by a non - governmental institution in germany but sponsored by the german government . in recent years and especially after " september 11 " , more and more people are starting to attach importance to the event and it is praised as " d@@ avo@@ s forum " for security .
one of the important topics for discussion in this meeting is the cross at@@ lan@@ tic relation .
judging from the words of political figures during meetings and off meetings , both sides are trying hard to get rid of the shadows to their relation cast by the iraq war and strive to return to the path of cooperation .
ber@@ tram , head of ber@@ lin 's institute for international politics and security , said that the meeting is an occasion for u@@ .@@ s . and europe to repair their relation and both sides are showing desire to line up again with each other .
for europe - u@@ .@@ s . relation , the new message from the meeting is that europe and u@@ .@@ s . need some new dialogue . they have to seriously consider the common mission faced by them and identify the conver@@ gent point of interests in fulfilling these missions .
in contrast to the meeting last year , this year is not explosive at all and the stands of both sides are close .
the " old europe " represented by france and germany are still deeply concerned at heart about the u@@ .@@ s . war against iraq but indicated the necessity to " look ahead " .
german foreign minister f@@ ischer said in the meeting , " despite our view on the war is different , we still need to jointly ensure iraq has peace after the war and for this , we must look ahead " .
he further said germany will not send soldiers to iraq but germany does not intend to block nato from playing a direct role in iraq .
u@@ .@@ s . has grabbed the early opportunities in modern mass media and monopol@@ izes the rights to speak in a fairly large portion of international news . its public opinions and propaganda are reaching out to the whole world ; virtually to a level that it can get in by every opening . and now , why does u@@ .@@ s . bother to put in huge sums to set up a special satellite television station to cover the 22 countries in middle east ?
to use the words of the person in charge at " the free one " television , u@@ .@@ s . is trying to provide ar@@ ab@@ ian countries with a news platform featuring " fair and all - round viewpoint " .
nevertheless , analysts pointed out that " the free one " is u@@ .@@ s . strategic weapon to perme@@ ate into public opinions of ar@@ ab@@ ian countries . it is a cultural invasion and a psychological attack plan . it is u@@ .@@ s . propaganda machine to help push ahead the integration in middle east and an attempt to reform the policy in isl@@ amic world .
judging from this , " the free one " has unusual missions . if we select the most important ones , there are roughly three of them : first , to broadcast the " free concept " .
u@@ .@@ s . believes the isl@@ amic civilization is a serious obstruction to the promotion of modern civilization by western world . the extreme religious forces in isl@@ amic countries in middle east are breeding grounds for international terrorism with an anti - america characteristic . it is necessary to reform the isl@@ amic world in order for anti - terrorism to be effective . it is necessary to make the isl@@ amic world recognize and accept western values , living style and political systems .
u@@ .@@ s . is attempting to change and influence ar@@ ab@@ ians un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sively and imper@@ cep@@ ti@@ bly by in@@ cul@@ c@@ ating its ideology through programs on " the free one " .
second , to improve the image of united states .
u@@ .@@ s . is adopting unilater@@ alism in its foreign affairs . in a series of international issues , u@@ .@@ s . has been in@@ ordin@@ ately proud of its strength and persists in its own way . its high - handed actions have caused resentment and complaints from ar@@ ab@@ ian countries and the isl@@ amic world .
since the " september 11 " incident , america 's consistent undue favor for israel has intensified its contradiction with the isl@@ amic world in middle east .
u@@ .@@ s . has used anti - terrorism and elimination of mass destruction weapon as an excuse and invaded iraq without any concrete evidence or authorization from united nations . its act has provoked strong resentment from the muslim public .
the peace hope in south asia sub@@ continent has risen again as pak@@ istani and indian officials held talks on february 16 - 18 in isl@@ am@@ abad .
the officials of the two countries have established the mechanism for continued dialogue down the road , including a confirmed schedule and model of the talks . this symbolizes the re@@ start of the dialogue process between pakistan and india after an interruption of two years and has paved a foundation for the two countries to sort out gradually all the questions hanging in the air , including the kash@@ mir dispute . it is also a realization of their precious sincerity for peace .
before this talk , many analysts are still very conservative about the future of the peace process , despite a series of good intentions exhibited by both sides have already war@@ med up their relation .
this is not to be blamed given the rapid ups and downs in pakistan - india relation over the past few years . it looks as if no one dares to guarantee anything - - the sunshine illumin@@ ates on the negotiation table today may turn into thunder and lightning at the border tomorrow .
nevertheless , when pakistan foreign secretary ri@@ az k@@ ho@@ k@@ har read out the joint statement of the two nations with a smiling face on the 18th , optimistic feelings are perme@@ ating for another time . suddenly , a new light sh@@ ines into the eyes of those who have been watching the south asia situation for a long period of time .
first , the timetable agreed in the meeting is feasible and both sides have not only confirmed the specific schedule and topics for meeting but also assigned levels to different talks in accordance with the importance of the topic involved .
second , both sides have learned from the failure in the ag@@ ra summit back in july 2001 , in which direct dialogue between leaders of the two countries had led to a total failure of the meeting . this time , the dialogue will use a " step - by - step " model . talks will start from a low level and gradually move to higher levels such as to make sufficient preparation for dialogue at senior level .
in addition , after the several ups and downs in bilateral relation between the two countries , both sides are now in unanim@@ ity that war is not a good solution for problems and one should better stay away from it . this common consensus has laid a foundation for the leaders of the two countries to reach an understanding of " no more war between pakistan and india " some time in the future .
in order to understand precisely and carry through the guiding principle of " one country , two systems " , it is necessary to link " one country " to " two systems " and " patriotic to nation " with " patriotic to hong kong " . the admiration for a highly autonomous hong kong has to be linked to the maintenance of sovereignty in our country . the continuation of capitalism in hong kong has also to be linked to the socialism advocated by our country .
it is only then can hong kong compatriots ' well@@ being be realistically protected and everything conforms to the long - term interests of our nation and its people .
since the reunification of hong kong , the central government is determined to adhere to the guiding principle of " one country , two systems " and has handled all affairs strictly according to the basic law .
the vast majority of compatriots in hong kong are enjoying unprecedented democratic rights in the position as a host .
with the strong support from central government and the motherland , hong kong has overcome various risks and challenges , including the impacts of the asian financial crisis . hong kong continues to maintain its position as an international finance , trade and shipping center .
the guiding principle of " one country , two systems " has proven to have strong vitality after its implementation in real life .
today , the re - publication of comrade deng xia@@ oping 's speech twenty years ago has shown to everyone in the world the strong determination of the central government to implement and adhere to the guiding principle of " one country , two systems " . furthermore , it is also for the purpose of enabling everyone to understand precisely the guidance of " one country , two systems " such as to push ahead the grand implementation of " one country , two systems " .
today , the central committee of the cpc and the state council are solemnly convening the state science and technological award convention here .
president hu j@@ intao will confer the 2003 state pre@@ eminent science and technological award to two academicians , liu d@@ ong@@ sheng and wang yong@@ zhi .
this convention will also award the national science and technology awards ( top grade ) for " china 's manned space project " , the 2003 national award for natural sciences , national award for technological invention , and national award for science and technology progress to their a@@ war@@ dees .
on behalf of the central committee of the cpc and the state council , i would like to express enthusiastic congratulations to all a@@ war@@ dees .
i also wish to extend my sincere regards and este@@ emed respects to all technology personnel on all front lines across our nation .
the first 20 years of this century is an important strategic opportunity period for our nation . we must tightly grasp it and make maximum use of it .
we should gather all forces and construct a full - scale fairly prosperous society at a higher level that benefits our population of over 1 billion .
we should make best use of this strategic opportunity period and strive for some accomplishments . we must put development of science and technology at a more notable position and attach more importance to it .
since the " september 11 " incident , u@@ .@@ s . president bush has introduced the " pre@@ emptive strike " policy in june 2002 . the policy was applied in u@@ .@@ s . foreign affairs and the first " pre@@ emptive strike " war took place in march last year against iraq .
the concept of " pre@@ emptive strike " directly contradic@@ ts the core principle of " respecting sovereignty and territorial integrity of each other " in international law . moreover , it has the danger that others may copy and follow this principle and thus causing new instability in international order .
when the theory of " pre@@ emptive strike " first came out , some important political figures in u@@ .@@ s . had already raised this question , " what should we do if other countries gradually follow our way ? "
unfortunately just as predicted , more and more countries are saying they would " strike first " in the past two years and the " pre@@ emptive strike " team gets bigger and bigger .
this is obviously a new trend worthwhile attention and study .
in the same month as bush brought out the " strike first " strategy , australian prime minister h@@ oward was the first one to stand out and expressed support .
he said once australia has obtained reliable information about terrorist attack on the country , it will adopt the " strike first " strategy and is not hesitate to initiate military actions against nearby countries .
he even proposes to amend the charter of union nations such that the " strike first " principle can be written in the charter giving nations the right to " strike first " . he thinks this is necessary for the suppression of terrorists or the suppression of countries that support terrorist activities .
in northeastern asia , japan defense agency also released a " defense white paper " in july 1999 proposing that japan may attack foreign bases under the " strike first " principle when it faces possible missile attack or on the verge of being invaded militarily .
since the iraq war , it is widely reported that japan is stepping up its call for " strike first " strategy .
recently , a lot of international public opinions commented on u@@ .@@ s . current policy on africa .
an article entitled the " africa policy outlook 2004 " , published in the january 2004 issue of " foreign policy in focus " in u@@ .@@ s . , believe the foreign policy of bush administration has brought forth negative impacts directly and indirectly to africa . u@@ .@@ s . continues to fully focus on the war against terrorism and the problem of proliferation in weapon of mass destruction . in particular , u@@ .@@ s . is tied up in iraq and cannot afford to give too much attention to africa .
many of us still recall the bush administration has established the " president 's emergency plan for aids relief " in january last year to express care for africa and undertook to provide a minimum of us $ 3 billion a year to africa .
in july last year , bush visited the five african countries of sen@@ eg@@ al , south africa , bot@@ swana , ug@@ anda and n@@ ig@@ eria and has promised various assistance to africa , including us $ 15 billion for the prevention and control of aids , another us $ 100 million to combat terrorist activities in africa , emergency food relief and education assistance program etc.
these assistance programs were once welcomed by african countries and won numerous praises from international community .
nevertheless , u@@ .@@ s . has not proceeded with any specific implementation in the past one - year .
but , africa is in urgent needs .
after we moved into the new century , africa is facing numerous challenges in its development . the " african union " was formed to coordinate the affairs of the whole continent such as to achieve the " development objective for 21st century " devised by united nations in 2000 , which calls for reduction in hunger , poverty and to promote health care and education . the " new partnership for african development " was also laid down to promote development in nations but development capital funds are in serious shortage because of the fragile economic base .
the united nations have urged many times for developed countries to use 0.7 % of their gross domestic products as official aids to least developed countries .
yet , u@@ .@@ s . official aids are only 0.1 % of its gross domestic products , which is quite different from the united nations ' request and putting it in the last position on the donor country list .
recently , the public opinions in europe are exploring a popular topic - - is the meeting of the " three magn@@ ates " , german chancellor sch@@ ro@@ eder , french president ch@@ irac and british prime minister bl@@ air , gradually becomes some kind of mechanism ?
public opinions called the " three magn@@ ates " the " three new carts " of european union and the relation between the three countries as the " new tri@@ angle " .
the " new tri@@ angle " is a new thing and what course it is going to take remains to be seen . however , no matter judging from any angle , the " new tri@@ angle " appears to have an overall benefit to the process of uniting europe . hence , it may benefit europe to be a pole in the world 's multi - polarization pattern and also for europe to play a more important role in the international stage .
a review of european history for the past hundred years tells us a fundamental characteristic of the tri@@ angular relation between germany , france and britain : the alliance of britain and france to restrict or resist germany .
the two world wars are the proof .
during the cold war , east and west germany were separated as a member in the war@@ saw pact and the north at@@ lan@@ tic treaty organization respectively .
after the cold war , the united germany became much stronger than before and caused an imbalance of power in western europe . france became suspicious and for a certain time , the " germany - france ax@@ le " ceased to rot@@ ate . this caused france to move closer to britain with an intention to contain germany .
in recent years , the " germany - france ax@@ le " has fired up again but the drastic clashes between unilater@@ alism and multi - polarization in the world has pushed european union into a serious sp@@ ilt on the iraq issue :
the " old europe " led by germany , france and the " new europe " led by britain , poland adopted totally opposite stands in the iraq war problem .
it also happened that the sp@@ ilt occurred at a time when the european union was about to proceed with the biggest enlarg@@ ement in history .
egy@@ ptian president mu@@ barak made a speech on the issue of reform in ar@@ ab@@ ian countries a few days ago in c@@ air@@ o . he criticized the external world for imposing a single reform model to ar@@ ab@@ ian countries . he warned that such attempt may have an exactly opposite effect and is not beneficial to peace and stability in the middle east region .
he believed reform measures have to be based on distinguishing features in a country and countries should proceed with reforms according to their own capabilities . a single reform model ignores cultural background , social customs and religious characteristic in different countries .
he also pointed out that ar@@ ab@@ ian countries welcome external help in their reform processes . however , such efforts must clearly recognize different national conditions and respect the wishes of different countries before such efforts can effectively push ahead the reform processes in ar@@ ab@@ ian countries encompassing politics , economy and culture etc.
the words of the egy@@ ptian leader represent the common view of ar@@ ab@@ ian countries .
at present , middle east is one of the hot spots in the world under the pressure of anti - terrorism , anti - proliferation and democratic reform . it is brewing new unrest and may lead to new integration .
after two wars in af@@ gh@@ anistan and iraq , how should political reconstruction be carried out in iraq , the former " axis of evil " to america ?
what will the changes be in the different system of government and the social model in the middle east region ?
this is not only a concern to the arab world and international community . in fact , the united states and its western allies may also be interested in it .
after a meeting with the visiting crown prince sal@@ man of ba@@ h@@ rain on the 9th in washington , u@@ .@@ s . secretary of state pow@@ ell reiterated u@@ .@@ s . plan to promote " western democracy and capitalism " in iraq and the middle east .
he further stressed that , " we are contempl@@ ating what else can be done and how we can turn all these into systems . "
the international oly@@ mp@@ ics committee designated last year as the " year of education and culture " .
making use of this opportune time , the beijing organizing committee for the games held a series of educational activities to promote advance literacy and popularized the knowledge about the oly@@ mpic games .
among these activities , the publication of a textbook targeted at young readers , entitled " learn more about the oly@@ mpic games for high school students " , is an important achievement .
the textbook is excellent in both pictures and literary compositions . it employs the story - telling approach to make lively and systematic introduc@@ tions about the oly@@ mpic games and the essence of its spirit . it is a good educational material to strengthen young students ' knowledge about the oly@@ mpic games and also help raise the enthusiasm of our society to take part in the oly@@ mpic games .
last year , the beijing organizing committee for the games has also specially designed a timetable for young students , which was made by recycled papers with the beijing oly@@ mpic logo im@@ printed on it .
the theme of " green oly@@ mp@@ ics " is to prepare and host the oly@@ mpic games in accordance with sustainable development concepts , including environmental protection and ecological balance .
just like setting time for lessons , we hope that the timetable can set a standard to the behavior of young students and gradually render them a supporter and promoter of " green oly@@ mp@@ ics " .
education is a core content of the oly@@ mpic games and an important reflection of the " people 's oly@@ mp@@ ics " .
the real objective of the oly@@ mpic games is to promote , from a new angle and using a new style of education , the harmonious development of body and mind of young people such as to make a contribution in the construction of a nice and peaceful world .
hence , the combination of sports and education not only opens a new area for education , but also enhance the significance of oly@@ mpic games in education .
" green oly@@ mp@@ ics " is one of the three themes for the 2008 oly@@ mp@@ ics to be hosted in beijing .
the core content is to greatly improve the quality of the environment in our capital - - create a graceful environment for the oly@@ mpic games and build an ecological city .
to achieve this end , beijing has to adopt a wide range of technology and measures to protect the environment . it is necessary to promote large - scale environmental treatment in every way , including fore@@ station in city and rural areas ; development of environmental protection industries ; enhance conscious of the society in environmental protection ; and encourage active public participation in different activities to improve the ecological environment .
it is important to do a good job in the implementation of " green oly@@ mp@@ ics " in order to push ahead an all - round , coordinated and sustainable development in beijing 's economy and society . this carries through the assertion in the 16th communist party congress for the establishment of a people - oriented , all - round , coordinated and sustainable scientific development .
we must attach high importance to this .
in order to realize the green oly@@ mp@@ ics objective , the beijing city has already compiled " beijing oly@@ mp@@ ics action plan " and " ecology and pollution control plan " on top of the foundation of its " fifteen plan " and " oly@@ mp@@ ics bid report " . these plans set out the new objectives and plans for environmental development and protection work in the next few years .
through systematic and step - by - step implementation , beijing will accomplish the objective of organizing a green oly@@ mp@@ ics .
on february 25 , u@@ .@@ s . state department released the " 2003 country reports on human rights practices " , which , once again , made frivol@@ ous remarks about human right situations in over 190 countries and regions , including china . the tone of the report is just like your " grandfather 's teacher " and says the human right conditions in many countries are no good , in a mess or did not conform to u@@ .@@ s . standard . some other countries are moving backward in crucial areas in human rights etc.
naturally , there are also countries with great improvements in human rights , for example , af@@ gh@@ anistan and iraq . however , these are " achievements " of the u@@ .@@ s . army on over@@ throwing the previous regimes and " liberating " the two countries .
how about the human rights situation in u@@ .@@ s . ?
just like last year , the report has not said one word on that .
on march 1 , the information office of the state council of the people 's republic of china released the " the human rights record of the united states in 2003 " , which complement@@ ed the short@@ coming of the u@@ .@@ s . human rights report .
the article was based on a large number of facts and introduced the human rights problems in u@@ .@@ s . as well as u@@ .@@ s . violations of human rights in other countries .
in history , the people of america have the tradition of honesty and would not hesitate to admit their mistakes .
the young washington who cut a ch@@ erry tree is a lively example that we all know very well .
today , u@@ .@@ s . is the only super power in the world but it does not speak too many honest words any more .
recently , mainstream media in japan have quietly changed their reports on china 's economic development .
contrary to the " china threat " theory before , many reports in japan started to think china 's economic development has pushed ahead japan 's recovery . the vigorous market demand from china is providing significant momentum to japan 's economic development .
u@@ .@@ s . " news@@ week " also said in a recent article that the up - rise of china is an opportunity , not a threat , to other countries , especially to neighbor countries .
the once widely circulated " china threat " theory is gradually replaced by the " china opportunity " theory .
the " china threat " theory says china 's development has become a threat to other countries , especially neighbor countries .
but , china 's neighbors did not accept this provoking assertion .
former malay@@ sian prime minister ma@@ ha@@ thir gave an honest opinion before , " asian countries need not be scared by china 's expanding military and economic power because china never has any tradition to conquer other foreign countries . "
india 's ministry of defense also said in its long - term plan that china has not posed any military threat to india .
in economy and trade , governments and enterprises around the world have taken the chinese market as their best choice for expansion . overseas investors with strategic vision have written the " china opportunity " theory with steady actions : among the top 500 enterprises in our world , more than 400 have invested in china .
for several years , china has been occupying the number one position in the world in terms of amount of foreign capital attracted .
g@@ d@@ p is generally accepted as an important macro economic indicator in our world .
it is of crucial importance that we maintain a growth in g@@ d@@ p throughout the modernization and development process in our nation .
judging simply from the fact that one percent growth in our g@@ d@@ p these days could create corresponding employment for eight hundred thousand people , we have to maintain a fast growth trend in our economy .
to a very great extent , the magnificent objective of building a full - scale fairly prosperous society and the realization of the third strategic framework of modernization rely on a sustained high growth in g@@ d@@ p .
nevertheless , we can visu@@ alize the g@@ d@@ p indicator also has many defects .
for example , it does not precisely reflect the quality and structure of the economic growth . it does not reflect the level of social benefits actually enjoyed by people . it also does not measure resources allocation or social justice in our society , etc. etc.
in addition , g@@ d@@ p is also not the only indicator .
when we assess achievements of the governing process , we cannot simply confine ourselves to g@@ d@@ p growth . we need to look at the level of material and culture life actually enjoyed by people . we have to check the unemployment rate in the area , social security , social justice , social order , social administration and social harmony etc. etc.
therefore , we have to use scientific spirit , scientific attitude and scientific thought to deal with the existing computation system for g@@ d@@ p and properly position the g@@ d@@ p indicator within the overall development of our society .
we need to maintain a certain growth rate but not putting too much emphasis on that . we cannot adopt a one - sided view and pursue it painstakingly .
since a delegation of security council visited six nations in western africa last june , the development in the overall situation of the region have been encouraging , despite some complications in specific countries .
we are glad to note that the government of si@@ erra le@@ one has improved the capability of their army and police ; has a better control on its diamond industry ; and has achieved positive progress in organizing local election etc. the united nations mission in si@@ erra le@@ one is also gradually sc@@ aling down as planned .
it is even more gratifying to note that liber@@ ia is gradually breaking away from the impact of chaos caused by a prolonged war following the deployment of the united nations mission in liber@@ ia . the country starts to head for revival and reconstruction .
the political affairs in the republic of gu@@ ine@@ a bis@@ sa@@ u have also achieved positive progress and the transitional government undertook to hold election for legislators in march this year .
after some setbacks to the peace process in republic of co@@ te d 'i@@ voire , a favorable turn has emerged and all related parties agreed to carry out the " lin@@ as - mar@@ cous@@ sis accord " . the new forces announced its return to the national reconciliation government and the security council is studying the issue of dispatching peacekeeping troops to the country .
we look forward to an early decision by the security council .
the secretariat , the economic community of west african states and the related parties are also striving to solve , on a regional basis , cross - border problems of small arms , merc@@ en@@ aries and use of children as soldiers etc. and have achieved positive fruitful results .
as we approve the aforesaid progress , we should realize the overall situation in western africa is still fragile because of border and historic factors . countries in that region are closely connected and situations often affect each other . the instability in one country may spread to its neighbors or even the whole region .
therefore , as recommended in the security council report , the international community , inclusive of the security council , must adopt an integrated and all - round strategy to solve the western africa problem . a lot of efforts have to be spent to solve cross - border problems and assistance should be extended to related countries , regional and sub - regional organizations like african union and the economic community of west african states etc. in order to improve their ability to prevent and resolve conflicts .
we have a common understanding - - children are the future of the world .
we have obligations to create the best and most suitable condition to facilitate their living and learning such that they grow up , become mature and succeed .
however , it is regrettably that there are still thousands and tens of thousands of children injured in armed conflicts in today 's world .
they have gone through turmoil and backwardness . they observed violence and destruction . they were subjected to injury and abuse . they felt sorrow and helpless .
therefore , protection of children from armed conflicts is an important duty of the international community .
every country , especially those involved in conflicts , should strive to do so .
we are glad to see the united nations (@@ un@@ ) has adopted a series of measure to protect children in armed conflicts and achieved positive results .
the security council has passed a series of four resolutions , including 12@@ 61 ( 1999 ) , 13@@ 14 ( 2000 ) , 13@@ 79 ( 2001 ) and 14@@ 60 ( 2003 ) , providing an important framework for the protection of children .
in peacekeeping missions undertaken by un in some regions , peace@@ keepers have taken protection of children as an important part of their job and children protection consultants are often appointed . peacekeeping work has taken into full consideration the special needs of children throughout the process of assisting the country in question to dis@@ arm , decom@@ mission and return people to society .
some of the peace con@@ cord promoted by un or with un participation also contain clauses for the protection of children .
national reconciliation is an important condition for sustained peace and stability in a region after conflicts .
when conflict stops , but related parties cannot throw away the past resentment and let by@@ g@@ ones be by@@ g@@ ones , then the peace situation cannot be strengthened and new conflict could also be ignited again .
in many situations , it needs the joint efforts of all parties involved as well as the assistance and support from international community , especially the united nations , before national reconciliation can be realized .
for many years , united nations played a useful role in assisting the peace process and national reconciliation in many countries after conflicts and has accumulated a lot of experience . in general , we believe united nations should properly deal with the following three areas before it can successfully help countries with conflicts to achieve peace and reconciliation :
it is necessary to give consideration to short term needs and long term targets .
national reconciliation usually has to go through a certain process and cannot be done in one day .
there should be different focal points in different phases .
to promote reconciliation , the first thing is to let warriors say " goodbye to weapons " and create a safe environment .
in this phase , it is important to put forth efforts to remove arms from former military personnel , discharge them and merge them back into the society .
we are glad to see the situation in bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina is stabilizing day by day . tensions among different nationals continue to alleviate ; reconstruction of economy started to show results ; the work to settle refugees has basically completed ; and the relation with neighboring countries continued to improve .
every one is gratified because the peace process in bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina is not easily won .
we would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the government and the people of bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina . we sincerely hope that all parties in bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina can push ahead the peace process unceasingly and put in more efforts to further improve mutual trust and cooperation .
we also notice at the same time that the capability of institutions at state level in bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina still needs further improvements , especially in areas like judiciary and police etc. , but the reform is facing some challenges .
we believe it is appropriate for senior - level representatives to take this as a weight - bearing point in their work in the first half of this year . we support the government of bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina to work positively and in harmony with senior - level representatives .
we believe with the help of international community , the people of bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina will achieve new developments in their long journey to construct their own country . we wish they could achieve autonomous development at an early date and then , realize the target of joining the unified europe .
the peace and stability in bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina has an important meaning to the enduring peace and development in that region .
china has followed with interest the development in bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina all the time and will work together with international community . china will also continue to make its contribution to help bosnia and her@@ z@@ egovina in economic development and realize long - term peace and stability .
china admires the counter - terrorism committee 's efforts to carry out the united nations 13@@ 73 ( 2001 ) resolution and its contribution to strengthen the anti - terrorism capability in developing countries . china supports the strengthening of coordination and cooperation between counter - terrorism committee ( the " committee " ) and related international , regional and sub - regional organizations in its fight against international terrorism .
at the same time , we hope the counter - terrorism committee can strive to satisfy the actual demand of developing countries and improve the level of aid in its course of work against terrorism .
at present , the issue of revival of the counter - terrorism committee has aroused the attention of a large number of member nations .
after repeated discussions , the counter - terrorism committee submitted an official report as a document for distribution by the security council .
after the committee was put to work for over two years , the existing structure and operating method of the counter - terrorism committee have clearly showed some shortcomings . for example , the report burden to member countries is too heavy . there were too many meetings and documents . there was insufficient coordination between experts and the results of the committee 's work need improvement .
therefore , we totally support the necessary reform to the counter - terrorism committee . we agree with the basket of solutions recommended in the report , including the set up of an executive committee of the counter - terrorism committee . furthermore , we hope existing problems can be solved properly in the shortest possible time frame , especially the problem of excessive report burden to the vast number of member countries .
in here , i wish to stress that revival and reform is a continuous process . irrespective of the approach to the reform , the counter - terrorism committee should provide policy guidance and direction to the executive committee . any strategic decision must be made in unanim@@ ity after discussions in a meeting comprised of the entire counter - terrorism committee .
in recent years , international community is closely monitoring the small arms problem .
this indicates different sides have recognized the over accumulation and illicit trafficking of light weapons endanger the stability , post - war reconstruction and social development in related regions and countries .
it is gratified to note united nations has adopted a series of actions to resolve this problem .
the " firearms - trafficking protocol " annexed to " united nations convention against transnational organized crime " and the united nations " program of action " for small arms and light weapons were reached in 2001 .
these provided a legal and policy basis to properly deal with the small arms problem and sign@@ ified the determination of international community to combat illicit trades in small arms .
in the past three years , international community has made significant progress in pushing forward the " firearms - trafficking protocol " and the implementation of " program of action " . in 2003 , united nations successfully convened the first bi@@ ennial meeting on small arms and has provided new moment@@ ums to continue a full scale , realistic implementation of " program of action " .
the current session of general assembly passed the 5@@ 8/@@ 2@@ 41 resolution and decided to set up a work group to discuss an international instrument to identify and trace small arms . this is no doubt another step forward by international community to combat illicit small arms trades .
similarly , the security council is also attaching more importance to the small arms problem and has held several special topic discussions including the adoption of a chairman declaration and resolution .
not only this , the security council has also stressed the importance of dealing with the small arms problem amidst its consideration for a series of problems in the protection of civilians , women and children during conflicts .
economic development and elimination of poverty are the fundamental premises to realize sustainable development .
sustainable economic development is the material foundation for environmental protection and overall progress in our society .
if the question of survival is not solved , development becomes irrelevant and no one can talk about sustainable development .
endeavor to economic advancement and elimination of poverty is developing countries ' only route to sustainable development .
if the poverty problem in developing countries is not solved , it will also be difficult for developed countries to continue their development .
sensible usage of resources and protection of environment are inevitable requirements for realization of sustainable development .
development based on wastage of resources and contamination to environment cannot possibly continue for long .
the supply of natural resources is limited and certainly not inexhaustible but demands continue to increase because of development in our society . if the relation between these two factors is not properly managed , the ecological environment will necessarily deteriorate , which then seriously threatens the existence and development of mankind .
the only route to sustainable development is a recycl@@ e economy , which is based on the foundation of environmental protection and makes the most efficient use of resources .
the ultimate goal of sustainable development is to improve our society across the broad and enhance both the standard and quality of people 's living .
a year ago , the 9th informal asia pacific economic cooperation (@@ ap@@ ec@@ ) leadership meeting took place at the huang@@ pu river@@ side in shanghai . i can still clearly remember the scenes at that time .
today , we gather again at the beautiful los c@@ abo@@ s on the other side of pacific ocean to discuss major programs of economic cooperation in asia pacific .
i am delighted to meet with some old friends again .
i would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to president fo@@ x 's gr@@ acious invitation and m@@ exic@@ o government 's careful arrangement .
in the past year , the globalization trend continues and technology advances with each passing day . all these have brought forth new development opportunities for all nations .
at the same time , the uncertainties in global economic development have increased . some countries and regions , including some members of ap@@ ec , are facing new challenges in their economic development process .
trade protectionism has re@@ surged . it is still a long way before we can have free , fair and impartial trades .
the fight against terrorism is difficult and complicated , which increases non - traditional security considerations .
our world is still not too peaceful .
even though international community is still facing this kind and that kind of problems , and there might also be other unexpected problems here and there in future , but the era of peace and development is irreversible . the wishes of people in all nations to pursue better liv@@ ings have never changed .
the theme of the meeting and the dialogue this time is development , which has a lot of meaning .
development is the foundation for progress in human civilization . it is a crucial factor for the resolution of different problems and contradiction facing our world .
it needs coordinated , balanced and widespread development across the world before ever@@ lasting peace and stability can be achieved in the globe .
we need to have a comprehensive and in depth study on this topic and make concerted efforts to resolve the issue .
the pace of globalization is accelerating and becomes the most conspicuous characteristic of the current economy in our world .
stimulated by globalization , associations among nations and regions have tightened and markets are more opened . the movement of capital , technology and talents becomes swift and widespread . all these bring forth unprecedented opportunities to strengthen international cooperation for mutual development .
meanwhile , globalization also brings forth serious challenges . the gap between south and north has widened . some developing countries are facing the danger of being further margin@@ alized . economic and financial risks have increased and international crimes become more serious . all of these have increased the urgency to start international cooperation to deal with the challenges together .
at a time when opportunities and challenges coexist , we should grasp the opportunities and respond to challenges . we have to put aside minor differences so as to seek common ground . we need to enlarge cooperation and stimulate globalization such as to move towards common development and prosperity .
( international ) flu outbreak in u@@ .@@ s . reaches new high

" they said they went to iraq to show us a sample of democracy .
however , we have seen nothing up till now . "

xinhua news agency , beijing , january 22 ( reporter : sun yu@@ bo ) - in 2003 , china 's estimated total revenue from international and domestic tourism was r@@ m@@ b 48@@ 7.4 billion , down 12.@@ 4 % over previous year but was still better than expected .

( international ) economists see u@@ .@@ s . as biggest winner for a weak u@@ .@@ s . dollar
xinhua news agency , d@@ avo@@ s , switzerland , january 23 ( reporter : li jie and ding x@@ ig@@ ang ) - in the 3@@ 4th world economic forum currently in session at d@@ avo@@ s of switzerland , economists held a special topic discussion on the u@@ .@@ s . dollar 's devaluation trend on the 23rd . some economists forecasted that united states would be the biggest winner on the continual weakness of the u@@ .@@ s . currency .
the majority of the economists at the meeting believed that u@@ .@@ s . officials , including secretary of united states department of treasury jo@@ hn snow , appeared to have abandoned the " strong dollar " policy in recent years .
a weak dollar can provide greater economic development opportunities and creates more jobs , a point most obvious in the manufacturing industry .
at the same time , the devaluation of the u@@ .@@ s . unit renders u@@ .@@ s . products more competitive in domestic and foreign markets , which in turn can help reduce u@@ .@@ s . trade deficit .
however , economists also believed the weak dollar would bring forth negative impacts to u@@ .@@ s .
first , u@@ .@@ s . stock market may continue to track at a low level as the value of different types of investment fall . overseas investors may withdraw their money as they worry about further devaluation of the dollar . second , the cost of imports becomes more expensive , which will eventually lead to erosion of the standard of living in america . third , a massive devaluation might trigger instability in international trade and finance .
in addition , the dollar devaluation also brings forth more serious impact to europe , japan and canada .
europe finds it more difficult to export products after the drop of the dollar , which might endanger the european economy and pushes europe into a full recession .

the promotion of wider application of information technology in all trades and professions is not only a necessity in the reform and improvement of traditional industries but it can also advance the overall market share of china made products and equipment . the efforts will also create hard to come by opportunities for the electronics & information technology industry .
according to introduction , in the pursuit of further development in the electronic & information technology industry and the satisfaction of demands from industries , china must also help build a system with common technological services capability and provides support to solid research companies . through provision of technology standards and testing environment , china can provide key industries with the necessary support and protection in their application of information technology .
at the same time , china should develop businesses in technical services , management consultancy and system integration etc. to this end , china has to support a batch of service providers including system integration services and application services etc. collectively , these efforts can promote the development of a new information services industry .

in exports , the amount of exports to united states was down 9.8 % over previous year but japan 's exports to asia had surged by a massive 12.@@ 9 % .

in imports , due to increases in demand as well as higher prices in energy resources like petroleum and natural gas , japan 's total imports increased by 5 % and amounted to 4@@ 4.@@ 3@@ 202 trillion yen in 2003 , which was also a new record .
after a break of 3 years , japan 's trade surplus had once again exceeded the 10 trillion yen level - a surplus of 10.@@ 23@@ 87 trillion yen in 2003 to be exact , up 3.6 % over previous year .

( international ) w@@ to sends dispute on " by@@ rd subsidy " to arbitration
xinhua news agency , geneva , january 26 ( reporter : li jie ) - the world trade organization (@@ w@@ to@@ ) said on the 26th that it called for a ruling by an arbitration institution regarding the european union and seven other w@@ to members ' demand for sanctions against the united states over the " by@@ rd subsidy "
the demand for sanctions was filed because united states failed to eradicate the " by@@ rd amendment " within the time limit stipulated by w@@ to .
u@@ .@@ s . congress passed the " by@@ rd amendment " in 2000 , which oblig@@ es the u@@ .@@ s . government to distribute revenue from punitive duties on anti - dumping and anti - subsidy cases directly to u@@ .@@ s . companies that were harmed , rather than sending the revenue to u@@ .@@ s . treasury .
european union , japan , and other major u@@ .@@ s . trade partners opposed the u@@ .@@ s . method .
w@@ to finally decided in january 2003 that the amendment violated global trade regulations and demanded u@@ .@@ s . to abolish it before december 27 of that year .
however , u@@ .@@ s . did not comply with the w@@ to ruling .
recently , european union , japan , canada , brazil , india , south korea , m@@ exic@@ o and ch@@ ile applied to w@@ to for an approval to levy additional import tariffs on some u@@ .@@ s . products up to the equivalent amount of u@@ .@@ s . subsidy .
however , u@@ .@@ s . challenged the legality of the complaint and the level of sanction shortly afterwards .
( hong kong , macao and taiwan ) chinese new year sales up ten percent in hong kong
xinhua news agency , hong kong , january 28 - hong kong retail management association said retail sales during chinese new year were satisfactory . according to sources in the industry , sales went up by 10 percent and some shopping malls experienced an increase of 20 to 30 percent .
hong kong retail management association chairman yu p@@ ang chun said mainland china tourists visiting hong kong on an individual basis promoted the spending desire this year and sales were at satisfactory level during the chinese new year . some retailers in jewellery and garment etc. enjoyed a growth of 20 to 30 percent while mainland tourists accounted for about 10 percent of the total turnover .
he said mainland china tourists are clearly stimulating the markets and the average value of purchase charged to their renminbi credit cards amounted to $ 3,000 . some mainland tourists spent as high as $ 10,000 .
in last year , hong kong was affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome and total retail sales dropped by 4 % .

he believed the deflation in hong kong would ease this year .
( international ) den@@ mark proposes new bill to curb immigration
xinhua news agency , stock@@ holm , january 28 - news from cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen : den@@ mark government has submitted a new bill to curb immigration on 28th .
according to the bill , children of immigrants that are born in den@@ mark will not have the right of automatic citizenship .
the proposal is the latest of a series of restrictive immigration measures introduced by the den@@ mark government since r@@ as@@ mus@@ sen , leader of liberal party , took up the office as prime minister in november 2001 .
according to reports , the bill is likely to be adopted by parliament because the liberal party has the support of the right wing d@@ anish people 's party on the issue of immigrants .
the bill requires children of foreigners born in den@@ mark to present natur@@ alization application when they turn adults , just like any other immigrant . they will not have automatic citizenship .
natur@@ alized immigrants will be stripped of d@@ anish citizenship if they commit serious crimes against society .
in the past two years , den@@ mark government introduced a series of restrictive measures to curb immigration including more restrictive requirement on the eligibility of permanent residence permits and eligibility to bring in family members .
since the den@@ mark government does not welcome immigrants , the number of asylum seekers in den@@ mark has dropped from 14,@@ 3@@ 47 in 1993 to 3,500 in 2003 .
as a result , den@@ mark has tarn@@ ished its image as a free society and a def@@ ender of human rights .
the achievement of singapore should not be taken lightly .
despite advancement in technology , i do not believe we can maintain an ideal environment with a higher standard of living , high quality of life , full employment and increasing salaries when people do not work hard , ignoring social discipline or not adapting to changes in our world .
these beautiful things do not come naturally and cannot be obtained easily .
it is only when the entire population understand they must attach most importance to group interest and make difficult compromise and necessary adjustments before all of us can possess a bright future .
what will singapore look like ten or twenty years down the road ?
we all hope that we can foresee the future but the future is difficult to predict .
a lot of factors are beyond the control of singapore .
the development of many matters hinges on situ@@ ational development in our world .
we do not know when problems will arise and , very often , that may involve some kind of luck .
for example , three singap@@ orean traveled to hong kong and contacted the s@@ r@@ as virus . then , this is un@@ foreseeable .
in less than one month 's time from the chinese new year , there were already three serious safety incidents and several dozens of people died each time .
it is really making people sigh@@ ed with regrets given the frequency of occurrence and the serious losses in lives .
several months before these incidents , another several hundred people have died in ch@@ ong@@ qing natural gas pipe bl@@ ow@@ out , several fuel gas explosions in coal@@ mines and other frequent serious traffic accidents .
china is a vast country and densely populated . hence , the probability of a disaster is higher than other countries and several dozens or even several hundred people could easily be killed in any accident . objectively , this is a reality that has no way out .
however , common sense tells us china 's fatal accidents are still far too frequent .
the bulk of these disasters are related to fire , explosion at coal@@ mines , explosion at firecrackers factories and passenger traffic accidents .
this has at least brought out two questions . one , the safety measure in these areas is too weak . two , people have not learned from past tragedies and thus causing similar incidents to take place again and again .
in singapore , there had been a serious fire disaster at one time when the country was enjoying a high economic growth . that bitter experience is still remembered today and it has quickly improved singapore 's safety precau@@ tion in public places .
similarly , china is also situated in a very special period of time when it is experiencing a high economic growth and a major transition in the society .
from time to time , we have heard about the accident of a foreign maid fell to death from buildings while working in our country . the ratio of this number is not ridicul@@ ously high . nevertheless , given m@@ aids are working in a relatively safe environment inside a home , several instances of f@@ elling to death are still inconsistent to the low injury rate for this kind of work .
according to statistics , a total of 99 m@@ aids of different nationalities fell to death from buildings during january 1999 to june 2003 .
behind these numbers are broken families that can no longer wait for the return of a daughter or a mother . these are mis@@ fortunes that could be avoided . hence , it is definitely the direction of our efforts and we must strive to lower the number of such regrets .
according to a public notice released recently by the indonesian embassy , 96 indonesian m@@ aids have died since 1999 while working in singapore and some of them were fallen to death from high - rise buildings .
indonesia government has expressed dissatisfaction many times to accidents involving m@@ aids fell to death . indonesia government has also imposed new regulations several times to exercise more stringent controls over the quality of maid working here in order to protect the safety of m@@ aids . however , the problem is not satisfactorily resolved . as a result , it is inevitably that the maid issue perpl@@ exes the singapore - indonesia relation .
it is certainly bewil@@ dering that the fell to death number for m@@ aids is actually higher than the number of death involving foreigners working in construction sites . therefore , we must consider the issue carefully and investigate deeply into the problem 's background and cause .
mainland china 's world - renowned taiwan expert chen k@@ ong@@ li has recently published a new book , entitled " taiwan observation " .
the book included articles mostly written after the first rotation of political party in taiwan up till chen shui - bian 's proposal of " one country on each side " . these are the author 's observation and thoughts about taiwan 's internal situations and cross - strait relation during the period of " listen to what he [ chen ] says and observe his moves " .
articles written two years ago can only be published two years later . this clearly reflects china 's complicated steps in the review and examination of research articles concerning taiwan . the lengthy process further illustrates the " taiwan observation " is difficult to come by .
for a long time , chen k@@ ong@@ li 's observation and studies on the taiwan issue have always dealt with concrete matters and he seeks truth from facts independent of and un@@ restricted by any subjective political framework . he strives to explore into profound knowledge and penetrating insight that stands head and shoulders above all others .
this characteristic is deeply reinforced in my mind after i read with respect his book .
since the early eighties in the last century , the study of the taiwan problem became a " burgeoning field of study " . different scholars and experts had emerged conspicuously from different research institutions and started to demonstrate their talents .
in overseas countries , people have generally classified mainland 's research institutions on the taiwan issue into the north clique and the south clique .
the stance of the north clique is closer to official thinking and their opinions are usually tougher . during certain phases in history and also in important political events , they are more often to show their hostile and exceedingly pressing stand .
in the south clique , their taiwan research institutions are mostly located on the south side of yang@@ zi river , including shanghai and fu@@ jian etc.
japanese media revealed that prime minister jun@@ ichiro ko@@ izumi 's " academic record " of " two years study in london " is an exaggeration .
japan 's " shu@@ kan post " has verified with the registrar of university of london - - ko@@ izumi attended several classes as a non - credit earning student and stayed there for only nine months . he did not receive any academic degree .
this scandal was widely reported and re@@ published by large and small media across china . the news is most gratifying to the vast majority of compatriots .
indeed , even the prime minister of a country has fabricated academic record to cheat the people of his country .
it is especially shameful when it happens in an " imperialism " country like japan .
however , if we can change our angle , we may be able to see some positive meanings from this scandal .
furthermore , these kind of positive things are very often what we lack and are also what we need to perfect urgently .
in recent years , we have been advocating " integrity " and we want to " forge a government - in - sunshine " , improve the " transparency " of government administration , and respect the public 's " right to know " . however , the reality is still very far from ideal .
try and think . the diploma of a country 's prime minister is " fabricated " . after all , it is really not a very big issue but the fact that it can be revealed and pursued by media does indicate something .
in a country like that , is there still anything that cannot be " in - sunshine " ?
in taiwan 's evening election rallies , different camps usually use tourist buses to pick up a large mass of people to the campaign site . however , the recent trend is that evening rallies of bian - lu have become qui@@ eter than those of lien - so@@ ong .
not long ago , taiwan president chen shui - bian held a campaign rally in a certain northern city . he was shouting " dong su@@ an ( hom@@ on@@ ym of '@@ win an election ' ) " but about half of the crowd in front of the stage did not follow him - - it turns out that most of the crowd have friends invested in mainland china but the three direct links are delayed again and again ; the economic policy does not produce results and many feel uncomfortable .
if there is no accident , judging from different signs ranging from public survey to illegal betting over the election result , the defeat of chen - lu pair can be presumed as the presidential election enters the phase of final countdown .
unless there is an out@@ burst of some explosive circumstances , for example , the pan - blue coalition has a major sp@@ ilt or even more embarrassing scandal , otherwise chen shui - bian , who came to power through secret support of lee t@@ eng - hui , has proven incapable of w@@ ining enough support from the public over the past four years . in fact , the confidence of pan - green supporters was weakened because the pan - green coalition has continuously exposed their inadequacy in the black gold corruption and a series of no - taste roles or performance .
how should beijing look at the situation where pan - blue coalition may regain power again ?
first , we should understand the pan - blue coalition that may regain power is no longer controlled solely by ku@@ om@@ intang ( nationalist party ) but a combination of ku@@ om@@ intang and the people first party . there will be problems of internal tradition and collaboration with local parties .
the current close cooperation during the election period may not necessarily indicate the relation in future .
if they do win the election , they are going to need a lot of time for internal reorganization in order to face the legislative election following he@@ el at the end of the year . this means it is difficult for the lien - so@@ ong regime to make any important changes to the cross - strait relation .
unless they can recognize the improvement of cross - strait relation can help gain some bonus points in taiwan internal politics and are confident that they can create fruitful results in a short period of time . in any event , the most important thing is to be able to let the people of taiwan taste that fruitful result .
given this background , beijing should slow down the unification action and gives the leaders of the " traditional pan - blue coalition " more time to consolidate internal affairs .
it has been more than half of a century since united states ' first nuclear explosion test in new m@@ exic@@ o in july 1945 and two atomic bombs were thrown into japan in august the same year .
the arms race between the two super powers of u@@ .@@ s . and russia had caused the accumulation of nuclear weapons to the extent sufficient for the destruction of the entire world . it is fortunate that both sides recognize the destructive power of a nuclear war and had never pressed the nuclear button .
after the disintegration of soviet union , the world moved into a post - cold war period and the danger of a large - scale nuclear war was basically eliminated .
meanwhile , the danger of nuclear proliferation has not decreased but actually increased .
the proliferation has appeared in two areas .
on one hand , certain countries of medium size or above that possess considerable resources and strength have made every effort to produce or acquire nuclear weapons in order to satisfy their objective to dominate a region , to compete with a neighbor country , to maintain security or for ext@@ ortions in their foreign affairs .
in other cases , certain organizations or groups that are not nations , especially those isl@@ amic extremists with strong hatred to western world , are also making every effort to acquire small nuclear weapons in order to carry out bloody terrorist activities against the west and will not hesitate to harm a large group of innocent civilians .
under such demand , brokers for the purchase or sale of nuclear weapons and the transfer of related technology have emerged and the " nuclear black market " was found and flourishing . this has become an important component of nuclear proliferation in our world at this time .
as a descend@@ ant of the yellow emperor born and brought up in jia@@ hu , hang@@ zhou , i can still remember the rural scenery and the living of the rural population on the south side of the river in the old days .
i finally return to my hometown after separation for years . along the shanghai - hang@@ zhou free@@ way , i found many three - storey buildings built by farmers were embell@@ ishing here and there in those eye filling green color farm@@ lands . however , i saw only very few people working on the land .
this is really amazing to me . for someone born here but has been senti@@ mentally attached to a foreign country far from home , it is difficult to believe this kind of changes .
recently , i feel unexpected and shocked when i saw some report@@ age and on - site survey reports about china 's rural villages on the internet .
it is just beyond ordinary imagination that there are still so many dark sides in china 's rural villages . the chinese peasants are still living in poverty , a difficult and humili@@ ating life without rights .
after on - site survey in the three provinces of an@@ hui , hen@@ an and he@@ bei , the couple of chen guid@@ i is appealing for farmers and they have compiled a lengthy report@@ age , entitled " a survey about chinese peas@@ antry " . the report has brought shock waves to the chinese society .
there were numerous instances of farmers being squeezed by corrup@@ ted officials or even killed . the conclusion that one can draw : we feel an unprecedented shock and secret angu@@ ish when we walk near the chinese farmers . we can see the kind of poverty , crime , helplessness , resistance , silence and sorrow that you can never imagine .
these are words of deep sorrow and extreme grief .
as expected , malaysia prime minister ab@@ dul@@ lah dissolved parliament the day before yesterday and the election for a new government will be held in the near future .
to ab@@ dul@@ lah , this election has a great significance to his political career . to malaysia 's political situation and development trend , the result of this election is also of landmark importance .
ab@@ dul@@ lah took over the leadership from ma@@ ha@@ thir in november last year , in other words , only four months ago .
notwithstanding that , he still decided to dissolve parliament and advance the date of the poll .
this contains at least two types of meaning : one , ab@@ dul@@ lah is satisfied with his own political performance in the past four months and has full confidence with intentions of voters ; second , he wishes to use the poll to consolidate his power base such that he can move out from the shadow of ma@@ ha@@ thir .
without doubt , ab@@ dul@@ lah 's decision to hold a lightning election reflects that he has already completed a comprehensive assessment of the political situation in malaysia .
the current economic situation in malaysia is quite good and it is not likely that the opposition can use this topic to attack the government .
moreover , ab@@ dul@@ lah has adopted some high - profile measures against corruption ever since his took over office , including the arrest and prosecution of former lands and cooperative development minister k@@ as@@ it@@ ah . these moves have won some favorable views and the public are looking forward optimis@@ tically for more actions on anti - corruption .
meanwhile , he has urged to improve the efficiency in civil services , which is another move that inspired people .
since the day european union (@@ eu@@ ) was formed , it has grown up and shaped under strong influence of french politics and culture .
in foreign affairs , eu strives for independence and autonomy . its stance to world affairs and its approach to issues are different from that of united states . this is the direction of eu 's foreign policy and we can see an obvious shadow of france from it .
because of this , international community , including china , russia and ar@@ ab@@ ian countries , wishes to see a rise of eu such that a totally independent force in international relationship can be seen .
we must admit eu has stri@@ ved to follow this direction in its foreign policy since the late eighties .
in december 1992 , the heads of eu have agreed unanimously in the ma@@ a@@ stric@@ ht summit that all member countries will carry out a unified foreign policy such that they can say the same words to outsiders .
however , the " unified foreign policy " faced the first complete defeat when eu had to deal with the bosnia problem two years later .
since the ma@@ a@@ stric@@ ht summit ten years ago , we may say that eu 's foreign affairs have nothing good or unusual to report .
more important , eu 's foreign policy cannot go through major tests in important events .
this is proved by the different stands adopted by member countries in the u@@ .@@ s . - iraq war . it once again revealed the fatal defects of eu politics and that is , eu can be easily split up by another big country and be crushed one by one .
bush announced in white house on february 24 that he supports a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage .
this is an obvious change from his ambiguous stance on the issue in the past several months and represents an important political development in a u@@ .@@ s . election year .
this constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage is a very powerful political weapon in southern united states , an emerging strongh@@ old for re@@ public@@ ans . however , it also has a great negative effect because it is a heavy weight cultural contention nation - wide that sp@@ ilt up public opinion . without doubt , the move will accelerate the polarization of u@@ .@@ s . politics and goes a step further from the freedom school of thought that domin@@ ates the east and west coast .
in the 2000 election , bush has kept on saying that he supports " unity " and is not a " separatist " but obviously his words and deeds are not in accord .
furthermore , the younger generation in u@@ .@@ s . is adopting an increasingly opened stand on the homosex@@ ual issue . bush 's movement may have a short - term effect but could harm the long - term interest of re@@ public@@ ans .
bush 's new offensive in form of " constitutional amendment " may be called a " scor@@ ched earth strategy " for the presidential election this year .
bush is pursuing this tactic because he is sli@@ pping into an increasingly weak position in the " war on terrorism " and the issue of economy - employment . he has no choice but to start a new front line on religion and culture that split domestic opinions .
u@@ .@@ s . is showing a cautious attitude up till now .
that is to say , the maintenance of the current status in taiwan straits can satisfy u@@ .@@ s . long - term objective of having a strategic check and balance on mainland china . therefore , u@@ .@@ s . is trying to avoid political or military conflicts with china because of any encouragement to taiwan independence .
one can easily imagine , u@@ .@@ s . will not comply totally with beijing 's demand and completely eliminate the space for a poll in taiwan . however , based on consideration of its own interests , u@@ .@@ s . may make some warnings in advance .
recently , u@@ .@@ s . secretary of state pow@@ ell has reiterated the u@@ .@@ s . established taiwan policy on his own initiative and expressly stated u@@ .@@ s . stance against taiwan independence .
outsiders have interpreted the declaration of stands as a signal to chen shui - bi@@ en that he should keep things within limits and prevent him from totally possessed by the devil .
some think tanks with governmental background in u@@ .@@ s . have also made some comments recently . u@@ .@@ s . has also sent a large batch of spy ships to the taiwan straits to detect military movements in both sides of the taiwan strait . these actions indirectly indicated u@@ .@@ s . is paying close attention to the status in taiwan strait .
despite u@@ .@@ s . will not comply with beijing 's demand and stop the polls in taiwan , it does indicate from another angle that u@@ .@@ s . is also worrying about the uncertainties in the situation of taiwan strait in this period of time .
any large scale one man , one vote polls , there can only be one type of result - - either chen shui - bi@@ en re@@ news his office by luck or lien chan will re - enter taiwan 's presidential palace .
the worrying part is that it appears all circles in the society of mainland are not psychologically ready for a possible victory of chen shui - bi@@ en because of the imbalance in information dissemination .
if the poll result is not as desire , it may cause beijing to fall into an unnecessary passive situation again .
an old arab proverb says , " a thousand years of tyr@@ anny being better than one day of an@@ archy " .
is this what is worrying the countries in northeastern asia ?
i think the answer is probably yes .
a famous research and development center closed to washington and funded by u@@ .@@ s . government has recently conducted a study to explore the four possible choices against north korea 's nuclear crisis and they are : relationship , st@@ on@@ ew@@ alling , economic sanction and pre@@ emptive strike .
the focus of the study is the position adopted by different countries to these strategies .
furthermore , the study also tries to analyze the threat imposed by north korea 's nuclear weapon plan according to people 's fear in neighboring countries , their belief of a probably nuclear attack and the possible damage .
china and russia feel that the danger of north korea using its nuclear weapon is low or very low but the people of japan and south korea believe the threat is rather high .
all northeastern countries in asia are in favor of maintaining a relation with north korea .
japan supports st@@ on@@ ew@@ alling and some other countries also accept the strategy of st@@ on@@ ew@@ alling under some specific situation .
singapore cares very much about its international ranking and , throughout the year , it keeps on monitoring all kinds of country ranking lists compiled by various u@@ .@@ s . and european institutions .
as we are so often at the top , our interests in these rankings have naturally increased .
however , there is also a lot of trouble for being in the first place in so many areas .
most people in our country feel that if we pay too much attention to rankings , it may indicate our fear of losing . if we emphasize these rankings , it may indicate we are too proud of ourselves .
therefore , people said we should care less for these things and the best thing is to hold oneself alo@@ of from the world .
many people did not care about ranking in the past and hence , an intrigu@@ ing phenomenon has appeared : people do not take " number one in the world " as good news but are more inclined to take it as an embarrassing issue .
nevertheless , the situation has changed completely in the past one or two years .
we started to have doubts about our country 's long - term competitiveness and people in all trades and profession are worrying about the stability of their jobs .
under such doubts , people are no longer talking that generously .
international competition is fierce . if you do not care enough , other people may over@@ take you . when you are first in everything , it becomes easy to fall behind in something .
on the face of it , bush has expressed personal loyalty towards ch@@ en@@ ey . in the re@@ public@@ an governors meeting at the end of last month , bush still pledged in all sincerity and seriousness that ch@@ en@@ ey is the only choice for vice president .
however , he also said in a half jo@@ king way that he has already appointed ch@@ en@@ ey to look for a vice president candidate just like that in 2000 .
the low profile , low key ch@@ en@@ ey has recently appeared frequently in media interviews and denied that he will be replaced .
however , he also left himself a graceful way to back out .
he said if his health becomes a problem or he feels he is a burden to the president , he could understand the difficulty and withdraw on his own .
ch@@ en@@ ey is 63 years old and has suffered four heart attacks .
it is widely rumored that u@@ .@@ s . troops has actually tightly surrounded the master@@ mind of september 11 , os@@ ama . u@@ .@@ s . is waiting for the ripe time to make the easy capture .
the presidential election is to be held on november 2 and the p@@ ent@@ agon is preparing for a good play to take os@@ ama alive in october .
however , a long delay may mean many h@@ it@@ ches . there can be no end of trouble in the future if os@@ ama slips through by chance .
it looks that gi@@ uli@@ ani is a safer tr@@ ump card for bush to win votes .
the cont@@ enders for the 2004 u@@ .@@ s . presidential election have been confirmed : democratic candidate k@@ erry challenges the re@@ public@@ an president bush .
they have both commenced some " warm - up activities " for the november election including advertising campaign and debates etc.
they will probably argue orally and in writing on the three major issues of war , economy and society .
bush believes war has a close relation to u@@ .@@ s . national security . he has sent soldiers to overthrow s@@ addam , fights terrorism and these are all for u@@ .@@ s . security . that is why he keeps on telling americ@@ ans , " we are in the middle of a war " .
k@@ erry will naturally point out bush 's wrong@@ doing of abusing incorrect intelligence on weapons of mass destruction to launch a war against iraq .
on the economic front , k@@ erry thinks bush 's tax cuts benefit the rich but cannot create new jobs .
bush will ask k@@ erry to see : is the economic data in u@@ .@@ s . going up at this time ?
on social problems , if we look at men and women relation , bush opposes same sex marriage , opposes abortion and supports death penalty . k@@ erry also opposes same sex marriage but supports abortion and opposes death penalty .
it is all about how bush and k@@ erry can express their own views on the three major issues and convince voters through advertisement , television and speeches . those are the political shows that the two have to perform in the next 8 months .
however , k@@ erry has more room to show his talent in the area of foreign affairs .
according to statistics , young people who selected to commit suicide are mostly in the age of 15 to 19 , and quite a number of them were actually only 10 - 14 years old .
the general belief is that stress in studies could be a leading factor for children and youth to commit suicide . nevertheless , research discovers that sentimental issues , especially love affairs between male and female , as well as their get along with parents , is the main factor for local youth to commit suicide .
the stress on studies and deviation from expectation are naturally also an area of communication between children and parents .
the stress of moving up to college has been a burden for a long - time to local students during their growth and development period . sometimes , stress is self - imposed but often parents impose the stress to children .
parents demand their children to have good academic results . they frequently compare their children with other children and demand their children to work harder . this will obviously create great stress to children . however , it is really the channel of communication and guidance behind the stress that is the real ther@@ mom@@ eter for measuring parent and children relation .
if a child is not performing as desired and parents beat or sc@@ old the child , use facial expression as a silent re@@ pro@@ ach or even make the child feel guilty of oneself , this will no doubt push the child to a desperate helpless situation .
it is understood that the spiritual distress of many young students requiring counsel was caused by unrealistic expectation of their parents , which pushes students into dead corners .
due to singapore 's success and rapid development , parents feel their children have much better material conditions than themselves . they naturally believe their children should have better performance than themselves .
parents usually forget their own performance in various areas is not that outstanding when they were kids themselves .
at the age of 1 - 1/2 , the majority of our children will be sent to child@@ care centers with full care services . the authority only charges a nominal fee for such service . most children go home only one day in a week or sometimes even one day in a month .
today , singapore is facing the social problem of a low birth rate and an aging society .
the young generation is busy in maintaining their modern living standard and their enjoyment of life - style materialism . they do not even have enough time to take care of themselves . hence , they could not possibly have enough energy to support the government 's call for early marriage and more children .
the author has a bold suggestion : the government should take over all new@@ born children .
citizens of our nation only need to think about giving birth to children but not raising them .
on one hand , the government can operate child@@ care centers and kindergartens of full care style . primary schools can be converted to a full - day system and may even include service for three meals . the government will only charge a nominal fee affordable to our citizens .
this will create jobs for the unemployed in our population and the government need not worry about the effectiveness of different measures like child bonus , increase in duration of maternity leave , the quality of m@@ aids and tax rebates etc.
what beijing needs to do is not only to play a leading role in the six - party talks but also keeps in mind china 's long - term interest in the korean peninsula . it is always better to repair the house before it rains and so , beijing should unfold its strategic deployment as soon as possible .
in specific terms , on one hand , beijing has to urge north korea to abandon its nuclear weapon . on the other hand , it has to induce a reform on kim j@@ ong - il regime and guides north korea to the road of modern civilization . this removes the danger of a nuclear war in northeastern asia and could also become chips for long - term strategic dealings with u@@ .@@ s .
py@@ ong@@ yang is fierce of mi@@ en but f@@ aint of heart . deep inside py@@ ong@@ yang 's mind , it is longing for economic development and the opportunity to blend into international community .
it is only that its wishes are frequently expressed in external forms that are val@@ iant , irrational and sometimes totally against international rules .
in fact for quite some time , beijing has been using its influences and economic aid measures to force py@@ ong@@ yang to change its stand of not complying with international rules .
this kind of action obviously needs an all - round planning .
beijing 's assistance to py@@ ong@@ yang should not be limited to the economic layer but can be extended to other areas in the society . beijing should not limit itself to persuade py@@ ong@@ yang to abandon its nuclear plan but also guide py@@ ong@@ yang to the route of modern civilization .
when jo@@ hn k@@ elly first entered the arena , nobody is betting on him . at that time , all focuses were on former ver@@ mont governor dean .
however , k@@ elly has sudden emerged as a new force before the i@@ ow@@ a caucus in january . he won the primary or caucus in two most critical states in one blow - - i@@ ow@@ a and new ha@@ mp@@ shire .
basically , k@@ elly has not missed in any pri@@ mar@@ ies in other states afterwards . for those states that he missed , it was because those states already had their own candidates .
k@@ elly has only used six weeks and turned from a candidate with almost no future to the final candidate . all of his competitors including g@@ ep@@ hard@@ t , li@@ e@@ ber@@ man , clar@@ k , dean and ed@@ wards have fallen out one by one . people cannot help but to treat k@@ elly 's political char@@ is@@ ma with increased respect .
throughout his 19 years career as a senator , k@@ elly supports abortion and environmental protection . he opposes tax cuts that benefits the rich and strives to raise the minimum wage . he also hopes to solve the global warming issue .
his working experience in washington shows that he is willing to face difficult problems in the society , bold enough to challenge author@@ it@@ ativeness , thorough pursuance of value and is not afraid of offending the interests of a small group of people .
china 's reform and opening policy started from agriculture and rural residents are the early beneficiaries of this policy .
however , the economic policy has le@@ aned greatly towards cities since the n@@ ine@@ ties and the reform in agriculture has come to a stand still . the gap between city and rural areas has widened .
as time progress , there are two different worlds in china . on one hand , we have the highly prosperous cities and on the other hand , the rural villages are backward and in poverty .
using the words of chinese officials , the widening gap between rich cities and poor villages is a " problem during the course of development " . it has to be solved through sustained development .
in other words , china 's coastal regions and cities should continue with development and need not be dragged down by the problem in rural villages .
however , when people see that cities can have a small change in one year and a major change in three years , they cannot help but ask : why is there no change at all in some poor regions over the past several decades ?
of course , the development path for cities and rural villages is quite different . this is a fact that we have to admit . but , the problem is that we have put a large amount of capital into city development . we encourage and support the rich middle class . at the same time , does the rural population , which accounts for 70 % of the nation 's population , receive the care and importance they deserve ?
in theory , we cannot say the past administrations of the chinese government did not attach importance to agriculture , rural villages and farmers .
however , the situation in rural villages has turn worst and becomes increasingly difficult in recent years . this has illustrated the degree of importance attached is clear not enough .
public security , procuratorate and judiciary should be images of fair and justice in any country and is also the most important system to protect social stability .
unfortunately , public security , procuratorate and judiciary have become images of corruption in china .
according to the report by china 's national audit office , the result of an examination on financial expenditures in public security institutions in 26 province / city showed that spending against regulation amounted to r@@ m@@ b 16.5 billion across the nation .
the result makes it open that the distrust in public security , procuratorate and judiciary has reached a crisis state .
the liu yong case , the sun zh@@ ig@@ ang case and the latest " b@@ m@@ w " case in he@@ il@@ ong jiang have all reflected the profound distrust .
the " b@@ m@@ w " incident is a typical case .
the close attention to the case has far exceeded the attention to " s@@ ars " during the " s@@ ars " crisis period because people are so much concerned about the issue .
in fact , people are not caring about the " b@@ m@@ w " incident itself . people are expressing their distrust to the whole judiciary system .
the related departments understand this clearly and they have taken measures to shut up the media soon afterwards .
however , the problem is still there .
the second round six - party talks on korean peninsula nuclear issue has ended in a way as many have expected .
in this meeting , the related parties have made contacts and prob@@ es on surrounding issues to the korean peninsula nuclear crisis . they have also reached the common consensus to set up a working group before the third round of talks , which is to be held before the end of june this year .
however , there was no progress at all in the meeting as to how north korea would abandon its nuclear weapon research program , or how united states would guarantee north korea 's political and military safety after it abandoned the nuclear program , or other practical issue like energy aid etc. in fact , it only gives people the impression that the " deadlock " has been tightened further .
the two important figures - - north korea and united states have not made any concession and the fundamental position of the both sides have not changed a bit .
nevertheless , the conspicuous point is that u@@ .@@ s . does not show any desire for a fast resolution of the problem in this meeting but rather gives people the impression of " dragging " on .
this kind of u@@ .@@ s . policy is obviously related to the latest development in international situations and the benefits that u@@ .@@ s . attempts to gain from these latest developments .
there have never been so many bosses of corporations thrown into jail in america ever since the time when ro@@ os@@ evel@@ t was president .
is this a coincidence or is that the public and investors can no longer tolerate illegal and criminal corporate activities in the last three years and thus , causing these crimes be revealed recently one after the other ?
there is no simple answer to that . however , it is a fact that many illegal corporate activities were revealed recently .
this is good for economic recovery and especially a good sign in the restoration of investor confidence .
the end of the n@@ ine@@ ties may be the most disorderly period in the history of u@@ .@@ s . commerce and also the most difficult phase to understand . hence , the earlier its impact is gone , the better .
once the dust set@@ tles , some corporate names may vanish from history and could only be found in college textbooks in commerce .
new management teams are leading some other companies , for example , ty@@ co and mc@@ i , and they are trying their best to re@@ position themselves to meet the challenges in a new round of economic growth .
but , when will a new round of economic growth arrive ?
as a ce@@ o , you may not have the answer .
this is not important though , because even the chairman of u@@ .@@ s . federal reserve alan green@@ span does not know the answer .
the bush administration is trying to use key@@ n@@ es philosophy to stimulate the economy , which calls for massive increase in spending ( especially in defense spending ) on one hand and massive tax cuts on the other hand .
in international affairs , the bush administration continues to promote free trade but trade deficits have already reached a new high of us $ 5@@ 49 billion .
after the massive tax cuts , investments and consumption did not show any remarkable growth .
the new key@@ n@@ es school of thought represented by famous british economist , w@@ y@@ me god@@ ley , believe u@@ .@@ s . economy is m@@ ired in difficulties and bush 's fiscal and economic strategy is unable to save the situation .
they believe the so - called " market discipline to command " is only an illusion which inevitably benefits a few while putting the vast majority into an unfavorable situation .
in the past , most people believe the benefited in our world are a few in u@@ .@@ s . while those in an unfavorable situation are the vast number in developing countries .
nowadays , that is not the fact .
apart from those multinational companies based in u@@ .@@ s . , many u@@ .@@ s . economists believe that india and china are the notable winners in the current globalization process .
india domin@@ ates the service economy sector while china domin@@ ates the manufacturing area .
while people concentrate their attention on the phenomenon of massive shift in u@@ .@@ s . capital and production equipment to china , they fail to see the advantage of a high quality , low - income labor market in china .
first , is the current situation in taiwan within or outside the expectation of beijing ?
obviously , beijing 's expectation is only known to beijing itself . however , other people can deliberate beijing 's assessment results using other public information .
in the past four years , the camp led by chen shui - bian and lu hsiu - lien has been actively promoting taiwan independence using clear - cut language and ruth@@ less efforts .
to the contrary , beijing has only made occasional protests but , other than that , its response became quite a routine procedure and appeared indifferent to the progress of taiwan independence .
since autumn last year , the situation suddenly changed completely . it appears as if a cow cart has suddenly turned into a motor@@ car . over the past few months , its handling capability is obviously different from that in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
based on this , we can speculate the current situation in taiwan is within beijing 's expectation .
second , we can look at foreign affairs involving taiwan .
regarding the situation in taiwan strait , we need to see whether the position of major countries , for example , united states etc. is closer to beijing or closer to tai@@ pei .
the stands of these countries are opened and clear . therefore , the answer is obvious .
up till now , these countries are getting closer to beijing and have more specific associations . on the other hand , these countries are getting further away from tai@@ pei and specific associations are fewer than before . furthermore , some " sincere words and earnest wishes " started to appear to the much - praised democracy in taiwan .
