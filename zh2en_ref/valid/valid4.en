Two Laptop Computers Containing Investigative Material on Cause of Death of Princess Diana Stolen 
From London on the 6th , AFP 
The London Daily indicated that two laptop computers containing investigative materials on the 1997 Paris car accident and death of Princess Diana were stolen from the office of the former commissioner of the Metropolitan Police . 
The report indicates , this case of larceny has created conjecture among people that these computers might have confidential material from the investigation lead by Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Stevenson hidden on them . 
However , a spokeswomen from the Metropolitan Police Bureau indicated that these computers in fact do not have any sensitive information , or material concerning the investigation . 
Lord Stevenson is the Bureau Head of England 's Northumbria Police Department , his office is situated along the Tyne River and Newcastle . 
The report states that officials of the Northumbria Police Department have been investigating these two cases of larceny over the last 10 days . 
One case happed between on the weekend vacation of January 28 to 29 , and including computers and money being taken ; the second case happened the previous week , but did not result in any losses . 
The Northumbria Police Department also expressed that there is no evidence to indicate that these two larceny cases are connected to Lord Stevenson 's work . 
Stevenson has been investigating that Princess Diana 's cause of death was not a direct result of a car accident . 
Royal Coroner Burgess gave the order to continue investigations into relevant evidence in 2004 . 
Princess Diana lost her life in a car accident in a tunnel in Paris on August 31, 1997 , both her lover Fayed and the driver died with her . 
After a two year investigation , French Police believe that this tragedy was caused by the driver driving the car too fast and losing control while drunk and after using drugs .

From Colombo on the 7th , AFP 
Norway , the mediator in the peace process , expressed that Sri Lanka 's fighting sects agreed to open talks on the 22nd of this month in Geneva , Switzerland , neutralizing the three - year impasse in talks seeking to resolve this bloody racial conflict between the two sides that has been going on for several decades .

The two days of talks will be focused on how to strengthen the ceasefire agreement that came into effect on February 23, 2002 ; this agreement has not been fully adhered to by either side . 
The Norwegian Embassy pointed out , " both parties will discuss how to improve the implementation of the ceasefire agreement ; this is also the first time that both parties have carried out face to face talks at such a high level in three years .

From Turin Italy on the 10th , AFP 
The 20th Winter Olympics held its opening ceremony today in Turin ; the delegations of both North and South Korea , who where mutual enemies during the cold war , entered the Stadium together hand in hand during the ceremony . 
South Korea 's women 's speed skater Bora Lee and North Korea 's men 's figure skater Han Jong - in , respectively , were the flag holders for the two countries ' delegation , and led the South and North Korean delegations into the Winter Olympics Stadium . 
This is the first time that the North and South Korean Olympic delegations jointly entered the stadium holding hands for a Winter Olympics . 
To reflect the conciliatory spirit of union that has been built over the past several years , the North and South Korean delegations jointly entered the stadiums during the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics and the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics . 
North Korea did not participate in the 19th winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City , USA . 
The Korean peninsula split into capitalist South Korea and communist North Korea in 1948 ; the two countries were set against each other during the Korean War from 1950 to 1953 . 
After South and North Korean leaders held the 2000 peace summit , the relations of both parties turned for the better . 
According to tradition , the Greek delegation is the first country to enter the stadium ; among the 80 countries participating in the competitions , South Korea was the 22nd country and North Korea was the 23rd country to enter the stadium . 
Host country Italy was the last country delegation to enter the stadium ; once the Italian team entered the stadium , enthusiastic shouts and round after round of applause immediately sounded . 
Hoffman Once Wallowed in Clutches of Drugs , Fortunately Awaking in Timely Manner to Begin Acting Career 
From New York on the 16th , AFP 
Actor Philip Seymour Hoffman of the film " Capote , " widely regarding as having the best hope of taking this year 's Oscar , revealed that when he was young and wild he wallowed in the clutches of drugs and alcohol with no way to escape ; luckily he later succeeded in rehabilitation , allowing him to begin the peak of his acting career . 
Hoffman sighed when doing an interview with America 's CBS news magazine " 60 minutes " that during that period he truly used whatever means necessary to obtain drugs and alcohol . 
At the time he was just over 20 , and had just graduated from the drama department of New York University when he entered into a rich and varied society ; the pace of everyday life revolved rapidly , finally revolving until his head swelled and spun , and he lost control . 
When he was 22 years old he entered a drug rehabilitation clinic and got rid of his habits of heavy drinking and popping pills there ; that was the most panic stricken period of his life . 
In the fast approaching Oscar Awards Ceremony to be held next month , Hoffman interprets the character of American writer Capote in the movie " Capote , " and is considered the favorite to take home the award for best actor . 
Long before this , his exquisite acting had already been confirmed , as he had already received the confirmation via many awards , including a Golden Globe for best actor . 
This 38 - year - old actor expressed during the interview that if he did not make the painful decision to change his bad habits before becoming famous , he probably wouldn 't have received a nomination for an Oscar . 
He said that he greatly admires those 19 - year - old rich and beautiful actors who become famous all at once . 
Traces of Bird Flu Appear in Europe Four Times , People in Nigeria in State of Anxiety 
From Brussels on the 16th , AFP 
Traces of the Bird Flu have continuously been appearing in Europe , creating fear and trepidation among the people . 
The EU Executive Committee , by bringing all areas of countries in which the virus was discovered under management and prohibiting all fowl from being traded and transported , has once again established a " buffer area " management system . 
The 8th day after discovering the deadly H5N1 virus in the African country of Nigeria saw the epidemic continually spread to more chicken farms ; the indicators show that it has already jumped across the northern border and entered Niger . 
An Egyptian official is currently investigating a southern chicken farm that saw groupings of sudden deaths ; they worry that the virus will likely continue to spread . 
The chicken markets of Europe have felt the influence of the virus and have fallen by a large scale ; the European Union executive committee has emphasized that there is really no reason for panic . 
Kyprianou , the commissioner responsible for Health and Consumer Protection on the Executive Committee , expressed that the populace being concerned with these events can be understood , but that there is no need for over - response . 
Following previous regulations of a three - kilometer protection area and a 10 - kilometer warning area around spots where the virus is discovered , the EU Executive Committee has come out with new regulations , making all European areas discovered with the virus " buffer zones . " 
One EU official who was not willing to give his name pointed out that everybody is very nervous ; every day they are handling news about suspected outbreaks of the epidemic coming in from many places in Europe . 
As of now the European region has seen traces of the H5N1 virus appear in the European territory and other locations of Austria , Bulgaria , Croatia , Germany , Greece , Italy , Romania , Slovenia , Ukraine and Russia , with nearly all cases being discovered in wild swans . 
Romania discovered 31 cases of the virus on the 16th ; Slovenia , Austria , Greece and the German island of Rugen have all seen the appearance of new cases of the virus . 
In southern Italy the bird flu virus was discovered on the bodies of two ducks , which is the first case of infection of an animal with the H5N1 virus that was not a swan . 
Currently , what EU officials are most worried about is the seasonal birds that will soon be flying back from Africa . 
The Nigerian government is currently strengthening its efforts to prevent the virus from spreading to humans on the African mainland . 
The Nigerian government has announced that all fowl in the neighboring five - kilometer circumference of any farm that has been affected will all be culled , regardless of whether or not they have been menaced by the virus . 
The government of neighboring country Niger announced that the entire nation has entered a state of alert , and brought up a USD 4 million emergency plan to monitor the border with Nigeria . 
The newly established National Emergency Committee expressed that they have received reports that in the area of Magaria , where the watch is lax between the two countries , nearly 400 birds have died . 
Now let 's take a look at the Iranian nuclear issue . 
The International Atomic Energy Agency verified on the 6th that the Iranian government had sent a letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency demanding that it dismantle and remove all equipment monitoring Iran 's nuclear facilities by the middle of this month . 
Because the International Atomic Energy Agency decided to report the Iran nuclear issue to the United Nations Security Council , Iran has announced the termination of all support and cooperation measures it had adopted with respect to the nuclear issue , and it will not longer permit the International Atomic Energy Agency to perform surprise inspections of its nuclear facilities . 
Targeting the current tense situation with respect to the Iranian nuclear issue , Russian foreign minister Lavrov said on the 6th in Athens that the cooperation between Russia and Iran still exists . 
This will become the driving force in the resolution of the Iran nuclear issue . 
On the same day , a spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Russia 's proposal to Iran to establish a joint uranium enrichment enterprise within Russia 's borders was still effective . 
The two parties could engage in negotiations concerning this issue next week . 
On the same day , at United Nations headquarters in New York , Senator Lugar , chairman of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said that the United States does not approve of Israeli attacks of Iran 's nuclear facilities . 
According to recent reports , Israeli defense experts have said that , if necessary , Israel could severely damage Iran 's nuclear facilities . 
Xinhua News Agency reports that on the 7th , Russian deputy foreign minister Kislyak said Russia is willing to cooperate with Iran regarding the nuclear issue and help Iran obtain the legal authority to peacefully develop nuclear energy . 
Kislyak said that Russia 's proposal to Iran to establish a joint uranium enrichment enterprise with Iran remains valid . 
Russia hopes to hold negotiations with Iran concerning this issue in the near future . 
At the end of December last year , Russia submitted a proposal to Iran that the two countries establish a joint uranium enrichment enterprise within Russia 's borders . 
The European Union and the United States both said that they could accept this compromise proposal . 
But Iran hopes Russia will continue to revise the original plan . 
On the 7th , Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Kong Quan said that although the International Atomic Energy Agency had reported the Iran atomic energy problem to the United Nations Security Council , it had not transferred the agency 's responsibility to handle the Iranian nuclear issue to the Security Council . 
Therefore , the various parties must still break the deadlock over the Iran nuclear issue within the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency . 
According to a resolution of the International Atomic Energy Agency , International Atomic Energy Agency General Director Baradei will deliver a report concerning the Iran nuclear issue to the Security Council in March . 
After evaluating this report , the Security Council will make a final decision . 
We feel that this resolution mentions requiring Iran to , uh , fulfill the relevant Security Council resolutions and the promises it has made , and has not submitted or transferred this problem to the Security Council . 
For some time recently , China has sought a peaceful resolution to the Iran nuclear issue through diplomatic means . 
Kong Quan said that on February 1 , Zhang Yan , Director - General of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Department of Arms Control and Disarmament , held talks in Tehran concerning the Iran nuclear issue with Lalijiani , negotiating representative of the Secretariat of the Supreme Security Council of Iran . 
The Chinese hope Iran will attach importance to the international community as the key to creating conditions for a peaceful resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue . 
Resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue within the IAEA framework is not only in China 's interests ; moreover , we firmly believe that it is in the interests of all parties . 
To this end , we once again call on the concerned parties in the international community to not abandon the diplomatic efforts made regarding this issue . 
Hamas , which is currently in the process of forming the new Palestinian self - rule government , has announced that , with the exception of the prime minister , the nominees for the new government 's cabinet are essentially in place . 
This has triggered all manner of speculation among outsiders concerning the selection of the prime minister . 
On the 8th , a senior Hamas official disclosed to the Associated Press that Hamas was prepared to nominate ( ( businessman ) ) Khudari , chairman of the board of trustees of Islamic University in Gaza , but this nomination has yet to be formally submitted to Abbas . 
With the support of Hamas , Khudari , who is now 51 , participated in Palestine 's parliamentary election last month as an independent candidate . 
Khudari has never mentioned violence or opposition to Israel in his public speeches . 
But he has said that Palestine must engage in internal reform . 
A high - level Hamas delegation is currently visiting Cairo to discuss the issue of Hamas ' formation of the new Palestinian Authority government . 
On the 8th , Khaled Masha 'al , a member of the delegation , told the press that despite the constant pressure from the international community and certain Arab countries , the Palestinian government formed by Hamas leaders would not recognize Israel . 
At the same time , Masha 'al warned Abbas in his statement : do not arbitrarily change the structure of Palestinian leadership without consulting Hamas in advance . 
Analysts believe that this was in response to Abbas ' plan to appoint interior minister Yousef as deputy commander of security forces . 
And concerning the issue of the formation of a new Palestinian self - rule government , Masha 'al declined to verify the news that Hamas was preparing to nominate ( ( businessman ) ) Khudari , chairman of the board of trustees of Islamic University in Gaza to serve as the prime minister . 
Masha 'al said , " The nominee for prime minister has yet to be determined . " 
Prior to Masha 'al 's reiteration of the refusal to recognize Israel , in an Egyptian television interview , Ma 'erzuke , another Hamas political leader , said , " Hamas will absolutely not recognize the legal status of Israel , but the new government will continue have contacts with Israel in a variety of areas . Because whether or not one recognizes Israel and whether or not one has dealings with it are two different matters . " 
Setting aside the new animosity and old grudges toward Israel of the three Hamas nominees for prime minister , territorial issues have always been a sticking point in Palestinian - Israeli relations . 
In an interview with Israeli television channel 2 on the 7th , Ehud Olmert , acting prime minister of Israel , said that Israel must be separated from Palestine through the delineation of a permanent border . 
This implies that Israel will have no choice but to withdraw from some of the territory on the west bank of the Jordan River . 
However , Olmert stressed that Israel will continue to control large Jewish settlements on the west bank of the Jordan and the Jordan River Valley area , and will preserve the integrity of Jerusalem . 
All right , welcome everyone to the Chinese news program . 
China 's consulate in Karachi verified on the 15th that three Chinese engineers and one Pakistani driver were attacked and killed in Balochistan in southwestern Pakistan . 
Upon learning of the matter late last night , Chinese president Hu Jintao expressed a high degree of concern for the safety of Chinese engineers and technicians in Pakistan . 
He directed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese embassy in Pakistan to demand that the Pakistani authorities apprehend the perpetrators and ensure the safety of Chinese personnel in Pakistan , and to handle the final affairs of the deceased appropriately . 
Hu Jintao also expressed deep grief for the personnel who were killed and his sincere condolences to the families of the victims . 
In the early morning hours today , following president Hu Jintao 's instructions , foreign minister Li Zhaoxing spoke with Kasuri , Pakistan 's minister of foreign affairs . 
China 's embassy in Pakistan immediately activated emergency mechanisms , and concerned personnel have already rushed to the scene . 
Premier Wen Jiabao also issued instructions with respect to ensuring the safety of Chinese personnel , handling the final affairs of the deceased and demanding that Pakistan apprehend the assailants . 
Additionally , according to the latest news from the Chinese consulate in Karachi , the bodies of these three Chinese were already moved to Karachi early this morning , and will be shipped back to China by special airplane within the next several days . 
After the attack , the Chinese consulate in Karachi quickly dispatched a three - person team to the scene of the incident , and the bodies of the three Chinese engineers were moved to a hospital in Karachi for storage . 
At the same time , a dozen or so Chinese personnel who work at the same work site as these people have been withdrawn to Karachi , and their emotions are now stable . 
The attack occurred in a town called Hub in southeastern Gawadar . 
That afternoon , six Chinese engineers who worked at a local cement factory boarded a van and were about to return from the worksite to their residence when they were intercepted by an unidentified hoodlum riding a motorcycle . 
The hoodlum fired a submachine gun , and three of the engineers were killed . 
After the attack , a tribal paramilitary organization called the " Balochistan Liberation Army " claimed responsibility for it . 
That night , Pakistan 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement strongly condemning the attack , and claimed that it was an act of terrorism . 
The three Chinese who were killed were Long Hongbao , Wei Jianping and Zhao Bin , technical personnel from the Hefei Cement Industry Design Institute , a subsidiary of China National Building Material Group Corporation . 
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Qin Gang said today that national leaders in China were highly concerned about the attack on Chinese engineering and technical personnel in Pakistan , and were demanding that Pakistan ensure the safety of Chinese personnel in Pakistan and apprehend the assailants as quickly as possible . 
Qin Gang said that China 's ambassador to Pakistan , Zhang Chunxiang , had reported the relevant situation to Pakistani state and military leaders , and had formally taken up the matter with them . 
Pakistan strongly condemned this barbaric and savage incident , expressed grief over the unfortunate deaths of the Chinese employees , and said that they would do everything possible to apprehend the assailants , cooperating fully with Chinese authorities to handle the matter . 
The Ministry of Foreign affairs is coordinating with the concerned departments to arrange for the bodies of the deceased to be returned to China as quickly as possible . 
A team to handle the final affairs formed by the unit that dispatched the deceased , Hefei Cement Industry Design Institute , a subsidiary of China National Building Materials Group Corporation , left Beijing for Pakistan this morning . 
After the incident occurred , the Ministry of Commerce also established an emergency response team . 
Assistant Minister of Commerce Chen Jian said that if safe operations could not be guaranteed for the time being , work could not begin on the cement factory construction project . 
Only when the safety of construction personnel could be guaranteed would work continue . 
After the ( ( emergency response ) ) team was established , we immediately , uh , instructed people at the front to rush to the front lines where the incident occurred to investigate and study the local situation . 
At the same time , we in China verified the identities of the deceased within the shortest time possible . 
Chen Jian said that the Ministry of Commerce would keep a close eye on the handling of the matter , and actively coordinate with the concerned units to handle the final affairs . 
If safe operations cannot be guaranteed for the time being , we will require Chinese enterprises to cease operations . 
When safe operations are realistically guaranteed , we will resume work again . 
Implementation of the Attock cement factory line B project began in 2004 . 
The Hefei Cement Industry Design Institute is responsible for supplying a full set of equipment for the cement factory as well as technical services , and is projected to finish work in the first half of 2006 . 
The bodies of the three Chinese engineers who died in an attack in Pakistan began their journey from Karachi back to China on a special Pakistani air force flight at 7:00 a.m. local time this morning . 
Let 's watch the report filed by our correspondent in Pakistan , Tao Ye . 
The bodies of the three Chinese engineers killed near Karachi on the 15th began their journey back to China from Karachi 's Faisal air force base on the morning of the 17th . 
The atmosphere at Karachi 's Faisal air force base in the first rays of the morning sun was very solemn . 
China 's ambassador to Pakistan , Zhang Chunxiang , the director of the internal affairs department of Sind province , where Karachi is located , and China 's consul general to Pakistan , Sun Chunye , led Chinese consular personnel in Pakistan and employees from Chinese companies to give their departed compatriots a final sendoff . 
Led by ambassador Zhang Chunxiang , all of the people on site bowed three times in front of the three caskets . 
Then , soldiers from the Pakistani honor guard slowly moved the caskets onto the special plane provided by the Pakistani air force . 
Chinese and Pakistani personnel at the site made a circle around the airplane , then watched as their departed Chinese compatriots left . 
The plane took off from the air field at around 7:20 a.m. 
This plane will make a brief stop in the Pakistan capital of Islamabad . 
Senior Pakistani government officials will board this , uh , this special flight , which will fly from Islamabad to Hefei , China on the same day . 
This plane ( ( is projected ) ) is projected to arrive in Hefei , China this evening , Beijing time . 
It is anticipated that the special plane transporting the bodies of the three victims will arrive in Hefei at around 10:00 this evening . 
Now let 's connect with our reporter at the Hefei Luoguang Airport , Li Guangyu . 
Hello Li Guangyu , give us a report on the situation at your end . 
Greetings , anchor . 
We remain unclear as to the specific time that the plane from there will land at the airport here . 
What we do know now is that at 5:30 this afternoon , that plane from Pakistan landed at the Urumqi airport , and they were transferred to another plane from Urumqi to Hefei . 
Arrival is estimated at around 11 or 12 o'clock tonight . 
As to the specific kind of ceremony to take place when the bodies arrive tonight , and what people will appear , uh , we are still not very clear . 
So , we now know that this afternoon , the provincial government and , uh , relevant personnel from the , uh , cement design institute have held some coordination meetings , uh , to coordinate some of the content for tonight . 
Uh , now , their work unit , uh , in the last two days , the chairman of the labor union of the cement institute over here , uh , has established a consolation team , which has continually been doing consolation work in the homes of the victims . 
As for the specific compensation figure , we still have no definite , certain answer . 
Uh , we do know that one of the insurance items is 400,000 in accidental injury insurance . 
Uh , the families have yet to contact insurance companies directly concerning claims ; rather , the work unit has stepped forward to make inquiries with the claims processing company and the , uh , insurance company concerning the processing of claims . 
Uh , this is the situation as I understand it at present . 
All right , thank you , Li Guangyu , for your onsite report . 
Additionally , Yuan Fengning , Xue Jijun and Yang Wei , who were fortunate to survive the terrorist attack on February 15 , and other personnel from the Hefei Cement Research and Design Institute who were stationed in Balochistan , Pakistan , returned by plane to Hefei . 
When the plane carrying the three survivors and the eleven other employees arrived in Hefei , the people waiting at the airport breathed a sigh of relief . 
I feel that being able to return safely , I feel very relieved . 
And our country is very ( ( ) ) to attach importance to this matter . 
After the incident occurred , the appropriate relocation of them . 
Now they are to be delivered safely home . 
Officials from Anhui province and the China Building Materials Group came to the airport to meet the plane , and to convey greetings and appreciation to the eleven employees . 
They expressed deep grief for our comrades killed in the abrupt incident in Pakistan . 
And they expressed an enthusiastic welcome to the other eleven comrades who were able to return to their motherland safely today . 
Concerned parties explained that claims processing for the three victims and consolation of their families were in process . 
Though the bodies of the three murdered Chinese engineers have returned to their mother country , the investigation into the attack continues in Pakistan . 
Just one hour ago , at twelve o'clock Beijing time , Pakistani police met with Chinese consular staff in Pakistan and reported the progress of the investigation to the Chinese . 
Now let 's connect with our correspondent in Pakistan , Tao Ye . 
Hello , Tao Ye . 
Hey , hello . 
Yes . 
In the meeting just now , through - - 
( ( ) ) 
In the information meeting just now , what progress in the investigation was reported ? 
Ah , all right . 
Just as you 've said , only an hour ago , the chief of police in Balochistan , the province where the place where the incident occurred is located , by the name of Yakubu , came to China 's consulate general in Karachi to report on the investigation into this affair by Pakistani police in the last two days to China 's ambassador and consul general . 
In his report , he briefly introduced the current clues and objectives of the , uh , Pakistani police in pursuing the primary culprits . 
Uh , they firmly believe that this matter was done by outsiders , but they are certain that they had contacts with some local residents . 
So , they are now focusing on , uh , uh , certain employees who had employment relationships with the company where the Chinese engineers worked . 
They believe these people could have provided , uh , some clues , provided some intelligence for the culprits , intelligence including , for example , what time the Chinese engineers departed and what time they arrived in what places . 
They may have also provided cover for these culprits . 
So these , uh , aspects are the focus of the current police investigation . 
According to this chief of police , he said that after two days of investigations , they had interrogated over fifty people . 
The scope of this investigation is currently shrinking . 
Also , um , when the Chinese information meeting ended , this chief of police and his police officers also , also went into the mourning hall set up in the Karachi consulate general to pay their respects to the , uh , three deceased . 
Uh , additionally , um , another thing that was relatively interesting was that a Balochistan Liberation Army that had always claimed to exist in the past ( ( ) ) responsibility for this matter , but this news has yet to be verified by Pakistani officials . 
Uh , when answering the questions of this station 's reporter concerning this matter , that chief of police said that this , uh , terrorist organization in fact is a very loose terrorist group with no definite integral organization . 
So , uh , he many many people claim to be members of this organization . 
Uh , therefore , uh , from the Pakistani perspective , they , uh , are still laying the focus of the investigation on many specific individuals . 
As for this organization , they do not view it as a major key , uh , uh , aspect . 
All right . 
All right , Tao Ye . 
( ( ) ) 
Mm , we will continue to keep an eye on the related investigation situation . 
Thank you , Tao Ye , for your onsite report . 
Danish prime minister Rasmussen held a press conference at the Prime Minister 's Office on Tuesday . 
He said , " The incident of the cartoons of Islam founder Mohammed has developed to the current state where extremists are exploiting it . " 
He ( ( claimed ) ) that Denmark respects all beliefs , and he appealed that everyone has the same rights , uh , while also calling on Muslims to exercise restraint and not resort to violence . 
Danish prime minister Rasmussen and the foreign minister held a press conference in the Prime Minister 's Office at 4:30 p.m. on the 7th . 
Rasmussen said . 
The incidents of violence that have occurred at the embassies of these European countries are not merely a matter between Muslim countries and Denmark . 
It is extremely important to the Danish government and the Danish people to obtain the broad support of the international community to pass through this difficulty . 
We have formed an alliance with France . 
Some organizations and institutions in Muslim countries belonging to other European countries and the United States are cooperating closely . 
Several minutes ago , U.S . president Bush telephoned . 
During the telephone conversation , he expressed support for Denmark and consensus with Denmark . 
Rasmussen said , " We also feel that the matter will be resolved through dialogue and tolerance , not violence . " 
We emphasize that freedom and democracy and respect for beliefs are treasured values . 
Today we call on the people in all Muslim countries to cooperate to end the expansion of the violence . 
We must resolve the matter through dialogue , not violence . 
Today we are facing an expanded international situation . 
We have seen the burning of the Danish flag and the destruction of its embassies . 
We see Danish people being seen as intolerant people , being seen as enemies of Islam . 
This is wrong . 
Extremists and radicals are exploiting cultural conflict to expand the situation . 
Rasmussen emphasized , " Denmark and we Danes are not the enemies of Islam or other religions . " 
For many generations has Denmark transcended politics in pursuit of human rights , democracy and freedom . 
We continue to struggle for this . 
This is part of Denmark 's history , and is an essential component of Danish society . 
Denmark is one of the most tolerant and open countries in the world . 
We respect all beliefs . 
We resist violence . 
We believe that everyone has equal rights . 
New Tang Dynasty reporters Li Luo and Dan Ni , reporting from Copenhagen , Denmark . 
Iranian extremists dissatisfied with the publication of cartoons of Mohammed once again charged the Danish embassy in Tehran on Tuesday , lobbing Molotov cocktails at it . 
At the same time , in revenge , a state newspaper in Iran sponsored a contest of cartoons depicting the Nazi slaughter of Jews . 
The United States condemned this move as an arrogant means of intensifying Iranian president Ahmadinejad 's persistent anti - Israeli sentiment . 
Approximately 20 to 30 protesters climbed over the wall into the courtyard of Denmark 's embassy in Iran . 
And more than 300 people outside the embassy threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at the building . 
The previous day , student members of an Iranian hardline paramilitary organization led hundreds of protesters in an attack on the embassies of Denmark and Austria in Tehran . 
The cartoons that triggered the dispute were first published last September by Denmark 's Jyllands - Posten . 
Other European countries and three Arabic newspapers also carried them subsequently . 
In retaliation , Hamshahri , Iran 's most widely distributed newspaper , recently announced that it was sponsoring a contest of cartoons depicting the Nazi slaughter of the Jews . 
This move was sharply denounced by the United States and other countries . 
United States Department of State spokesperson McCormack said that this move by Iran 's best - selling Hamshahri was in order to strengthen the virulent anti - Israeli sentiment espoused by president Ahmadinejad . 
McCormack reiterated that the United States supports freedom of speech everywhere throughout the world , including Iran . 
But he believes that Hamshahri 's cartoon contest and the cartoons of Mohammed published in the Danish media are two entirely separate matters . 
McCormack said , " I do not believe anyone would mention freedom of the press in Iran and freedom of the press in western Europe and the United States in the same breath . " 
Ahmadinejad once said that the slaughter of the Jews was a fiction , and called for Israel to be wiped off the map , attracting broad criticism from the United States and other countries . 
McCormack believes that Hamshahri is owned and published by the conservative municipal government of Tehran . 
The current sponsorship of the cartoon contest is by no means coincidental . 
Since attorney Gao Zhisheng initiated a synchronous 24 hour hunger strike in ten cities nationwide to oppose Chinese Communist oppression , and 170 Shanghai appellants have collectively signed a petition expressing their willingness to participate in this hunger strike activity to defend their rights . 
They also said they would continue to announce the signatures and number of participants in the second batch . 
Please watch the following report filed by this station . 
According to reports , as the result of intentional profiteering activities on the part of the government , Shanghai housing prices are now ranked among the highest in the world . 
Many government units have come up with ways to force demolition and relocation of residents in residential housing in highly priced areas without offering reasonable compensation . 
These people , who have suffered the painful loss of their homes under forced demolition and removal , have been left immediately with no income to rely on . 
Children unable to pay tuition dare not attend school . 
For many years , the vast majority of people who have appealed such matters have been rewarded with time in labor reeducation . 
According to statistical data , Shanghai is the region with the largest number of people petitioning for assistance in China . 
Han Zhongming originally owned a shop , but when faced with forced demolition and removal , his private residence was also resold at an exorbitant price . 
Because he petitioned to higher authorities for assistance , authorities placed him under house arrest and even detained him . 
He jumped from a building and cut his wrists in protest , and was only released recently . 
Chen Enjuan 's store also met with government peremptory demolition and removal . 
The government hired thugs to drag her and her other two family members outside , then a tractor shovel was used to eradicate her house , furniture and all . 
Because she appealed for help , she underwent nearly two years of labor reeducation . 
When Chen Enjuan spoke of this solidarity hunger strike activity , in addition to protesting the government 's thug - like conduct . 
Attorney Gao has offered us much assistance with respect to legal matters , he has helped us very selflessly . 
Our defense of our rights now is a demand for democracy , ah , because we are considering the next generation . 
The generation that preceded us already suffered enough ; we are fighting so that the next generation will not be oppressed . Therefore , we must participate in that rights defense activity . We cannot abandon it . 
According to a report by the Center on Housing Rights and Evictions , a human rights organization in Geneva , China has been listed among the countries with the most serious violations of housing rights in the world . 
Reported by New Tang Dynasty reporter Wang Xin and special assignment reporter Gu Qing 'er . 
With respect to the new round of rights defense hunger strike activities initiated by attorney Gao Zhisheng , on February 15 , many democracy activists and ordinary citizens in Hong Kong , Taiwan , Calgary , Canada and the greater Philadelphia region in the United States expressed their support and solidarity through a variety of means . 
The following is a comprehensive report filed by this station 's reporters . 
The 24 - hour hunger strike activity initiated by attorney Gao Zhisheng in ten provinces and cities throughout China beginning February 14 is in protest of the tyrannical rule of the Chinese Communists . 
Legislative Councilor Leung Kwok - hung , who has expressed support for attorney Gao Zhisheng 's hunger strike movement , said that the Chinese Communists ' unrestrained arrest of defenders of rights in recent days is already an extremely dangerous signal that this regime has absolutely no basis in popular will . 
That same day was the time of the one - day weekly hunger strike by Legislative Councilor Albert Ho , who is in the process of setting up a human rights defender watch group . 
He said that on this day this week , he would introduce the work of a human rights defense lawyer from inside China to the outside world . 
He was also certain that such human rights defense movements would continue . 
On February 13 in Calgary , Canada , employees of the Epoch Times and Falungong practitioners held a joint press conference outside the Chinese consulate , expressing support for the domestic and foreign relay hunger strike initiated by attorney Gao Zhisheng , and opposing the acts of violence against American Falungong practitioner Li Yuan by Chinese Communist agents , and called on the government of Canada and all just - minded people inside and outside China to watch with concern and 
This is Warner Village Square , a busy shopping district in Taipei . 
The global relay hunger strike against oppression initiated by the Epoch Times has entered its second day . 
People from all walks of life in Taiwan have rushed to participate . 
Legislator Tien Chiu - chin also arrived on the scene to join the ranks of the hunger strikers . 
Tien Chiu - chin will fast 24 hours today as a show of solidarity . 
" People in the peaceful , more democractic , more free world should all support this event . " 
She said . 
Five non - governmental social groups , including the Taiwan South Society and the Kaohsiung Medical Professional Association , said that all of Taiwan should speak out in condemnation of the Chinese Communists ' tendency to use violence to handle defenders of human rights . 
Yang Wei - che , professor of the Department of Mathematics at National Taiwan University , said , 
" This is extremely important . 
This can absolutely create a force . 
That monster , its maliciousness , that violence would be very difficult to put down . " 
Over 40 people concerned about Chinese democracy and liberty came from Delaware , Philadelphia , South Jersey and New York to participate in the global human rights defense relay hunger strike press conference in front of the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia , condemning the armed Chinese Communist agents who beat up Epoch Times Chief Technology Officer Li Yuan in broad daylight , and expressing solidarity with the act of justice initiated by Gao Zhisheng in China . 
On that day , 14 Chinese participated in the global human rights defense relay hunger strike for 24 hours . 
The preceding was a comprehensive report filed by reporters for this station . 
India 's Sashastra Seema Bal strengthened Nepal border patrols on February 17 . 
Due to concerns that the Maoist insurrections that have taken place in increasing number and intensity over the last several months could penetrate the border , three new battalions have been added to Sashastra Seema Bal , which is responsible for guarding the 200 - kilometer India - Nepal border in Darjeeling County . 
Nepal faces the Himalaya mountains to the north . 
On its other three sides , it borders on India , with which it shares a border totaling 1,477 kilometers in length . 
Maoist rebels frequently sneak into Indian border villages and obtain weapons from local gangs and drug dealers . 
Deputy inspector general Shanaya of the Lanidanjia region indicated that they would be increasing from the existing 26 battalions to 36 battalions to facilitate patrols of the 100 - kilometer border between Darjeeling County and West Sikkim . 
Shanaya indicated that according to reports , India 's Kamtapur Liberation Organization and Maoist rebels in Jhapa and Ilam counties in eastern Nepal already have close ties . 
Border forces will establish 18 border observation stations and further strengthen border security . 
Trained police dogs will accompany border forces on patrols to detect explosives and drugs . 
Border officials have begun thorough inspections of all vehicles and people passing through sensitive border inspection stations . 
India is concerned that these people could ally with India 's radical leftists . 
Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world . 
The Maoist insurrection has destroyed the entire country 's economy , and forced tens of thousands of residents to flee their homes . 
Japan 's Cabinet Office published gross domestic product data for the fourth quarter of 2005 on Friday . 
After price adjustments , in the quarter from October through December , experienced real growth of 1.4 percent over the previous quarter ; the growth rate exceeded the anticipated rate of 17.2 percent . 
The primary reasons were strong domestic demand and signs of continuing economic recovery exhibited by export growth to major countries such as China and the United States . 
This is Japan 's fourth consecutive quarter exhibiting economic growth , and is the greatest rate since the first through third quarters of 2005 , primarily aided by personal spending , capital expenditures and stable exports . 
Additionally , in April , Japan 's central bank will also end its extremely lax monetary policy of the last five years . This has encouraged financial market expectations for the economy . 
Private sector consumption from October through December rose 0.8 % percent under the effects of slight improvements in the unemployment rate and wages . 
The Nikkei index rose after the announcement of the gross domestic product data , but by the end of the morning session , it had fallen 0.74 points . 
After appreciating briefly , the yen fell , with trading prices hovering at around 118.15 yen to one U.S . dollar . 
A memorial service for Australian media giant Kerry Packer was held at the Sydney opera house on Friday . Thousands participated , including government officials and celebrities from all fields . 
Although Kerry Parker - - Australia 's richest man and media leader - - is no longer with us , the state memorial service held for him on February 17 attracted a gathering of government officials and celebrities from all fields . 
Including Hollywood movie star Tom Cruise and his fiancee Katie Holmes , king of the silver screen Russell Crowe , and golf legend Norman . 
Australian Prime Minister Howard also spoke at the memorial service . 
Kerry Packer , the 68 - year old billionaire , died in his sleep on December 26, 2005 . 
He once dominated the Australian media , and changed the face of international cricket . 
A Panamanian cargo vessel and a Chinese fishing vessel have sunk in waters off Fujian province . A total of 57 persons are missing . 
According to an officer with China 's Fujian Province Marine Rescue Center , a Panamanian cold storage vessel suddenly struck rocks and sank on the evening of February 16 , about 5 kilometers from Dongjiadao in Pingtan County . 
Rescue personnel saved four crewmembers , but 33 people remain missing . 
Additionally , according to Chinese media reports , a little earlier on February 17 , another Chinese fishing vessel is believed to have struck rocks and sunk in the same area . 
Twenty-four of the 27 crewmembers on the ship are missing . 
Immediately following the International Atomic Energy Agency 's decision to hand the Iran nuclear issue over to the United Nations Security Council , Iran reiterated that there is no room for negotiations with the United States , one of the proponents . 
Uh , an Iranian government spokesperson said on Monday that the policy toward the United States implemented to date has been not to discuss or negotiate its relationship with the opposing party . 
He said that it was a major mistake for the west to hand the nuclear issue over to the Security Council , demonstrating the west 's obstruction of Iran 's development . 
On Sunday , Iran said that it was suspending cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency , and would resume uranium extraction and enrichment and prohibit surprise inspections of nuclear facilities . 
So with respect to this issue , Iran 's current attitude is relatively unyielding , and the attitude of the United States is even more unyielding . 
Uh , American secretary of defense Rumsfeld has already reasserted multiple times that the use of military force has not been ruled out with respect to this problem . 
Uh , now it is rumored that the U.S . military is really in the process of implementing such a plan . 
They are developing a kind of superhuge bomb called the mother of bombs . 
Uh , once the Defense Department orders it , they will use this superhuge , uh , bomb to bomb Iran . 
So how big a bomb is this mother of bombs ? 
According to reports , just in terms of weight , it is 30,000 pounds , equivalent to a double decker bus , and , uh , it is also extremely large in volume . 
Uh , the development of such a super bomb is primarily in order to bomb certain , uh , underground facilities in Iran . 
Because of its extremely strong penetration force - - it can pass through concrete as well as steel plates - - it is likely to create a large pit equivalent to 60 meters long half a mile , destroying many such , uh , underground structures and facilities . 
So now it appears that the United States has truly begun provisionally polishing its guns or provisionally making bombs . 
Regarding this issue , Rumsfeld says that no means have been ruled out to resolve the Iran nuclear issue , and military means had already been placed on the table . 
Also , the Iran nuclear issue is continually upgrading , so , uh , when interviewed by this station , a concerned Iranian official stationed in Washington said that in fact , Iran continued to uphold the adoption of peaceful negotiations to cooperate with international society , and , uh , they hoped to alleviate the crisis . 
But he also said that Iran would adjust the contents of its nuclear project in cooperation with Russia . 
Regarding the second round of negotiations between Iran and Russia concerning the uranium enrichment project , Iran said that the negotiations would proceed as originally planned , but it emphasized that the changes occurring in the current situation made it necessary to make some adjustments to the content of negotiations . 
Previously , Russia had always expressed support for Iran 's peaceful use of nuclear power , and it had expressed that it would insist on not submitting the Iran nuclear issue to the Security Council . 
However , now we see that they have already approved the submission of the Iran nuclear issue to the U.N . Security Council . 
With this new situation , we therefore may make some changes to the policies arrived at previously with Russia . 
And , prior to the U.N . Security Council 's final decision as to whether or not to adopt economic and political sanctions in March , Iran has advocated continuous negotiations with international agencies , and it is willing to cooperate with the international community , thereby alleviating the current crisis . 
We emphasize , in order to fight for our own economic development and national construction , Iran will not relinquish the right to peaceful use of nuclear energy . 
Iran has not violated relevant international laws . We hope that the United States can also understand this . 
The Iran nuclear issue is completely different from the problems in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
I think the United States is also very clear on this point . 
As for so - called military attacks , we have not seen any clear statement of position from the United States . 
We do not wish to see the crisis escalate further . 
We also emphasize that we want to use peaceful negotiating methods , but we will not submit to pressure . 
Additionally , ( ( Agabi ) ) also said that he hoped China continue to maintain cooperation with China based on the preservation of its original stance . 
Hu Lin , ( ( Phoenix Satellite News ) ) , reporting from Beijing . 
First , let 's look at today 's headlines . 
The northeastern states and Atlantic coast region of the United States were blasted by the first blizzard of the winter this morning . 
Accumulations exceeded 60 centimeters in some areas . 
Many airports were forced to shut down . 
Over 2,000 flights were canceled . 
And this was the first snowfall of this magnitude in New York City 's history . 
Uh , this was the second highest snowfall record in history . 
Let 's have a look at the specifics . 
On Sunday morning , New York residents woke up to find themselves in a world of white . 
Most buildings and streets outside were covered in a thick layer of accumulated snow . 
New York 's Central Park recorded a snowfall of 57.9 centimeters . 
This is the second highest snowfall record in New York City 's history . 
New York 's Mayor Bloomberg said this was a frightening blizzard . 
For the sake of safety , he urged people to stay at home and not go out . 
The storm forced the cancellation of most flights at New York City 's three airports . 
Some of them were only be able to resume on Monday . 
The snow flew in Washington as well , where snowfall exceeded 50 centimeters . 
Lawns and tree trunks were enrobed in white . 
But President Bush still went to church , as is his custom . 
Many city residents left their homes to appreciate the wintry landscape and took the opportunity to play in the snow . 
United States Weather Service radars showed snowfalls occurring universally from eastern Virginia all the way up to Maine . 
In New Jersey , New York 's Long Island , Connecticut and Maryland , residential and commercial electricity was also interrupted after the blizzard . 
It was estimated that over 150,000 customers were without power . 
Meanwhile , in Europe , a broad area was also affected by snowstorms . 
The southern German state of Bavaria mobilized several thousand firefighters and soldiers , who , together with police and volunteers , cleaned accumulated snow from rooftops and roads . 
The Deggendorf area in eastern Bavaria remained in a state of emergency after several days of major snowfall . 
Some villages had already lost contact with the outside world . 
Pressure from accumulated snow caused a roof to cave in last month in Bad Reichenhall , Bavaria , resulting in 15 deaths . 
Phoenix Satellite News Roundup . 
In the blizzard that blasted the northeastern United States , New York was of course one of the cities affected . 
For the local situation , we are about to connect to this station 's New York correspondent , Luo Xiaoying . 
Hello , Xiaoying . 
Hello , Xiaonan . 
Hey . 
Experiencing such a large snowstorm here , what exactly is the situation like ? 
We 've heard that there are even power outages in some areas , is it true ? 
And what places have been affected ? 
It 's really true . 
In fact , the , uh , area covered by this blizzard is quite broad . 
Then I am very happy to report , we have finally seen the snow stop . 
Although this blizzard came on ferociously , there have been no reports of major casualties . 
Several states in the eastern United States coverage area have been affected , such as Maryland , with 21 inches of accumulation , Pennsylvania with 19 inches , and New York and New Jersey with accumulations in excess of 24 inches . 
Snowflakes could be seen from Virginia to Maine , and even in Tennessee . 
Then , well , uh , as you just said , uh , it resulted in power outages in many areas in the Washington area and Baltimore . 
The total number of households without power is probably over 100,000 . 
New York City is better off , as to power outages in , uh , New York City 's Manhattan , the power supply situation is normal . Only in Long Island are there some outages . 
Rhode Island has declared a state of emergency . 
Only emergency vehicles such as snowplows and ambulances are permitted to pass on roads . 
As to traffic and transportation , a little while ago , uh , the three major airports in the New York area were closed . 
But , uh , as twilight approached , we discovered that , like , certain activities to resume airport operations had begun appearing at Newark Airport in New Jersey and LaGuardia Airport in New York . 
So some people estimate that these airports will open later , uh , in several hours . 
Like Delta Airlines , Delta Airlines has announced that all flights in Washington , as well as Philadelphia , Baltimore and Connecticut have been grounded until Monday . 
At present , Reagan Airport in Washington , DC is already open . 
At present , buses have suspended operation in the New York and New Jersey region . 
And scheduled bus and train service has been reduced . 
Now we are at , uh , it is currently Sunday in New York , still the Lantern Festival . 
To us Chinese , the Lantern Festival , originally , some local Chinese communities had Lantern Festival activities , but they were forced to cancel them . 
As to the people of New York , generally speaking , their Sunday activities were also canceled . Uh , not many people are going out , they are all staying at home . 
Yes . 
What 's troubling everyone now is what to do about work on Monday ? 
Uh , snow removal and , uh , accumulated snow could result in some flooding . 
Therefore , the governments of these , uh , affected areas in the United States are studying how to face the floods of people and cars going to work on Monday . 
Xiaonan . 
All right . 
Thank you , Xiaoying , for giving us the latest report from the United States . 
Since there 's nothing to be done about it , one might as well rest easy and appreciate this , uh , very beautiful snowscape . 
Let 's have a look at several news items concerning Japan . 
Er , Koizumi has always wanted to upgrade Japan 's Defense Agency to a ministry , in order to increase Japan 's military strength . 
But great controversy has been stirred up during this process , which has met with one snag after another . 
Recently , scandals have arisen when Japan 's Defense Facilities Administration Agency , which is subordinate to the Defense Agency , placed requests for bids , uh , requests for construction bids , resulting in arrests by authorities of certain current and former officials . 
Therefore , many people have recommended that Koizumi exercise caution in the process of upgrading the agency to a ministry . 
Well , recently , Koizumi said that he was temporarily shelving this plan , that for the time being he would not be submitting it to the Diet for deliberation . 
Uh , he also hopes that the two ruling parites are able to discuss this issue carefully in order to , er , continue exchanging views . 
In other news , if you go to Japan , there is now a new requirement . 
Japan plans to require the majority of tourists and travelers visiting Japan to be fingerprinted and photographed . 
It is doing so in order to prevent certain unsafe elements from entering Japan . It is also intended to prevent , uh , illegal immigration . 
Er , so now , it should be a little more difficult to go to Japan . 
Well , of course , Japan also had a bit of happy news recently . 
Princess Kiko of Japan is expecting . 
This matter has made many Japanese naturally hope that she will bear a son to succeed to the throne . 
However , she has also made waves in the imperial household , which has always been relatively calm . 
Uh , in fact , Kiko of course is now a later - age expectant mother , and everyone always thought she was satisfied with her family of four . 
With her becoming pregnant again at this age , many people could not help but guess that , uh , a struggle for the throne could be playing out between the brothers of the royal family . 
Of course , many people are delighted to talk about this conspiracy theory . 
To explain this matter may require going back several years . 
Uh , it was like this : at the time , in ' 02 , because Crown Prince Naruhito , uh , his wife , became depressed , the royal family did not hold out much hope for them at the time , so they turned to exerting pressure on Prince Akishino . 
At that time , there was not much response from Akishino . 
But by 2004 , the contradiction intensified somewhat , because Naruhito , eager to protect his wife , blamed the royal family in public . 
Well , according to reports , the royal family was infuriated , and demanded that Prince Akishino , who is of the same generation , step forward to make a rebuttal , saying that his elder brother had been disrespectful to the royal family , and was doting on his wife . 
From then on , there has been discord between the brothers . 
So now , if , uh , Prince Akishino bears a son , then their , uh , main axis will become a pillar of the , uh , royal family . 
And that will assuredly cause a decline of the eastern palace , that is , the crown prince . 
Uh , so a good many people believe that if this happens , it will have a great impact on the royal family and Japanese society . 
United Nations Secretary General Annan went to the White House Monday to meet with American president Bush . 
Regarding Iran 's announced postponement of nuclear negotiations with Russia , Annan urged Iran to cease nuclear activities as quickly as possible , and to resolve problems through negotiations rather than confrontation . 
Another news item indicates that the U.S . Department of Defense has already begun plans for intensive bombing of Iran , to serve as the ultimate backup plan if diplomatic efforts fail . 
Originally , outsiders thought that Bush and Annan would discuss the possibility of UN Security Council sanctions against Iran , but the two did not announce discussions in this regard after their meeting . 
Bush and Annan both emphasized that they hoped the Iranian nuclear issue would be resolved through negotiations . 
Annan expressed concerns over Iran 's commencement of uranium enrichment activities and its decision to postpone nuclear negotiations with Russia . 
On the same day , the U.S . media reported that military strategists at the Pentagon had already begun intensive planning of military actions to be adopted with respect to Iran ; in the event that diplomatic efforts fail , the U.S . will use military means to halt Iran 's development of nuclear weapons . 
According to reports , the commander of the U.S . Central Command is in the process of determining attack targets . 
Attack methods could include submarine - launched ballistic missles and air strikes by B-2 bombers . 
On Monday , Annan called on all parties not to adopt actions that would escalate the crisis . 
According to analysis by military experts , Iran could have the ability to produce nuclear weapons within two years . 
And there are still more than two years remaining in Bush 's second term . 
He will strive to resolve the Iran nuclear issue during his term , whether by peaceful or military means . 
Mo Naiqian , Phoenix Satellite News , reporting from Washington . 
On the 13th , Iranian president Ahmadinejad said superpowers that threaten other countries with their own weapons were about to disappear . 
While commemorating the 27th anniversary of the Islamic revolution , Ahmadinejad met with diplomatic envoys of various countries . 
He said that the arms contests and competitions in the scramble for hegemony among various countries in the world would not yield results . 
The appetites of superpowers can never be satisfied . They even threaten other countries with their weapons . 
But he said these superpowers who rely on weapons to threaten other countries would disappear . 
The day when mankind enjoys permanent peace and stability is about to arrive . 
Thus it can be seen that this is now not merely , um , a war of words , but really and truly , um , this kind of saber rattling between Iran and the western world and America is now getting worse and worse . 
So , because the , uh , attitudes between Iraq and the United States are mutually unyielding , recently , the situation has changed somewhat ; the day before yesterday , Iran formally announced that it was resuming its plans to extract and enrich uranium . 
In fact , some western diplomats surmised that they may very well have actually resumed certain processes in uranium extraction and enrichment prior to this . 
Additionally , Iran announced that it was postponing negotiations with Russia indefinitely ; the negotiations concerned Russia extracting and enriching uranium instead of Iran . 
So of course the indefinite postponement of this negotiation plan was also determined with respect to the current , new situation . 
Uh , recently , because the United States , uh , has continued its threats to attack Iran , a U.K . think tank , the Oxford Institute , has issued a report . 
If the United States actually adopts military force , it will result in the death of half of the people , and of course it will trigger , uh , the possible continuation of this year 's , uh , wave of violence in the Middle East . 
Also , some , uh , terrorist attacks will also worsen . 
Of course , oil prices will also rise sharply . This is also among the , uh , this series of domino effects . 
Moreover , the report also says that if the United States is unable to make Iran submit , it will certainly accelerate Iran 's determination to produce nuclear weapons itself . 
So , we have just mentioned the issue of negotiations between Russia and Iran . 
An Iranian government spokesperson indeed indicated on Monday that due to the emergence of the new situation , the negotiations with Russian officials concerning the extraction and enrichment of uranium inside Russia originally set for the 16th would be postponed . 
A Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said that they had not received formal notification from Iran . 
So it is currently still too early to say whether the meeting will go on . 
Additionally , on Monday , uh , the head of Russia 's Federal International Atomic Energy Agency , Guqinuofu , said that the Russians had already prepared the conditions and principles for negotiations with Iran concerning the nuclear issue . 
At the same time , the New York Times of the United States recently published an editorial . 
And the title of this editorial was extremely striking : Japan 's offensive foreign minister . 
So , this editorial , uh , specifically mentions that Taro Aso , the Japanese foreign minister , has made a series of astonishing statements recently . 
These statements are all extremely dishonest , extremely unwise , and these statements have been met with the universal indignation of Asian countries . 
Well , uh , the editorial also specifically mentions that Japan , uh , should acknowledge its own mistakes and assimilate lessons , unlike what it is doing now - - post - war educational materials avoiding mention of the things they did during the war . 
At the same time , this editorial also says that many of Taro Aso 's current statements , such as demanding that the , uh , prime minister visit the Yasukuni Shrine , such as , uh , colonial rule over Taiwan raised , ah , uh , Japan 's colonial rule raised the education level of Taiwan , etc. - - it astonishes people when he makes such statements , and , very clearly , he has no knowledge of history , and his diplomacy skills are terrible . 
Well , the New York Times had the third largest distribution in the United States last year , so it should be very influential in the United States . 
Therefore , this editorial should also be very influential . 
At the same time , a seminar was held recently by certain former high officials of the U.S . government and certain experts specializing in the study of Asian affairs - - a seminar on Sino - Japanese relations . 
Well , some experts raised the following viewpoint at the seminar . 
They said that Sino - Japanese relations are currently in a period of extreme tension , and that there is a potential risk of military conflict . 
Moreover , they even said that the possibility that a military conflict could erupt between China and Japan was higher than the possibility that a military conflict could erupt across the Taiwan Strait . 
Er , and once a military conflict erupts , the United States is certain to be dragged in , because the U.S . would certainly become involved . 
Well , a spokesperson for Japan 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs who also participated in the seminar said that Sino - Japanese relations are indeed in an extremely tense phase at present . 
Um , any mistakes could result in severe consequences . 
Additionally , the defense and security committee of Georgia 's parliament held an extended session and decided to expel , uh , the Russian peacekeeping forces in the South Ossetia region . 
A general meeting of the Russian parliament will convene today for deliberations on this proposal . 
Er , experts believe that if the parliament approves the expulsion of Russian peacekeeping forces , it could result in a complete rupture in relations between Georgia and Russia . 
On the 14th , a spokesperson for the Russian peacekeeping forces said that two of the Russian peacekeeping force 's military vehicles transporting food were intercepted by Georgian police , and that the drivers had been run off . 
Er , the spokesperson then demanded that Georgian authorites immediately cease such provocative activity , otherwise Russia would not accept responsibility for the consequences of the incident . 
On Monday evening , two military vehicles belonging to the Russian peacekeeping force logistics system that were transporting grain and non - staple foodstuffs encountered an inspection by Georgian police in the South Ossetia region . 
The Georgian police officers on duty ran the Russian drivers and escort personnel off and took the two vehicles by force and drove off in them . 
The incident raised resentment among the Russian peacekeeping force . 
A spokesperson for the Russian peacekeeping forces claims that on February 1 , Georgian police detained a Russian military vehicle in the same area , giving a traffic accident as the reason , and have yet to return the vehicle . 
On February 8 , they detained three Russian officers for two days and nights under the pretext of visa problems . 
Georgia 's intentional acts of provocation are in the hopes that a sanguinary incident will occur in the region , forcing Russian troops to open fire , in order to achieve the objective of withdrawal of the peacekeeping forces . 
On the same day , the Russian embassy in Georgia took up the matter formally with Georgian authorities , demanding that Georgia cease such frenzied provocation immediately , otherwise Russia would not assume responsibility for the consequences of resulting conflicts . 
Media indicated that on February 13th , Georgian defense minister Irakli Okruashivili announced that leaders of the Russian military base in Akhalkalaki had sold several guided missiles used by the " Arrow " type portable guided missile system to South Ossetia . 
On the same day , the Georgian parliament 's national defense and security committee held an extended session , heard reports from force ministries , and decided to expel Russian peacekeeping forces stationed within Georgia 's borders , requesting deliberation of this issue at the general meeting of parliament on the 14th . 
Experts believe that once the final decision passes , it could lead to a final and total rupture in relations between Georgia and Russia . 
Prior to this , Georgian foreign minister Gela Bezhuashvili harshly criticized the Russian position and rejected Russian president Vladimir Putin 's statement that if the west acknowledged Kosovo , Russia could acknowledge Abkhazia and South Ossetia , believing that Russia was sending a signal of encouragement to all separatist regions . 
Russia 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also claimed previously that it will protect Russian citizens in South Ossetia , implying the threat of direct military force against Georgia . 
Lu Yuguang , Phoenix Satellite News , reporting from Moscow . 
Admiral Gary Roughead , commander in chief of the United States Pacific Fleet , announced Tuesday that the U.S . will be dispatching four aircraft carriers to the Asia - Pacific region this summer to conduct the largest - scale military exercises in ten years . 
Roughead also said that the United States would , er , not , uh , view China , um , as a threat . 
The U.S . military hopes to be able to conduct another round of joint exercises with China 's People 's Liberation Army . 
This statement of position immediately attracted the concern of American defense experts . 
The Heritage Foundation , an American think tank , held a seminar Wednesday concerning the Pentagon 's defense evaluation report . 
The delicate relationship between the defense report and the military exercises became one of the focal points of the discussion . 
Some feel that Roughead 's public invitation to China to participate in the military exercises is a good will gesture toward China on the part of the United States . 
At the same time that it invited China to participate in the military exercises , the U.S . also mentioned its hope that the operations of China 's People 's Liberation Army would become more transparent . Some defense experts therefore believe this demonstrates that the Pentagon is puzzled by China 's intentions to expand its military , and hopes to use joint military exercises to engage in mutual probing and exploration . 
Additionally , because the defense evaluation report issued by the Pentagon earlier this month views China as the greatest future potential threat , two defense experts have also indicated that Asia - Pacific military exercises are the U.S . Defense Department 's first step toward adjusting its strategy based on this . 
Xie Xiaoshuang , Phoenix Satellite News , reporting from Washington . 
Also , much attention is being focused on , uh , the American military exercises this summer , because this is the first time in ten years , ah , that the U.S . has had four , uh , aircraft carriers jointly participate in one military exercise , and , uh , it is the first time since the , uh , Vietnam War , that the U.S . has moved aircraft carriers from the east coast to the , uh , western Pacific region to conduct such military exercises . 
So these military exercises are in fact quite close together - - there will be four of them over several months . 
Er , included among them will be one military exercise involving more than one country . 
So this multinational military exercise will include Japan , uh , Korea and Australia . 
Now a look at today 's headlines . 
On the 15th , Chinese engineers and technical personnel were attacked by gunmen in the southern Pakistan province of Balochistan . 
Three engineers from Hefei in Anhui province were killed , as was their Pakistani driver . 
Local police described this incident as a blatant terrorist attack . 
The Chinese consulate general in Karachi has already taken up the matter with the local government , handled related matters arising from the incident , and demanded that the Pakistani authorities apprehend the assailants . 
This group of Chinese engineers worked at a local concrete factory . 
On the 15th , on a road in the small town of Hub , about fifteen kilometers from Karachi , the largest city in Pakistan , they encountered a gunman sitting on the back of motorcycle who opened fire . 
Two of them died on the spot , while the other was seriously wounded and died later . 
Their Pakistani driver was also killed . 
All three came from Hefei in Anhui province . 
The other three Chinese with them in the vehicle fortunately escaped with their lives , and were uninjured . 
The Chinese consulate general in Karachi said it attached a high degree of importance to this incident . 
After the incident occurred , we immediately dispatched our top level counselor and consular officials to the worksite where the incident occurred to assist in handling related matters arising from the incident . 
We have now relocated all of the remaining eleven engineers and technicians from this worksite to Karachi . 
Additionally , the bodies of the three compatriots who were killed have been transported to a hospital in Karachi for preservation . 
Er , so , it should be said that after the incident occurred , we immediately took the matter up with the government of Pakistan , and strongly condemned this attack targeting Chinese nationals . 
We are currently demanding that the Pakistan authorities , ah , do everything in their power to solve the case , and severely , uh , punish the assailants severely . 
We have demanded that Pakistan adopt realistic security measures to ensure the personal and property safety of Chinese personnel and project teams in Pakistan .

Er , after hearing this news , he expressed a high degree of concern for the safety of Chinese engineers and technicians in Pakistan . 
So Hu Jintao , uh , he immediately directed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese embassy in Pakistan to demand that Pakistan apprehend the assailants and ensure the , uh , safety of Chinese personnel in Pakistan , and , er , to handle the final affairs of the deceased appropriately . 
Additionally , Hu Jintao also expressed deep grief for the Chinese personnel who were killed , and conveyed sincere condolences to the families of the deceased . 
All right , let 's contact Chen Yiming , Islamabad correspondent for the People 's Daily , right away to get the latest news on this issue . 
Hello , Mr. Chen . 
Give us an overview of the latest progress in the investigation of the shootings of the Chinese engineers . 
Er , right , anchor . 
Er , as I understand it from the Chinese consulate general in Karachi , um , er , China 's , uh , consulate general has , uh , already informed the , uh , unit where the deceased worked of this unfortunate incident . 
So , according to , uh , convention , um , the , er , final arrangements for the final affairs of the deceased should be made by their work unit , er , in consultation with , um , the families . 
Additionally , Pakistan 's , uh , Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a statement yesterday . 
His , er , the statement indicated that , um , the , uh , instigators of this incident , er , intended to sow discord in relations between China and Pakistan . 
Er , the statement indicated , uh , that they would conduct a thorough investigation of this incident , and , er , would , uh , strengthen security guard work with respect to all , uh , Chinese working in , um , this country , and it indicated that Pakistan would do its utmost to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents . 
Er , in addition , according to a report from Pakistan 's privately - run GEO on the evening of the 15th , in an interview with that station that evening , Baber Bashir , the chief executive officer of Pakistan 's Attock Cement Factory , indicated that after the occurrence of this attack , Pakistan , er , would arrange , um , for the remaining eleven Chinese engineers and technicians working on this project to return to their countries , ah , as quickly as possible . 
In the interview , this Bashir also said that concerning , ah , the doubts raised by some Pakistani media about why , er , when the incident occurred , the Chinese engineers were not accompanied by security personnel , er , he said , uh , in fact , the factory where these engineers worked has its own security system , but because the location where the incident occurred was still within the scope of the factory area , there were no security personnel accompanying them when the incident occurr 
So , he expressed great regret at the occurrence of such an unfortunate incident . 
Anchor . 
Yes , all right . 
Er , also , this was not the first time that Chinese engineers were attacked and killed in Pakistan . 
One previous instance of such an incident occurred in October ' 04 . 
Two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by an armed organization in South Waziristan . 
Ultimately , one of them lost his life during the rescue operation . 
And another was in May of the same year , when three engineers died in a bombing attack in Gwadar . 
Let 's take a look back for a moment . 
On May 3 , ' 04 , in the port of Gwadar in the southern part of Pakistan 's Balochistan province , a van carrying twelve Chinese nationals encountered a car bombing attack on its way to a worksite at the harbor . 
The result : three Chinese engineers died , and nine were injured . 
It is believed that this attack was initiated by local separatists and tribal militias . 
On October 9 of the same year , two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by gunmen in the South Waziristan region along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan . 
During an attempt to rescue the hostages by Pakistani forces soon thereafter , one of the engineers was unfortunately shot and killed . 
However , this hostage incident is believed to have been perpetrated by an armed organization related to a jihadist organization , not by the separatist militia . 
Because China has a close economic relationship with Pakistan , and is participating in the construction of Pakistan 's infrastructure , a good many Chinese engineering personnel work there . 
And Pakistan has tribal militia organizations accusing the government of plundering their natural resources . 
This has resulted in multiple instances of Chinese people becoming the victims of attacks and kidnappings . 
Phoenix Satellite News Roundup 
Let 's look at several news stories from Japan . 
Recently there was this bit of relatively shocking news from Japan 's world of politics . 
Which was that Tsuneo Watanabe , the , um , chairman of Japanese media giant Yomiuri Shimbun , ordered , uh , Yomiuri Shimbun to publish some articles opposing Koizumi 's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine , and Yomiuri Shimbun 's , um , position since then has , uh , been in opposition to Koizumi 's visit . 
Uh , so , in a speech several days ago , this Tsuneo Watanabe , uh , he criticized Koizumi severely , saying that he was extremely ignorant and lacked any historical or cultural knowledge . 
At the same time , he also said that a visit by Koizumi to the Yasukuni Shrine would be like paying tribute to Hitler , and he said that by doing so , Koizumi would cause China and Korea to view Japan as an extremely dangerous country , and this would be a constant source of trouble in the future . 
So why would this attitude of Tsuneo Watanabe 's cause such a great commotion ? 
In fact , he is very influential in political circles , and has always been a controlling character behind the scenes . 
And he , uh , was a person who was far to the right in the past . 
It should be said that he has always supported the hawk faction , and he has worked hard to promote amendment of the constitution . 
But , uh , now , he has truly made a major about face . 
He has turned the muzzle of his gun and begun shooting at Koizumi , adopting an attitude of opposition . 
Actually , when people attacked Koizumi for visiting the Yasukuni Shrine in 2004 , this Tsuneo Watanabe still said , uh , he said he supported it , and he wanted Koizumi to resist the pressure . 
But in a recent talk , he said , " I 'm already over eighty years old , I don 't have much time left . " 
So now , he comes out in lofty tones , speaking out with a sort of very anti - war attitude . 
The effect of this , um , change of sides on his part on Japanese society as a whole naturally remains great . 
For example , concerning himself , he said , " I firmly believe I have this kind of assurance and the ability to change political trends . " 
He also said that if Yomiuri Shimbun received government pressure in the areas of free speech and editorial freedom , he would resist it with his life . 
So what kind of situation has taken shape now ? 
Japan 's biggest newspaper , Yomiuri Shimbun , and Japan 's second biggest newspaper , the super Asahi Shimbun , have begun to join hands in opposition to Koizumi 's Yasukuni Shrine visits . 
Originally , these two major papers were at odds with each other , but after the two chairmen met , they at least reached a consensus on this issue . 
Thus now , both of them have adopted major offensives to , uh , criticize Koizumi . They can be said to be a dream team . 
In fact , these two major newspapers should still have , uh , enormous influence on mainstream public opinion in Japan . 
Also , let 's take a look at the current legislative session in Japan . At a recent meeting , two of the more popular candidates to succeed Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi both said the same thing . 
Who are these two ? 
Yes , one is Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe , and the other is Japanese Foreign Minister Tari Aso , who has repeatedly made astonishing statements recently . 
What did the two of them say ? 
They said that Japan 's , uh , World War II war criminals were not criminals . 
What they meant was , uh , it was the international court that called them , um , criminals , and convicted them of crimes . 
But domestically in Japan , based on international law , based on Japan 's domestic laws , they , the war criminals , had not violated Japan 's domestic laws . 
Therefore , they believe that Japan should not view the World War II war criminals as criminals . 
At the same time , this Shinzo Abe also mentioned that Japan should now turn its eyes to the world at large , develop its relationship with the United States , develop its trade relationships with certain southeast Asian countries , and do its utmost to develop a close relationship with India , and not always focus on China . 
New Regulations for Chinese Electronic Banking Services to be Implemented Beginning March 1 . 
Xinhua News February 6 from Beijing ( reporters Han Jie and Xu Bo ) . The reporters have learned from the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) that the " Administrative Methods on Electronic Banking " and " Guidelines on Electronic Banking Security Evaluation " the CBRC has released will be implemented on February 1, 2006 . 
A spokesperson for the CBRC said that according to the stipulations of the administrative methods , the relevant examination and approval methods of foreign capital financial organizations has basically not changed . Even after branches of foreign banks obtain approval to open online bank services , if they need to add new online banking services the main reporting branch bank within the borders of China should carry out notification and evaluation . 
To standardize the utilization of the Internet for banking services by commercial banks , the People 's Bank of China formulated and issued the " Temporary Methods for Online Banking Administration . " 
The spokesperson for the CBRC said that with the continuous development of electronic banking services among commercial banks , the temporary methods can no longer accommodate the needs of electronic banking risk supervision , therefore the CBRC formulated these two new regulations . 
According to their spokesperson , the CBRC 's firm belief in the qualification of security evaluation institutions is different from the administrative approval of qualification characteristics of industry or enterprise admittance . It is not that the evaluation institutions are opening up required conditions for banking security evaluation , it 's just a reference for financial institutions to select evaluation institutions with . 
As long as security evaluation institutions are in accordance with the relevant conditions and demands , even if they have not had their qualifications recognized by the CBRC , financial institutions can still use them to implement electronic banking security evaluation , but they should carry out management according to the relevant regulations . 
The " Administrative Methods on Electronic Banking " has 99 articles in 9 chapters . It is divided into General Provisions , Application and Modifications , Risk Management , Data Exchange and Transfer Management , Outsourcing Management , Cross - border Business Management , Supervision and Regulation Management , Legal Liability and Supplementary Provisions . 
The " Electronic Banking Security Evaluation Guidelines " has 57 articles in 5 chapters . It is divided into General Provisions , Security Evaluation Institutions , Implementation of Security Evaluation , Security Evaluation Management and Supplementary Provisions .

( Affairs that Effect China From Abroad ) Third Chinese Compatriot Murdered in South Africa within Two Days . 
Xinhua News February 6 from Johannesburg ( reporter Chen Ming ) . Lin Yixing , a Fuqing native from China 's Fujian Province living abroad was injured by local armed men while being robbed during the early morning on February 5 at the bar he operated . In the early hours of February 6 he died in South Africa 's Judicial Capital Bloemfontein Hospital after efforts to save him had no effect . 
According to Feng Yangyue , head of the Chinese Association of Free State , the event occurred in a bar in Welkom more that 130 miles northwest of Bloemfontein . 
At the time , bar owner Lin Yixing was cleaning up and preparing to end business for the day . 
At this time there were still three customers in the bar , one of which took out a hand gun and rushed past the counter and carried out a robbery . 
Lin Yixing , a little over 40 , fought with the ruffian . The ruffian fired once at Lin Yixing and then ran away . 
A local person who heard the news and rushed to the bar took Lin Yixing to the hospital for emergency procedures , but because 'diffusive capillary angiorrhea of the entire body ' rattled Lin Yixing 's body , blood loss did not stop . He died around 3:30 in the early morning of February 6 .

( Selected Best of Newspapers and Periodicals ) Shanghai : Persons with Concurrent Jobs and Graduates of Institutions of Higher Education Become Main Force of Hourly Wage Earners . 
Xinhua News February 7 from Beijing . Shanghai Municipal Ministry of Labor and Social Security announced its ' Guide to Minimum Hourly Wages for 2006 ' on February 6 . The number of jobs covered reached 120 , 11 more than last time . Wages for these jobs saw some increases and some decreases . 
According to the estimations of relevant experts at the Shanghai Municipal Ministry of Labor and Social Security , Shanghai already has over one million people who work for hourly wages . 
According to a report in " China Youth Magazine , " graduates from institutions of higher education and people holding concurrent jobs ( holding two or more jobs at once ) are the main constituencies making up the ranks that work for hourly wages . 
Through direct surveying of nearly 8000 hourly paying jobs , it was found that over half of those surveyed hold concurrent jobs . The proportion of this group reaches 51.1 % of the whole . 
The level of culture of concurrent job holders is usually fairly high , they mainly are employed in jobs with relatively strong technical natures , such as translation positions where the proportion of concurrent laborers is as high as 81.7 % , and fitness areas where the proportion reaches 61.6 % . 
A high income is one important reason that many people are engaged in concurrent hourly paying jobs . 
According to our understanding , some positions have monthly incomes that can reach several tens of thousands of RMB , such as some hard to fill positions like simultaneous interpretation . The majority of hourly positions have monthly incomes reaching 2000 RMB or more , such as those concurrent positions in financial affairs , wedding masters of ceremonies , and so on . 
Satisfying personal interests and expanding one 's knowledge is also an important reason that receives the attention of those holding concurrent jobs with hourly wages . 
For example , Mr. Gu , who holds the position of manager of the Human Resources Department of a certain enterprise , will take a few hours of time every week to handle the financial accounts of the representative office of a certain foreign business . 
Mr. Gu believes that the biggest benefit of concurrent jobs is that it allows his knowledge to continually receive updates , and he has opportunities to be involved in another area . Of course , a monthly income of 2000 RMB also has a certain attraction . 
Because some hourly positions have low employment thresholds , the circumstances of the jobs are flexible and free and have progressively received the attention of many graduates currently looking for positions . Among those making hourly wages , 14 % are university or technical school graduates of the past three years . 
" At first I didn 't want to work for hourly wages , but after a few months , I think it 's better than going to work from nine to five . " 
After college student Huang graduated , the job she found wasn 't very ideal . Finally she registered her name with a hotel to play background music on the piano . 
" I am very satisfied with my current job . I make 100 RMB an hour , and the environment is good , what I want to do now is find more hourly wage jobs . " 
According to our understanding , hourly wage work has already become an important path for graduates to accumulate work experience , exercise their working skills , increase their communication techniques , and grow social experiences . 
Graduates doing hourly work are mainly concentrated on positions with relatively strong technical and intellectual natures , such as translation positions and similar positions with relatively high professional natures and highly era - stylistic performance art positions . Their proportion of hourly wages is 22.1 % and 26.8 % respectively . 
Some hourly work positions have lower technical skills , such as food sales promoter and tally clerks . Unemployed persons can begin working these positions with only simple training . 
The data shows that the proportion of people working hourly wage jobs that were originally unemployed reaches 39 % , among which retail jobs have a proportion as high as 68.4 % of workers that were unemployed , and a proportion of 58.7 % among food and beverage jobs . Hourly wage jobs have become an important channel for the unemployed .

China Puts Forth ' Key Science Research Plan ' for Next 15 Years . 
Xinhua News February 9 from Beijing , ( reporter Li Xing ) . To increase the international competitiveness of China , greatly further maintainable development , and realize key development leaps , the " National Mid to Long Term Science and Technology Development Plan Guidelines ( 2006 - 2020 ) " released by the State Council on February 9 deploys four key science research plans . 
These four key science research plans are protein research , particle control research , nano research , and growth and procreation research . 
The guidelines point out that protein science is the strategic highpoint in life sciences being intensely fought over in developed nations at present . 
In the next 15 years , China must place emphasis on researching the key biology fields of transcriptomics , protein science , metabonomics , structural biology , and the functions and mutual effects of protein biology , system biology and protein biology with correlated calculations , methodology for protein research and basic research for relevant applications . 
The guidelines also believe that particle control research has an obvious forward looking nature and will likely produce a hard to calculate influence on human social and economic development 20 to 30 years from now . 
China must put emphasis on researching particle communications mediums and control concepts and methods , particle computation , new particle effects limited to small particle systems , new concepts and new technical foundations for particle control attributes and measurement . 
Besides this , the guidelines point out , nano science and technology has already become the strategic choice for many nations in improving their core competitiveness and is also an area in which China hopes to realize great leaps in development . 
In the next 15 years , China 's key research into this area will include the controlling methods of nano materials , self assembly and functionality , nanoelectronics , nano biology and nano medicine , nano scale attributes and measurement science , as well as effects of nano material and nano technology in energy resources , the environment , information technology , medicines , and other areas . 
China 's population growth is large and its inadequacies are many , organ transplants are seriously short and the peak of an aging society will soon arrive - therefore China urgently needs breakthroughs and technical innovations in growth and procreation science theory . 
According to the guidelines , from 2006 to 2020 China will place emphasis on researching cell growth , division and control , the arising , maturing and impregnation of reproductive cells , the decline of human reproductive functions and the mechanisms of degenerative changes , safety and morals of aided reproduction and stem cell technology .

Chinese Expert : America Beating Drum of ' Chinese Military Threat ' is Irrational Criticism 
Xinhua New February 9 from Beijing ( reporters Li Xuanliang , Xiong Zhengyan , and Lin Liping ) The Pentagon 's " Quadrennial Defense Review Report " formally handed over to Congress in recent days has for the first time referred to China as 'the newly rising major nation most likely to present a military challenge to America ' . 
Experts believe this is an irrational criticism of China 's normal defense construction , a dramatization of the ' Chinese military threat theory ' , and is an interference in China 's internal affairs . 
The " Quadrennial Defense Review Report " is the Pentagon 's new national defense policy paper . 
This 92 page long report uses three sections to discuss the problem of Chinese military force and what paths America should take to meet this problem . The report directly brings up ' China ' or ' Chinese ' a total of 15 times , saying 'as a major and newly prosperous large nation , China has the most potential to carry out military competition with America . If America does not have counter - measures , China will likely develop destructive military technologies , thus breaking America 's ad 
Researcher Yao Yunzhu of the World Military Research Department of the China Military Science Institute says that , although high level American officials have expressed similar views many times before , this is the first time America put forward that ' China is the newly rising major country most likely to present a military challenge to America ' in its 'defense strategy reports ' . 
' This report for the first time clearly takes Russia , India , and China as newly rising strategic opponents , among which it especially gives even more consideration to the so called Chinese military threat theory . ' 
Said Major General Peng Guangqian , researcher of the China Military Science Institute . 
Worth noting is that on the same day that the " Quadrennial Defense Review Report " was formally handed in , American President Bush also handed to Congress the government budget for fiscal year 2007 , in which the defense budget reached 439.3 billion USD . 
' If you add on to this the budget for the military movements in Iraq and Afghanistan , America 's 2007 fiscal year defense budget will breakthrough 500 billion USD , setting a new historic high ' Peng Guangqian said . ' This is nearly equal to the total military expenditures of all other countries in the world put together . ' 
Peng Guangqian believes that the method of America concocting 'threat theories from other countries ' reflects the Pentagon 's usual style of 'creating enemies . ' Its real aim is in striving for even more defense expenditures , and dredging up even more profits for America 's huge military industrial complex . 
Experts say , compared with America 's huge military expenditures , China 's defense expenditures are relatively limited . 
Military expert Deng Hongzhou , who has taken part in the writing of China 's Defense White Paper several times , said that since the 1990 's , along with economic development , China 's defense expenditures have increased , but have shown a declining trend in the total proportion of national revenue expenditures of the same period . 
Official data shows that in 2004 as compared to 1979 , China 's defense expenditures fell by ten percentage points in terms of the proportion of national revenue expenditures of the same period . 
In 2005 , China 's defense expenditures were 244.656 billion RMB , equal to only approximately 1/14 of America 's . Average per capita military expenditures are only equal to about 1/60 of America 's . Per capita spending on military personnel is only equal to approximately 1/30 of America 's . 
' America 's land area is about equal to China 's land area , but military expenditures of the two countries have a huge difference . It is self evident which country has military strength that exceeds its normal defense needs . ' 
Peng Guangqian said . 
Teng Jianqun , Director of the Research Department of China 's Military Control and Disarmament Association , expressed that America should objectively appraise the situation of China 's military construction . China 's peaceful development does not mean that China and America will become military opponents in the future . 
The " China 's Defense in 2004 " White Paper said China staunchly follows the path of peaceful development , and carries out a defensive national defense policy . 
China has never become a threat to any country in the past or present , and will not become a threat in the future . 
Up until now , China has not established military bases in any country , and has not sent one soldier to any other country , while America has over 100 military bases abroad , and in the Asian Pacific region alone has in excess of 100,000 military forces deployed . 
Professor Zhu Feng of Beijing University 's International Relations Institute said that China and America should go through already established channels to increase communication and exchanges , increase understanding and mutual trust , comprehensively further Chinese and American constructive cooperative relations in the new century and jointly promote maintaining world peace and development .

( International ) White House Announces Bush Will Visit Pakistan and India in March as Planned 
Xinhua New February 9 , from Washington ( reporter Zhao Yi and Li Xuejun ) . Press secretary for America 's White House Scott McClellan said at a news conference on February 9 that although the cartoon incident involving blasphemy of Islamic profit Muhammad has triggered a strong protest movement in the Islamic world , President Bush will still visit Pakistan and India in March according to plans . 
McClellan said that Bush looks forward to visiting Pakistan and India . 
He also said that he is currently making arrangements for this visit . 
McClellan expressed the above statements under a situation that has seen some areas in Pakistan hold various protest demonstrations against the blasphemy of Islamic profit Muhammad . 
This January , when Bush met with Pakistani Prime Minister Aziz in the White House , both sides expressed their desire to strengthen friendly cooperation and jointly strike at terrorism , which damages the security of both nations .

( International Observation ) Hamas Looks for Breakthrough in Forming Cabinet 
Xinhua News February 9 from Ramallah ( Internationl Observation ) . Hamas Looks for Breakthrough in Forming Cabinet 
Xinhua News reporter Hao Huangmin 
After the Palestine Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) obtained victory in legislative elections , how it will paint a blueprint for a new government has become a focal point the whole world is concerned with at the moment . 
What kinds of new policies Hamas will put forth will directly influence the direction taken by all concerned parties in corresponding policy for the peace process . 
At the same time , the attitude of resistance of America and Israel adds even more variables to the prospects of the Hamas government . 
At present , various Palestinian factions are currently tightening their cooperation , and are actively searching for breakthroughs on the future development of the situation on sensitive points and difficulties that forming a cabinet involves . 
( Sub Heading ) Who Will the Position of Premier Fall to ? 
After Hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet , there have been people in the outside world who worry a ' Hamas Premier ' will likely see differently than the current high leader Abbas . 
Also , Hamas leader Mashal , who is currently visiting Egypt , emphasized that the new Palestinian government established by Hamas leaders will not continue to recognize Israel . This intransigent standpoint also intensifies the worry of the international community . 
America and Israel explicitly state they will not accept a Hamas government that controls real power , and have used this threat to cut off economic support and transmission of taxation to Palestine . 
However , this has not obstructed Hamas in making flexible policy adjustments - choosing independents is a policy to split the difference . 
According to reports , to acquire international approval across the largest range possible , earlier domestic and foreign Hamas leaders meeting together in Egypt decided to choose independent Ismail Haniyeh , Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Islamic University in Gaza , to be appointed the new premier . 
This move has still not received the responses of concerned parties . 
Palestine Analyst Hussein said that no matter who the position of premier falls to , what is most crucial is the choice for premier must dilute the 'hard ' aspects of Hamas as much as possible . Only by doing this can the successful forming of a cabinet be secured . 
( Sub Heading ) How to Allocate Power 
Looking at the internal makeup of the party , the biggest challenge that Hamas faces in forming a cabinet is it lacks ample experience being in power . 
The Palestine " Daily " published an analysis saying that while Hamas gathered popularity through social welfare projects , in the area of being in power it lacks experience . Hamas cooperating with the Palestinian National Liberation Movement ( Fatah ) , which has experience being in power , would be the best strategy . 
Hamas brought up establishing a 'government partner ' relationship with Fatah after the elections to jointly establish a united ethnic government , however Fatah has not given a positive response to this as of the present . 
Opinions among those in the Fatah party as to whether or not to enter the cabinet are not the same . One faction advocates participating in the new government , and thus having something to say ; another faction refuses the invitation of Hamas , and would rather be an 'active opposition faction ' in the legislature . 
Persons with sensitive information pointed out that under the advice of Abbas , Fatah is progressively leaning towards entering into the new government . 
Although this might be the case , Hamas and Fatah would still haggle over the allocation of cabinet positions . 
Besides this , another path would be to establish a cabinet that is free of party affiliations and outside the framework of the legislature . 
According to reports , Hamas has also designed a technocracy government , but the concrete list of names is still unknown . 
In light of the attitude of Israel and America , a technocracy government might still be accepted as a method to form a cabinet that would lessen outside pressure . 
According to regulations of the Palestine " Basic Law , " after the new legislature convenes on the February 16 , the nominations for premier and forming of a cabinet will be completed in three to five weeks . 
( Sub Heading ) At a Loss About Armed Forces 
The weapons in the hands of Hamas are another thorny problem that the forming of a new government faces . 
America 's and Israel 's attitude is extremely stiff . They staunchly demand Hamas give up violence , and reject Hamas taking part in government while carrying guns . 
Hamas leader Mashal emphasized on February 9 that armed resistance is the 'strategic choice ' of his organization . 
The arms problem in actuality includes two levels of problems : The legality of weapons , and the jurisdiction and management of armed forces . 
Hamas has obtained international acknowledgement for being the largest party in the legislature elected in a democratic and free manner , allowing its subordinate armed faction the ' Qawasameh tribe ' to use legal avenues to unify itself into the government 's security organizations . 
Hamas once brought up unifying all armed factions into a Palestine ethnic power organization 'people 's army . ' However it did not get a broad response , and also took criticism from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement . 
At present , Palestine has over 60,000 security organization personnel , the vast majority of which come from the Fatah camp . 
Also , Fatah has some subordinate armed factions with loose organizational relations , such as the 'al - Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigades ' and the ' Fatah Hawks ' and others . 
Hamas , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must come to an understanding with Abbas on how to manage these armed forces that each have their own power structures , and allocate the power of management of security in a reasonable way . 
According to the reports of local media , Abbas is interested in managing the security and information regiments , while the police and people 's guard and other organizations will be subordinate to the management of the Department of the Interior of the new government . 
However , all sides are still carrying out discussions on this sensitive issue , and as of now there is nothing further . 
China Releases Polar Region Survey Reports for the First Time 
Xinhua News February 10 from Beijing ( reporter Li Jianmin ) . China 's State Oceanic Administration released the " 2005 China Polar Region Survey Report " in recent days . This is the first time China has released this kind of report in the over 20 years since China opened polar region scientific survey activities . 
The " Report " fully reflects China 's polar region scientific survey activities for 2005 , the safeguarding of logistics for polar region surveys , the main developments and results in polar region scientific research and other situations . 
According to that recorded in the " Report , " on January 9, 2005 , at 10:15 p.m. ( Beijing time ) , China 's Polar Region Survey 's Inland Ice Sheet Survey Team reached an ice dome with the highest altitude on the Antarctica shelf - Region A ; on January 18 at 3:15 a.m. ( Beijing time ) they confirmed that the highest point on Ice Dome A was 4093 meters . 
' On the stage of the daily intensifying competition of international polar region surveys , China relied on its will of iron and unshakable spirit to bravely open up a brand new region , and opened up an assault on the highest point on the Antarctic Ice Sheet for the first time , obtaining success in the first attempt and realizing another dream of mankind in Antarctica . ' 
Sun Zhihui , head of the State Oceanic Administration said . 
The " Report " shows that on March 24, 2005 , China 's 21st Antarctic Survey Team successfully completed their task and returned to Shanghai . Their tour of research lasted 151 days , a voyage of 26,500 knots . 
On November 18 of the same year , China 's 22nd Antarctic Survey Team left Shanghai , going to Zhongshan Station in Antarctica to carry out scientific investigation activities , and will leave Zhongshan Station at the end of February 2006 to return to Shanghai via Australia . 
Because this is the first time China has released its polar region survey report , the " 2005 China Polar Region Survey Report " also carried out a review and summary of Chinese polar region surveys beginning in the early 1980 's . 
According to the " Report " , in 1983 China formally entered the " Antarctica Treaty " , became a member country of the Antarctica Treaty System , and also became a negotiating country in the Antarctica Treaty , a member of the Antarctica Science Research Committee , a member of the Antarctica Council , and other influential international organizations dealing with Antarctica . 
In 1997 , China became a member of the Arctic Science Committee , winning the right to decide policy and speak in international polar region affairs . 
The " Report " points out that in over 20 years , China 's polar region surveys have " continuously developed from nothing and for the first time have real scope . " The Antarctic and Arctic Science Survey System already has " three stations and one ship , " that is : Changcheng Station established in February 1985 in Antarctica , Zhongshan Station established in February 1989 in Antarctica , Huanghe Station established in July 2004 in the Arctic , and the " Xuelong " class polar survey ship tha 
The " Report " estimates that as of the end of 2005 , China had already organized 22 Antarctic Science Surveys , two Arctic Science Surveys using the " Xuelong " as a platform , and two survey 's from the Huanghe Arctic Station . As of the present , China already has sent over 3000 people to personally go to the Antarctic or the Arctic to carry out on - sight surveys . 
" At present we are currently doing feasibility research work into building the third Antarctic survey station which would also be the first inland survey station for China . " 
Sun Zhihui said . 
" After over 20 years of hard work , China 's polar region survey enterprise already has a definite position among the world 's polar region surveys . However , compared with the other main polar region surveying countries , there still exists a relatively large discrepancy . We must push on ahead . " 
He said . 
Sun Zhihui revealed , China will publish polar region survey reports every year from now on .

Accident Occurs on Beijing to Harbin Highway Waste Oil Leakage Closes Off Section of Road 
Xinhua News February 11 from Harbin ( reporter Liang Shubin ) . Around 11 p.m. on February 10 , a traffic accident occurred at a location 58 kilometers along the Beijing to Harbin highway . A tanker truck developed a leak leading to the closing of a section of the road . 
According to statements of traffic brigade policemen of the department of public safety of both cities , around 11:00 p.m. on February 10 a three car accident occurred on a location 58 kilometers along the Beijing to Harbin Highway . One sedan , one cargo truck , and one tanker truck collided together . A crack in the tanker truck began to leak and the waste oil the truck contained flowed onto the road . 
According to our understanding , the tanker truck was carrying waste oil from the production of coke . 
Because the waste oil is thick and sticky and because of the danger of fire from sparks of passing vehicles , relevant departments have already closed off the scene of the accident . 
A part of the Harbin section of the road in both directions is closed and many vehicles have circumvented this section . 
At present , relevant departments are cleaning up the scene and the cause of the accident is under investigation .

High Definition Digital TV Slowly Becoming Mainstream in America 
Xinhua News February 12 from New York ( reporter Fan Xiaolin ) . With the continuous decline of prices and the continuous expansion to the market of High Definition Digital TV (HDTV) sets , the American TV broadcasting organizations are hurriedly putting out relevant HDTV programs . 
The recent ' Super Bowl ' competition of American style football has already become the warm up match for American broadcasters to welcome and receive the era of high definition . 
According to reports in " The Financial Times " in previous days , America 's Congress recently passed a law stipulating that American broadcasters must totally stop broadcasting analog signals before February 17, 2009 and only broadcast digital signals . 
This means that the digitalization of American TV program broadcasts already has a clear timetable . 
The spread of HDTV must rely on the buying of TVs by consumers in one aspect , and in another aspect rely on the supply of HDTV programs by TV producers . 
Although digital TV has been brought up many times in the past few years , it has never become reality . 
This problem saw a turning point this year . 
According to the forecasts of America 's Consumer Electronics Association , the sales volume of digital TVs this year will for the first time exceed that of traditional TVs , and 85 % of digital TVs are high definition products . 
Japanese Researchers Develop New Model Highly Effective Artificial Kidney 
Xinhua News February 13 from Tokyo ( reporter Qian Zheng ) Researchers of Japan 's Tokai University have developed a kind of biological artificial kidney . It not only has the same catabolic functions as a human kidney , it also has functions to maintain useful substances . It has a small volume , is easy to transplant , and with more research there is hope it will bring good fortune to kidney disease patients . 
According to a report in previous days in the " Nikkei Business Daily " , the newly developed biological artificial kidney is mainly made up of two parts . One part is the 'artificial kidney unit ' that strains out waste material and water from blood , the other part is the 'artificial urine tubes ' that returns water , amino acids and other useful materials back into the blood from crude urine . 
The 'artificial kidney unit ' and the 'artificial urine tubes ' are both made up of hollow fibers . The inner side of the 'artificial urine tubes ' are lined with the epithelia of urine tubes that have the function of dissimilating waste material . 
This type of epithelia can make diseases brought about by multiple blood dialysis - such as the materials causing the formation of 'amyloid degeneration related to dialysis ' dissolve into amino acids and return to the blood , while also allowing the glucose , vitamins , minerals and other things that the body needs returned to the blood . 
Artificial kidneys in the past relied on the difference between permeation pressure to filter metabolized waste , and could not totally get rid of everything . They also did not have the function of returning amino acids and other materials back into the blood . 
Researchers used a goat to carry out transplant experiments with the artificial kidney . Pig epithelia was used for the hollow fibrous inner wall of the artificial kidney used . 
After two weeks , researchers confirmed that the artificial kidney was functioning . 
At present they are developing a biological artificial kidney using cells from human kidneys , and will begin clinical research after they verify its safety . 
China 's Safe Production of Electricity Still Faces Serious Challenges 
Xinhua News February 13 from Beijing ( reporter An Bei ) . An official of the State Electricity Supervision Committee said on February 13 that although safe production of electricity in 2005 maintained an overall stable trend , the safe production of electricity still faces serious challenges . 
Shi Yubo , Chairman of the State Electricity Supervision Committee , said at the 5th ( expanded ) State Electricity Safe Production Committee Conference being held in Beijing that China 's safe electricity production in 2005 maintained an overall stable trend . It satisfactorily completed the task of getting through the summer peaks , realized the safe supplying of energy , actively responded to the attack of natural disasters , and basically assured the safe and stable operations of the e 
However , he also pointed out that with the changes of the supply and demand trends of electricity as well as the successive bringing into service of newly built generator groups , safe electricity production will face new challenges . 
These challenges include the continued existence of regional , seasonal , and time interval power shortage phenomenon because electricity supply and demand trends of some areas are still tight . The supply of electricity coal ( coal used in generating electricity ) still has rather large problems because there is no excellent electricity coal pricing mechanism . At the same time , the problem of falling quality of electricity coal has not received effective controls , seriously influenc 
Shi Yubo said that with the deepening of reforms of the electricity system , many deep rooted contradictions will continuously be revealed . The new problems will become how to maintain the stability of the workforce , and secure a normal production order . 
In terms of tasks for safe electricity production in 2006 , Shi Yubo expressed that we must further solidify the basic tasks of safe electricity production management , speed up the establishment and perfection of electricity safety emergency response management mechanisms , and increase the ability to handle unexpected incidents . In addition , we must strengthen the coordination of the power plant grid and jointly maintain the safety of the electricity system . We must also continue 
According to our understanding , by uniting with the new trends in safe electricity management the electricity supervision committee will carry out modifications and perfections of the already published " Temporary Investigation Regulations on Electricity Production Accidents " this year , while the relevant accompanying documents on large hydro electric dam safety and safety protection of the second order electrical power system will be successively issued this year . 
In 2005 China 's use of electricity reached 2.468 trillion kilowatt hours , a 13.5 % increase over the previous year . 
Facing an electricity supply and demand trend that is still tight and prominent coal power and oil transportation contradictions and other non - advantageous situations , various electricity enterprises have conscientiously taken effective measures and strengthened facility management . Last year no extremely large facility accident occurred in the nation 's electricity production . 
74 electricity grid accidents occurred , a decline of 127 from the previous year . 427 facility accidents occurred , a decline of 132 from the previous year . 
South African Minister Assigned to China Expressed South Africa Does Not Have ' Organized ' Crime Directed at Chinese Citizens . 
Xinhua News February 13 from Beijing ( reporters Wang Jiangang and Hao Yalin ) . Temporary representative of the South African Embassy in China Vusi B. Koloane expressed on February 13 while being interviewed by a Xinhua reporter that South Africa does not have 'organized ' crime directed at Chinese citizens . 
He also expressed that the South African government will do its best to " crush all forms of criminal activities . " 
Koloane expressed that the South African government hopes to " lower to zero " the crime rate , and hopes that the safety of the lives and property of all foreigners working in South Africa will receive the ample assurance of local law and citizens . 
Since the beginning of 2006 , there have already been 4 Chinese citizens that have been murdered in South Africa . The Chinese world has expressed extensive concern over this . 
China 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already put forward discussion of this to South African parties , and warned Chinese citizens traveling in South Africa to further strengthen their safety and defense knowledge . Overseas compatriots should stick together and coordinate with police to jointly crush criminal behavior . 
" We express the most sincere condolences and mourning to the families of those murdered . " 
Koloane said , " We feel apologetic because of this . Please allow the people of China to believe that the South African government is currently seriously investigating every case that involves China . " 
According to the statement of the Chinese Embassy in South Africa , South African police have already successfully broken the case of Chinese Fujian female Chen Jianqing 's murder on February 5 , and one suspect is already arrested . 
At present the police are pursuing another suspect . 
Also according to the South African Embassy in China , a criminal wanted as a suspect in the January shooting of a Hong Kong businessman has already been arrested by South African police , and the belongings of the murdered person have already been retrieved . 
When talking about the influence that Chinese citizens being murdered is likely to produce , Koloane believes that these events " indeed " will produce some negative effects on the trade , tourism , and other areas of exchange between the two nations ; but looking at the long term , the effects " shouldn 't be great . " 
According to the statements from Assistant Director of Tourism Manqoba Nyembezi of the South African Embassy , the Embassy sent out over 2000 visas for travel to South Africa by Chinese in the first 15 days of this year alone . 
Also , according to China 's official statistical data , in 2005 South Africa continued to keep China as South Africa 's largest trading partner . 
The volume of bilateral trade reached 7.27 billion USD , a year on year growth of 23 % . 
However , personnel in the tourism field believe that the Chinese citizen murders that happened in 2004 will have a clear effect on the number of Chinese going to South Africa to travel . 
According to the statistics of the South African Tourism Bureau , the first half of 2005 saw 20,331 Chinese tourists travel to South Africa , a drop of 14.9 % with that of the year before . 
At present there are around 200,000 Chinese that live in South Africa , spread throughout South Africa 's cities , towns , and villages . 
Analysts believe that the disparity between rich and poor in South Africa is great , the level of unemployment high , guns are everywhere , and there is no deterrence from a death penalty ; thus the crime rate is high . 
Because many Chinese do not understand English but keep cash on their persons and at home , they more easily become targets for criminals looking for money .

Beijing University Sets up Funeral Hall to Mourn Academician Wang Xuan 
Xinhua News February 15 from Beijing ( reporter Li Jiangtao ) After several days of hurried decorations , the funeral hall that Beijing University set up to remember school Academician Wang Xuan at Centennial Anniversary Lecture Hall formally opened at 9:00 a.m. on February 15 . 
At a little past eight in the morning , the opening of the funeral hall had still not occurred , yet there were already several tens of people queued outside . 
This reporter saw inside the great memorial hall of Beijing University 's Centennial Anniversary Lecture Hall that hanging on the walls of the great hall was a black banner : " Solemnly mourn Academician Wang Xuan . " 
Below the banner was a huge picture of Wang Xuan ( over 10 square meters big ) . He is wearing glasses , smiling slightly , and his temperament is of learned elegance . 
On both sides of the portrait were several dragon cypress trees and several tens of flower wreaths lined up on each side . 
Among these , the funeral couplet of one of the flower wreaths said : " This foundational skill that glorified China began in the Qin Dynasty and matured in the Tang dynasty / he sent off lead writing implements and welcomed in electronics as a modern day Bi Sheng to draw a blueprint for his invention . " 
There was soft funeral music in the hall and the atmosphere was solemn and heavy . 
Among those mourning Academician Wang Xuan were Beijing University leaders , teachers and students . There were friends , colleagues , students , neighbors , and even people he did not know that had specially come . 
Some had fresh flowers in their hands , some held flower baskets , and every person had a small white flower pinned to his or her chest . They slowly made their way to before the picture of Academician Wang Xuan and bowed to show their respect . 
Many people could not help but to shed warm tears . 
Zhang Wenbin , who once was the bureau head of the State Cultural Bureau , is an old Beijing University alumni . He told this reporter that over ten years ago when he was still working in Henan Province , he once invited Professor Wang Xuan to give a report on science and technology innovation to cadres of the provincial committee . 
" Academician Wang Xuan was a model for both pursuing studies and personal conduct . He made important contributions to the nation and society and the people will never forget him . " 
Professor Jin Ruilin of Beijing University Institute of Law was an old friend and neighbor of Wang Xuan 's of over 40 years . 
A few days ago he just got out of the hospital . Today he insisted on coming here to say goodbye to his old friend . 
When Mr. Jin left a message in the message book , he could not control his grief , and had to wipe away the tears flowing from his eyes several times . 
He told reporters , the daily life of Professor Wang Xuan was extremely thrifty and simple , " When he lived in the Tongfuyuan Community , he already was a professor , and already had very high accomplishments , yet still only lived in a very small bungalow for many years . 
Later he moved to the Chengzeyuan Community , and lived in a 78 square meter place for over 10 years . 
Beijing University gave him a 140 plus square meter apartment in Langqiying Academician Building , but he didn 't want it . He also refused a high - rise apartment that Fangzheng Mansions offered him . " 
Mr. Jin remembered with great emotion that when Wang Xuan visited foreign nations , these nations offered him a very high salary to stay , but he always resolutely refused . 
" At first he insisted on not applying to be an academician , it was only after Mr. Zhou Peiyuan motivated him several times that he went and filled out the form . " 
What leaves Mr. Jin deeply touched also includes Wang Xuan 's attitude toward training young people . " He emphasized several times that 'what successes do I have now , it 's not about me , but instead should be about relying on training young people . ' " 
Mr. Jin said that when he was in his 50s , Wang Xuan began to pay attention to training younger people . He always emphasized that he must pave the road , be happy to be a ladder , and yield to younger people . 
" This is not easy at all for a scientist that had great accomplishments . " 
This reporter learned from the Beijing News Center that from 9:00 a.m. on February 15 to 12:00 p.m. on February 19 , Academician Wang Xuan 's funeral hall will be open to the public every day from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. , allowing people from various fields to come and mourn .

Xinhua News February 15 from Moscow ( reporter Song Shiyi ) . News Official Vyacheslav Sedov of Russia 's Department of Defense gave a talk to media on February 15 saying that the decision of the Georgian Parliament concerning Russia 's peace keeping forces will not influence the peace keeping activities of Russian soldiers in the short term . Russian soldiers will continue to carry out their peace keeping mission in the conflict region of South Ossetia . 
Andrei Kokoshin , head of Russia 's State Duma 's ( lower house of parliament ) committee on relations with the Commonwealth of Independent States , pointed out when giving a talk on the Georgian Parliament 's decision concerning Russia 's peace keeping forces on the same day that this decision of Georgia 's will damage the stability of the area , and produce non - advantageous influences on Russian - Georgian relations . 
He emphasized that this decision of the Georgian Parliament will cause the relations of Georgia and Russian to take another step toward deterioration . 
He believes Georgian criticisms of Russia are absurd . 
That day Georgia 's Parliament passed a decision requiring Russia 's peace keeping forces to stop their peace keeping activities in South Ossetia , but did not confirm a concrete time limit by which Russian peace keeping forces should withdraw . 
Georgia 's Parliament criticizes that Russian peace keeping personnel do not carry out their stipulated duties , and look at the activities that Russia has taken in the conflict region as " aiming to annex this territory of Georgia . " 
The Georgian Parliament requires the government take active moves and consider bringing in an international peace keeping force into the South Ossetia conflict region to replace Russia 's current peace keeping activities in the area . 
The Georgian Parliament also gave the task of amending the relevant agreements confirming Russia 's peace keeping forces may be garrisoned in the conflict region to the government . 
South Ossetia is a self - governed state of Georgia and borders Russia 's Republic of North Ossetia - Alania . 
After the Soviet Union disintegrated , South Ossetia proclaimed independence by itself , and for a long period has been in a state of antagonism with the Georgian Central Government . 
At present , Russia has a 500 person peace keeping garrison in that region . 
This force was garrisoned according to agreements signed by Russia , Georgia , North Ossetia - Alania , and South Ossetia in 1992 .

The administration will totally and thoroughly close down the 5243 coal mines pits reported to society , as well as the over 700 coal mine pits newly reported from various locations . 
These closings must be a regular task ; the administration must continuously close down those coal mines that destroy resources , pollute the environment , and are not equipped with safe conditions . 
- - strengthen basic coal mine safety management . 
The administration will immediately correct or prevent the deterioration of management of a small number of large state owned mines . It will lead management of disorderly small mines to establish standardized safety management systems . 
The administration will especially manage key state owned mines ; never allowing production that exceeds ability , intensity , or manpower . 
This year 's safe production control index demands that deaths from all types of accidents across the nation decline by 3 % over last year , with deaths from coal mining falling 3.5 % . 
Extremely large accidents where 10 or more deaths occur at once should fall by 5 % , and 7 % for coal mining . 
These control indexes have already been received by the people 's government of all provinces . All locations are currently breaking down these indexes piece by piece and implementing them in the infrastructure and enterprises . 
Statistics show that in 2005 deaths from mining accidents across the nation were 5,986 , a fall of 0.7 % over the previous year . 
However , deaths from especially large accidents with 10 or more deaths shot upwards , increasing 66.6 % over the previous year . 
Barroso Appeals to All Sides to Compromise in Talks of Future Position of Kosovo

( Winter Olympics - Stimulants ) News Analysis : Pyleva Incident Likely to End Inconclusive 
Xinhua News February 17 from Turin . News Analysis : Pyleva incident likely to end inconclusive 
Xinhua News reporter Gao Peng and Ding Ying 
Although Italy repeatedly issued orders saying that all athletes discovered using stimulants during the Turin Olympics would likely face " the specter of jail ; " however , looking at various circumstances it seems that the main character in the first stimulant scandal of this Winter Olympics , Russian biathlon athlete Olga Pyleva , will not likely face jail - time . 
The Turin Olympic Committee revealed the first stimulant scandal of the games on February 16 . It was discovered that Olga Pyleva used the prohibited stimulant Carphedon . 
The next day , the International Olympic Committee announced that Pyleva had already been expelled from the Winter Olympics , and the gold medal she won in the women 's biathlon 15 km individual race at this Winter Olympics had already been stripped from her . 
The International Biathlon Union passed a punitive decision to ban Pyleva from competition for two years . 
It has always been that the International Olympic Committee stipulated that athletes discovered using stimulants at the Olympic Games would have their scores cancelled and have their qualifications for taking part in events taken away , but they would not receive the punishment of the law . 
However , according to Italian law , athletes carrying and using stimulants is considered criminal behavior and judicial authorities have the right to directly arrest and investigate the athlete using stimulates . Those defying the law face anywhere from three months to three years in prison . 
Last December , the International Olympic Committee and the Italian Government concluded " negotiations " that had lasted as long as a year , finally reaching an agreement that both sides would deal with athletes using stimulants according to Italian Law at this Winter Olympics . 
After the tireless efforts of the International Olympic Committee , Italy gave a concession four days before the opening ceremony for the Winter Olympics , promising that during the Winter Olympics police would not enter the Olympic village and search the residences of athletes . However , athletes that showed positive for drugs would still be investigated by Italian authorities . 
Reports state that Mario Pescante , the official supervising the Turin Olympics for the Italian government , has already handed over the Pyleva stimulant incident to Turin investigating authorities . 
However , the International Olympic Committee and Pescante have not confirmed this as of present . 
Russian team doctor for the biathlon team Andrey Dmytriev revealed on February 17 that Pyleva had already left Turin and returned to Russia . 
Chinese Sports Official Shi Liancheng , who worked for many years at the world anti - stimulant organization , believes that as soon as Pyleva returns to Russia , this incident 's ending will likely be " inconclusive . " 
Shi Liancheng said that the International Olympic Committee and the Italian government have never " thoroughly resolved " the anti - stimulant problems at the Winter Olympics , and although the Italian investigating authorities have indeed come into play , the results are hard to predict . 
Looking at the punishments in judgment of cases of domestic athletes using stimulants in Italy , the most serious punishments that offenders have received is no more than " two years of suspended imprisonment . " 
Therefore , senior reporter Pieri of Italy 's Ansa News expressed that the likelihood of Pyleva going to prison is " extremely small , " and at most a fine will be given . 
Pieri expressed that although Italian courts can carry out sentencing without the accused present , Italian police are not likely to go abroad to bring Pyleva back for punishment . 
If Pyleva refuses to accept the judgment , then Italy will have no way to get her . 
Summarized News : New Epidemic Outbreaks Continue to Appear , All Nations of the World Solemnly Guard Against Bird Flu 
Xinhua News February 18 from Beijing . General Xinhua News reporters stationed abroad report that the bird flu has further spread into the African mainland . 
The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed on February 17 that Egypt already has discovered three regions where birds have died of the bird flu virus . 
In Europe , France discovered the H5 bird flu virus for the first time . There is a high level of alert in Europe and Africa , and they are strengthening their epidemic prevention measures . 
Hasan al - Bushra , WHO regional advisor for the eastern Mediterranean , stated to News media on February 17 in Egypt that at present birds that died of the H5N1 bird flu virus have been discovered in the three regions of Cairo and Giza in central Egypt and El Minya in southern Egypt . Relevant departments of the Egyptian government have already started to cull domestic fowl suspected of having bird flu . 
Experts point out that Egypt is an important corridor for migrating birds in the Middle East and North Africa , and the likelihood that migrating birds brought the bird flu virus into Egypt 's borders is very great . 
Egypt has already announced that it is prohibiting importing live fowl from abroad , and has strengthened quarantine inspections along its borders and coasts . 
A chicken farm in the capital of Cameroon , Yaounde , has already had over 800 chickens die mysteriously within the last week . 
Cameroon has already decided to temporarily stop at once all fowl and pork imports from Nigeria , where a bird flu epidemic has broken out . Cameroon also temporarily stopped all trade of fowl and related products in all markets along the border of the two nations . 
The Cameroonian government has in a short period of time set up an epidemic monitoring network that covers the entire border . That nation 's Pasteur Center and the national veterinary labratory already are in a state of emergency awaiting orders to prepare for labratory tests for the H5N1 virus that could begin at any time . 
In Europe , on February 17 Denmark and Sweden began to rule out the epidemic has hit within their borders . 
Sweden 's veterinary research institute released laboratory tests of dead swans discovered last Wednesday , showing that Sweden 's swans were not infected with the bird flu virus . 
Results of the initial laboratory tests of Denmark 's national veterinary management administration show that the 30 dead swans recently discovered within the borders of Denmark did not have the bird flu virus . 
However the ministry of agriculture expressed that Demark still cannot be worry - free . 
Romania in Eastern Europe has already seen nine bird flu epidemic outbreaks this year . Experts of the WHO said on February 17 in Bucharest that virtually all areas of the delta region of the Danube River have bird flu , and this situation must be dealt with seriously . Romania is expected to be threatened by the bird flu for the next 3 to 5 years . 
In Asia 's Bangladesh , the government has taken all needed steps to prevent bird flu . 
The government 's domestic animal service ministry provided books concerning how to prevent bird flu to relevant officials , and also organized training for domestic fowl raisers . 
( Best of Selected Periodicals and Newspapers ) China 's First Shared Blood Information Management System Established in Zhejiang 
Xinhua News February 18 from Beijing . According to information revealed by Zhejiang 's Blood Center , China 's first Shared Blood Information Data Management Control Network System has recently been formally established and put into use at that center . 
A relevant authority of the Zhejiang Province Blood Center said that this means that any citizen can participate in no - compensation blood donation in any county ( city , district ) blood collection and supply clinic now and in the future . Each donor will have a unique coded record ; and when they donate blood again , as long as their relevant coded record is typed in , their personal information , blood type , blood donation record , last time of blood donation , and if they can participate 
This authority further explained that when inputting the relevant record , if the system displays that the interval period since the last no - compensation blood donation of that donor is not up yet , then it will indicate that that person does not meet requirements for blood donation at that time . 
In this way not only is the health of blood donors protected , but the system will also more effectively protect the health and safety of those who need blood . 
Besides this , when blood supplies are tight , blood donors and their family members will have preference for blood use . One only needs to input the valid identification of blood donors and the blood donor 's information will immediately be displayed , it 's quite convenient . 
According to reports in Hangzhou 's " Jinri Zaobao " newspaper , at present this information system already has gone into use at the 36 blood collection and supply clinics across the province . The resources of the entire province 's blood collection and supply clinics are also displayed real - time , realizing data sharing for the entire province . 
To Prevent Another Mountain Landslide Philippines Urgently Evacuates 11 Villages 
Xinhua News February 18 from Manila . Regional Philippine officials said on Februrary 18 that 11 villages in the eastern Philippines are urgently being evacuated to prevent other similar mountain landslides . 
Southern Leyte Provincial Official Rosette Lerias said that day that these villages are located in the same region as the village where the mountain slide happened on February 17 , and have similar characteristics . 
The evacuated residents of the 11 villages will be placed in seven evacuation centers . 
Lerias said that the government ordered residents to evacuate yesterday , and today sent people to investigate these villages because some people were not willing to leave their homes . 
On February 17 a mountain landslide occurred in a mountainside village in Saint Bernard in South Levte Province of the Philippines . From TV coverage , it appeared mud and rocks had already covered the entire village , and only several rooftops were visible . 
Because the mud was extremely damp and the humidity was very high , the hope that people buried under the mudslide can survive is extremely uncertain . 
At present 109 have been discovered dead , with 57 rescued alive . 
According to estimates , this incident is likely to see death tolls reaching as high as 1,800 people . 
( Overseas Chinese ) Min 'nan Overseas Chinese Quanzhou 's Exports See Year on Year Growth of 35.2 % in First Month 
Xinhua News February 19 from Fuzhou ( reporter Guo Yu ) . This January , foreign trade exports of Quanzhou City continued to maintain a trend of high speed growth . 
According to customs statistics , in January Quanzhou realized exports of 330 million RMB , setting its best historic results with year on year growth of 35.2 % , higher than the average level of growth of the entire province . 
According to the analysis of the Foreign Trade and Economics Ministry of Quangzhou , the reason that Quanzhou 's foreign trade could grow so rapidly is mainly because of the effect of several service measures to assist foreign trade , the active high growth of enterprise exports , the vigorousness of Quanzhou economic performance , the strengthening of enterprises ' economic confidence , and a highly effective free - flowing foreign trade development environment . 
< HEADLINE > Hope but No Assurance for Championship 
< POSTER > Love life love Luneng 
The battle field of China 's Soccer Superbowl will soon see war ¡ £ 
The Luneng Taishan ( of Shandong Province ) soccer team is getting ready for the next season , preparing to make another advance for the championship . 
Three strong teams , Dalian , Luneng , and Shanghai , will fight for the championship 
In the end , who will be the champion ? 
According to analysis of their strength , although the Luneng team has great hope of winning the championship , it does not have 100 % assurance . 
First of all , the new players only have a short time to train and be broken in . 
Last year Luneng came home empty from the four big games . 
This year Luneng has brought in two famous national players , Li Leilei and Wang Liang , and soon there will be two foreign players that will join the ranks as well . The team 's power can be said to have had increases and no decreases . 
However , because the national team must prepare for competitions with Pakistan and Iraq , the national players won 't be able to practice with their team mates . 
When they finally return to their club , the tournament will begin shortly ; 
thus the breaking in and integration of new players is the biggest problem faced by Luneng . 
I think that in the first few rounds of the tournament they should let the national players play second string . 
Firstly they can use the competitions to break in and integrate the ranks , 
and secondly they can allow these players who played in two national group competitions to rest a bit . 
After a few rounds , when the 'knives ' are broken in , it will not be too late for them to come into play . 
Also , the team has hidden trouble with its defense . 
In the past , Luneng 's defense has been denounced by fans , 
This year , with the addition of Li Leilei , the team 's defense has improved but is far from being foolproof . 
The problem of middle rear guards being slow at turning around the ball still exists , and second string players are either too old or lack experience . 
If middle rear guards are stable in their abilities this year , then another step will be taken toward Luneng 's road to the championship . 
I believe that the team should use Ren Yongshun , whose physical condition is good . Although he lacks experience , he can train this year , and prepare for the present and future . 
Besides this , Gao Yao is good at playing both forward and rear positions . 
Luneng has many players that can play center field , Cui Peng and Hai Bin can play this position . 
Gao Yao 's body is strong , he 's good at stealing the ball , and in the position of middle rear guard he should be able to do a good job . 
Once again , if the foreign players will be suitable or not is a problem . 
Foreign players are a big problem that has always complicated Luneng . 
Last year , the unleashing of Ionel Danciulescu left many unimpressed , 
and selections for this year 's foreign players have still not been made . 
I think that this year , besides bringing in a extraordinary forward , they should also bring in a pure left forward guard , 
Except for Xing Rui from several years ago , Luneng doesn 't have a left footer in the true meaning . 
Although Cui Peng and other can live up to the position , a true left forward guard would be much better than guest players . 
If these three problems are resolved , Luneng 's road to gain the championship should be more even . 
As a Luneng fan , I hope that Luneng wins the championship this year , 
However , to tell the truth , the shape of this year 's championship has Luneng with great hopes but no great assurances . 
< HEADLINE > Batey Ads Merges with JWT.com ; Is it Too Late to Say Happy New Year ? 
< POSTER > BrandVista Post : 
Hello everybody , 
Spring festival has once again run past us just like that , and those friends who put their vacation time and their Spring Festival holiday break together are one by one returning to their jobs . 
Wishing all friends a happy New Year , if I say happy New Year now it doesn 't count as too late . 
One day I was chatting with NPLCN in a cafe , and he talked about today 's BrandVista . 
The website is much more beautiful , 
the placement of content isn 't bad , 
and what he liked most was the community BBS based on Discuz , which is now getting a comprehensive update . 
Mentioning the community , I must thank a certain person , 
that is the General Manager of the Discuz Beijing Company , Mr. Li Mingshun . 
Doing a search on Google with his name , you 'll get many results ; 
you probably know that before he was at Sina , he established a business himself , making a small - and medium - enterprise Internet advertisement exchange platform similar to the foreign adbrite.com . 
At that time I argued with him on MSN that his main meaning was : Vista thinks the development of many of China 's industries relies on the strengthening of the private economy and small and medium industries , 
and currently in the Chinese market , this situation does not allow people to be optimistic ; 
thus creative industries and similar consultative agencies in service of small and medium enterprises have no way to take shape in any scope , 
and demand a relatively high fee to facilitate self development , finally leading to a recurring cycle that is not encouraging . 
Later he came to Discuz . 
Discuz is a truly outstanding community program based on the PHP and MySQL databases ; 
with the help of Beijing technical engineer Ramboo , the BrandVista community finally saw light once again , and came into the market in full force . 
Feedback has been very good , 
the user interface is clean and friendly , 
the speed is fast ; 
under a spotlessly clean user interface , writing a little text that leaves me inspired and others enlightened , and exchanging every little fact about life and work with friends and coworkers with the same pursuits , I began to believe that this is a kind of joy . 
Thank you Discuz ! 
News in the advertisement industry of late is rather substantial . 
Beginning in January , the WTO 's opening up of institutions related to the advertisement industry will begin to be implemented . 
Major foreigners have already arrived one after another , and lesser foreigners are sharpening their knives ; it seems to be a scene of prosperity . 
The problems of Batey Ads of Singapore are rather numerous ; 
under the circumstances of consecutively losing several heavyweight customers , and seeing setback after setback on the mainland , Sir Martin finally took a little time from the Italian lawsuit to think about shuffling his cards . 
Batey Ads merged with JWT.com , keeping its brand name , but managed by JWT . 
At the same time , there are also rumors saying Bates and 141 net will soon merge into the Ogilvy system , with management being carried out by Ogilvy Advertising ; 
although before this , 141 already reported to Ogilvy ; allowing Bates to report to Ogilvy is also an interesting matter . 
During Spring Festival , the website had many articles updated ; I won 't tell of all of them here ; 
if everybody has time , you can get onto the website and look at them . 
At the same time , for those friends who have not yet entered the new forums , there is no hindrance for you to click your mouse a little more , and then you can enter BrandVista 's totally new community . 
Feel the environment , experience the atmosphere , contribute some writing . 
I hope you are able to feel and find the happiness of our organization 
Wishing that all friends are in a wonderful mood . 
Best regards !

Look at this article , and share it ; 
this is not an impulse on thought , instead it is warm goodness long held in one 's heart . 
Ask yourself if it were you , what would you have done ; 
the answer is very clear , I would have put down the telephone saying , " wrong number . " 
This year I have been thinking about when all is said and done , what actually counts as helping people . 
I have already abandoned all behaviors like donating money and donating items . 
In the last few days I 've had friends say , I already have no time to care for myself ; in helping people , my heart is full of vigor but by my strength lacking . 
Wishing you a day of happiness : ) 
Helen 
Mother of Ten Years Ago 
It was one day ten years ago when this teacher was using the noon rest time to sleep at her home ; suddenly the telephone rang . 
She received the call and listened , and out came a strange and rough sound : " your child was stealing books and now she 's been caught by us , come quickly ! " 
From out of the receiver also came the noise of a young girl crying , and the sounds of chiding from people surrounding the young girl . 
She looked over at her only daughter who was watching TV , and she immediately understood . 
It was definitely a young girl who was caught by the salesperson stealing books , but was not willing to allow her family to learn of this ; thus , she made up a phone number , and by coincidence it rung at the teacher 's home . 
Of course the teacher could put down the phone and take no notice of this - - she could even rebuke the person on the receiving end , 
because this event had no connection to her whatsoever . 
But she was a teacher , and maybe the girl was her student 
through the telephone , she could vaguely imagine that the little girl who had a momentary lapse in judgment with serious consequences must be extremely nervous and scared ; she was facing perhaps the most frightening circumstances ever in her life . 
After hesitating for a moment the teacher suddenly thought of an idea - - yes , she 'd just do it . 
Therefore , after she got the address of the bookstore , she immediately went there . 
Just as she expected , in the bookstore stood a little girl with a face full of tears , 
and the adults around her were fiercely chiding her . 
She rushed up at once , hugging that poor little girl and turning to the salesperson by her side , saying , " talk to me about this , don 't frighten the child . " 
While the salesperson grumbled that he was not willing , she handed over a fine of several tens of RMB before taking this little girl out of the bookstore and getting a clear look at a face in a complete mess with tears and panic . 
She began smiling and took the little girl to her home , cleaned her up without asking anything , and then allowed the little girl to leave . 
before she left , the teacher urged her : " if you want to read , just come to me ; there are many books here . " 
The little girl whose spirits were still rattled took a good look at her , and then ran off like she was flying , never appearing again . 
Time passed rapidly like running water , and without realizing it , ten years of time had passed in a flash ; 
the teacher had already forgotten this event long ago , but she still lived in the same place , leading a peaceful and serene life . 
One day at noon , a knocking sound came from outside the door . 
After she had opened the house door , she saw a young and beautiful unfamiliar girl , who had a face full of smiles and a large pile of gifts in her hands . 
" Who are you looking for ? , " 
she asked uncertainly . 
The girl then excitingly talked at length . 
With great difficulty , she suddenly discovered from the story told by this strange girl that it turned out she was the little girl from before , ten years before ; she had already graduated from college without any trouble , and now she had gone to the trouble to come to pay a call to the teacher . 
The eyes of this young girl were glinting with tears , and she spoke softly : " Although I still don 't understand even to this day why were you willing to pretend you were my mother and rescue me , I always think , during these past ten years , about how I 've always wanted to call you mother . " 
The teacher 's eyes also began to become fuzzy ; 
she asked with some curiosity : " if that day I had not helped you , what would have been the result ? " 
The girl 's face immediately became somber ; lightly she shook her head and said ; " I can 't say for sure ; perhaps I would have done something stupid , even died . " 
The teacher 's heart suddenly trembled and she began to inwardly congratulate herself . 
The decision that she made in a moment of thought that year could actually influence the life of a person in such a way as this . 
Looking at the happy smiles on the face of the girl she also began to smile .

everybody has a heart of compassion ; 
the moral values of today 's world are worsening , man 's heart is not what it used to be ;

< HEADLINE > Military Survey : How Long Can Iran Last Against American Air Strikes ? 
< POSTER > Yun Feiquan 
If you make the analogy of a traditional war of attrition as making your opponent bleed until he dies , then modern warfare is like firing a gun into your opponent 's head , making him become a 'vegetable ' before he can even begin to bleed . 
The difference between Iran and America 's military does not lie in numbers , instead it lies in the understanding of modern warfare . 
Iran , which fought an eight - year war with Iraq with no clear winner , still seems to not have come to an understanding of the true meaning of modern high - tech warfare . 
In the last few days , after analyzing the redeployment of American forces , England 's " International Intelligence Commentary " pointed out that American forces are currently carrying out preparations to initiate a large scale air strike against Iran . 
The Current Situation of Iran 's Air Force Worrisome 
The current situation of Iran 's air force is relatively similar to Iraq 's air force before the 2003 war . 
Iran does not have the ability to research and develop modern weapons by itself , and also is restricted by a Western arms embargo ; 
as soon as a war breaks out , whether or not the old aircraft in Iran 's air force will be able to get into the air and engage American forces is still a big question . 
At present , Iran 's air defense system is mainly made up of the air forces of Iran 's regular army , land air defense units , and the air defense forces of the Revolutionary Guards . 
Among its forces , Iran 's air force has approximately 50,000 soldiers , and has over 300 war aircraft of various types ; 
its main models include American - made F-4 ' Phantoms ' , F-5 ' Tigers ' , F-14 ' Tomcats ' and Russian - made Mig 29s and so on . 
Land - based air defense units are mainly equipped with a series of American - made ' Hawks ' , British ' Rapiers ' and some Russian - made ' SAM ' land - to - air missiles . 
As to the present situation of Iran 's air defense power , American military expert Harold Hutchinson and Russian Government and Military Analysis Institute military expert Vladimir Mytashin and others have analyzed this . They believe that , looking at the current situation , there still exist some leaks in Iran 's air defense abilities and the air defense system establishment . 
Hutchinson believes that , talking about its comprehensive strength , Iran 's air forces and America 's military are just not on the same level . 
A great number of American - made fighters that Iran is equipped with cannot be used because they lack spare parts and need upgraded maintenance . 
As of now only about 10 or a few more of the F-14 fighters which were once seen as the trump card in Iran 's air force can even get off the ground and fly , 
and the actual battle reliability of the AIM-54 model ' Phoenix ' cruise missile , which is reputed to have over the horizon strike ability , is suspicious . 
Mytashin points out that the air defense missile systems that America supplied to Iran in the 70 's and 80 's have already lost their battle abilities because they lack spare parts , 
and some other air defense weapons not incorporated into their own systems obtained from Russia and other countries have no ability whatsoever to contend with American forces that have strong electromagnetic countermeasures . 
A Pieced Together Force Influences Iran 's Fighting Power 
Iran 's government obviously has recognized that its fate in a war depends on whether or not it can defend the skies above its head , and has thus made preparations at the last minute , and tried to further piece together and strengthen its air defense systems . 
Looking at this at the present , Iran 's method can be boiled down to these two strategies : 
First , hide important nuclear facilities with the utmost effort , and strengthen their ability to resist attack . 
According to England 's " The Times , " Iran already has deeply hidden its Natanz nuclear factory and Isfahan uranium enrichment center 18 meters underground , and added a two - meter thick concrete protecting shell . 
However , American forces are one step ahead . As early as during the 1991 Gulf War , America had seen the efficiency of underground bunkers in air defense warfare and carried out an onslaught of research and development on various kinds of earth - penetrating bombs . 
After more than 10 years of specific research and development , American forces now already have a whole series of battle methods and weapons to deal with underground reinforced bunkers . 
Recently Iran also purchased advanced air defense weapons from Russia . 
Since late last year , the Iranian government and Russia have successively reached agreements on the purchase of ' Pechora ' 2A model air defense missile systems , as well as 29 ' Tor " M1 model air defense missile systems worth 700 million USD . 
However , modern warfare is a measuring of system against system . 
All of America 's various air strike weapons were researched and developed by America , have seen many years of actual battle hardening , and have already been ground into a set of battle machines with objective effectiveness . 
Whereas Iran has been piecing together 'new weapons ' from other countries . It is still a question if Iran can create any battle power in such a short time . 
Iran 's Deficiencies Not Only in Weapons 
The ' AirLand Battle ' concept was first brought up in " Operations " published by the U.S . armed forces in 1982 . It emphasized taking advantage of air superiority to carry out strikes on the enemy 's strategic high value targets , and paralyzing the command system of the enemy as soon as war began , making enemies with even large and strong regular armed forces just " a piece of meat on the cutting board . " 
In the 1991 Gulf War , the 1999 Kosovo War and the 2003 Iraq War , what American forces have been concerned about is not how many aircraft the opponent has , but instead the range of its ' Tomahawk ' cruise missiles . 
The Iranian government is already carrying out preparations for air strikes that might happen , and has also begun procedures to strengthen its air defense abilities . However , Iran , which fought an eight - year war with Iraq with no clear winner , still seems not to have come to an understanding of the true meaning of modern high - tech warfare . 
With the progress of military restructuring of American forces over the past few years , America 's air strike performance is already totally different than the carpet bombing of the Vietnam era , and instead relies on various high - tech weapons , the support of high accuracy current information technology and total - depth air strike ability . 
Facing these kind of air strikes , exactly how long Iran 's land - based air defense systems can last is still an unknown .

< HEADLINE > Joining With Google to Take on Microsoft , Dell Takes " Shelving Fees " From Software Providers 
< POSTER > Yun Feiquan 
Dell ( Dell Inc . US ) and Google verified on Tuesday that Dell is currently testing the installation of a Google software package on personal computers . 
This move will likely become a serious threat to the leading position in the personal computer software market of Microsoft ( Microsoft Corp , MSFT ) . 
Jess Blackburn , news spokesman for Dell , expressed that his company is currently evaluating Google 's software . 
After installing this software , personal computer users can use it to carry out searches on the Internet and also search the information saved on personal computers . 
Blackburn verified that at present the software his company is evaluating includes a Dell homepage supported by Google , a Google desktop search system and a Google tool bar . 
At the same time , Google news spokesman Jon Murchinson verified his company is currently testing a batch of software developed by Google with Dell . 
Before this , " The Wall Street Journal " had a report saying that IT parvenu Google is currently carrying out talks with Dell , HP ( Hewlett - Packard ) and others , aiming to convince these computer manufacturing giants to install Google software on their computers . 
According to " The Wall Street Journal , " which cited a person with inside information , to reach this goal Google will likely pay as much as one billion USD to Dell over the next three years . 
However , neither of the two companies has revealed any relevant details . 
Besides this , HP has declined to comment . 
Microsoft news spokesperson Neil Charney refused to comment on the above news . 
At present , Microsoft is currently planning to release the search tools of the next generation Windows operating system , as well as strengthening the development of its online services . 
The day that this news became public , Google stock once again fell by 4.46 % , reaching 367.92 USD . 
Microsoft stock fell 1 % that day , closing at 26.94 USD . 
Some analysts point out that Google is currently impatiently searching for a direction for expansion besides internet searches , and joining with Dell and other PC giants will spur Google on to threaten Microsoft 's central services . 
Analyst Matt Rosoff of market research company Directions on Microsoft expressed that Google is impatient to expand new income flows . This is certainly what Microsoft is concerned and worried about . 
However , there are also analysts who don 't think so . 
Analyst Charles Di Bona of market analysis company Sanford C. Bernstein pointed out that it is still too early for Google to shake Microsoft Windows ' leading position . 
Noted by the Reporter : Google Loosening Up Microsoft 's Empire ? 
Hui Zhengyi 
There is no doubt that computers have already become a necessity of life and work . 
However , while everybody is familiar with operating computers , there are only a small number of people who actually understand the principles that make computers work . 
Just like using 'simpleton ' cameras , as long as the user interface is good and you use convenient software , the great majority of dummies can still thoroughly enjoy their computer . 
Because of this , the software that PC producers provide when they ship their goods often decides the use habits of a large number of consumers . 
Microsoft has firmly taken hold of the personal computer operating system market through this measure . 
As of now , Microsoft 's new opponent Google also intends to use this method to take a share for itself . 
A famous Taiwanese economic media outlet recently gave an interesting analogy to this . 
" Dell , HP and other computer producers are starting to manage the computers they are sending out as the product shelves in a supermarket , and taking a " shelving fee " from software companies . 
Successful bidders can make their software appear in the 'crucial 10 minutes ' when users first turn on their new computers , and lead consumers to use their products . 
This type of fee pattern is like supermarkets taking a shelving fee from food suppliers . " 
There is no doubt that this phenomenon shows that Microsoft 's control is currently loosening . 
Microsoft managers have warned Bill Gates that if Google starts to pay personal computer manufacturers to allow computers to be deployed with Google 's software , then Microsoft 's hegemonic position will in the end be threatened . 
No matter what the final result is , the leisurely days of Microsoft sitting in the lead position will likely become history . 
After all , fighting an empire is easy , but defending an empire is hard .

Sword of Righteousness : Looking Forward to 2006 
Author : sword of righteousness 
I remember at the beginning of 2005 , Hong Kong 's " Apple Daily " published an article ; its title was " The Falun wheel turns often to capture the enemy nation . " 
The article said that 2004 was a year in which Falun Gong advanced triumphantly . 
The article enumerated that all the manners in which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) overseas officials took to repress Falun Gong in various situations all failed , and students of Falun Gong across the world spoke the truth and left the CCP without any face . 
But if you compare the great surge of those quitting the party because of the " Nine Criticisms " of 2005 , then 2004 really doesn 't seem like much . 
So , what will 2006 bring ? 
From two events that happened early this year we can get an inkling as to the development of this year . 
The first event is the publishing of " Eradicating Evil . " This article pronounces a sentence that the final day of the CCP 's special operatives after July 20, 1999 will soon arrive . 
In regards to this article , perhaps many people will waver between believing or doubting it , or will not be able to believe it , 
but no matter if you believe it or not , history and fact will provide proof ! 
Of course , the special operatives of the CCP are just like rats that live in the sewer , 
their " natural or unnatural " death will not bring the attention of society or public opinion , 
However , the large - scale smiting or repentance of domestic and foreign based CCP operatives will bring about a huge attack and convulsion to the CCP power hierarchy ! 
Under the awful magnitude of the smiting of their world , they will have to seriously consider their path of retreat and path of life - - quit the party , revolt and run , or change sides . 
Because of this , the ' CCP hyper - stable bureaucratic system bloc ' held up by filthy interests will begin to shake , dissolve and collapse ! 
There is also one event , that is , the hunger strike movement against those maintaining power begun by Gao Zhisheng . 
This movement that began suddenly and was not well received at first , exceeded expectations and received an enthusiastic response from all over the world , and was responded to jointly by figures and forces everywhere . 
If this movement can become a nexus between various righteous powers and the suffering people , as well as become successful and large , then the final hit to the CCP , this wicked regime that is on the precipice ready to fall , will be given . 
If we say that 2005 was the year that defeated communism on the spiritual level , then 2006 is the stage of defeating communism on a spiritual and material level . 
With the further promulgation of the " Nine Criticisms , " the deepening of the tide of people quitting the party , the self - dissolution of the CCP itself and the agglomeration and shaping up of outside righteous power , the life of the CCP monster will formally enter its final hours ! 
The desires of heaven and earth have already coalesced , the hand of God and the power of the people are currently assembling . 
The long sword that relies on heaven is directly pointed at the CCP monster ! 
If you say 2004 was a year in which we advanced triumphantly , and 2005 is a year in which we surged forward with great momentum , then what will the end words be for 2006 ? 
I hope it will be a huge change that startles heaven , victory and triumphant return !

< HEADLINE > Xu Zhiyong : a Letter to Linyi City Committee Secretary Li Qun 
< POSTER > Fabuer 
Poster : sunnypku ( sunny ) , 
Letter area : square 
Title : Xu Zhiyong : a Letter to Linyi City Committee Secretary Li Qun - Gangster Methods Will Hurt You 
Posting Website : Like old friends even though we just met ( Wed Feb 8 13:56:14 2006 ) , this website ( yjrg.net ) 
As of yesterday , the Linyi government that you lead has already illegally held Chen Guangcheng under house arrest for 165 days . 
You have joined with the gangster underworld to illegally imprison a legal citizen who has been blind in both eyes for a long time . 
You cut the telephone line in his home , and installed cell phone disrupting equipment in his courtyard . 
You have also beaten up his family members on numerous occasions . 
Your barbaric actions have already passed beyond the bottom margin of civilized society . 
In October 2005 you used gangster methods to beat up me and lawyer Li Fangping , but we endured it , and always did our best to understand your difficulties , even tolerating you putting Chen Guangcheng under house arrest for a time . 
However , 165 days have passed , and you have not constrained yourselves , and instead have become even more severe . 
You send out large teams of police and gangsters to harass the village citizens . 
You continue to arrest and beat up village citizens . 
You have already gone too far ! 
Today , while you continue to organize gangsters to surround and block Cheng Guangcheng , I clearly remind you that gangster methods will in the end hurt yourself . 
The beginning of the situation is worth your looking back and thinking about . 
Linyi 's Family Planning is dead last for the entire province , 
and as the secretary of the city committee , you being somewhat worried is understandable . 
However , thinking that you can only use violence and force to implement national legal policies because Linyi 's citizens are unsophisticated is wrong . 
Citizens not cooperating with the behavior of the government , in the end whose fault is this ? 
Is it because citizens are unsophisticated , or is it because the government has for a long time used lies and deceits leading to very low public confidence ? 
If you say that 10 years ago this kind of governmental behavior still didn 't seem that preposterous ; then in 2005 , when Chinese society has already had obvious improvements and human rights protection has already been added into the constitution , don 't you think that your barbaric behavior is far off the mark ? 
Why don 't you think about it a bit ? Why is it only you guys in Linyi that still dare to do stuff like this ? 
How is it that you guys in Linyi cannot use democratic and legal methods to enforce the law ? 
When Chen Guangcheng and a group of brave citizens reported the facts of this barbaric enforcing of the law , through the involvement of Teng Biao and a group of lawyers bravely maintaining the rights of citizens and after the State Family Planning Committee completed its investigations , Linyi City could have heartily given an explanation and come to an understanding with the public . 
After all , family planning is a problem characteristic of China . 
Everybody could have understood and forgiven your difficulties . 
However , you took further absurd actions - catching Chen Guangcheng in Beijing and bringing him back . You also implicated him in the crime of illegally providing national confidential information . 
Don 't you think that this crime is rather absurd for a blind person who lives in a poor mountain village ? 
Actually , you only need to correct your mistakes , you only need to do good . Do you really fear the criticism of a blind person ? 
Do you really have to assign over 10 people to watch over him 24 hours a day and even try to pin utterly preposterous crimes onto him ? 
On October 4, 2005 , Lawyer Li Fangping and I went to the ancient village of Dongshi where we expressed an extremely clear standpoint hoping to resolve this contradiction . 
We suggested that we first talk with your officials , and see what ideas and demands you had . 
We took the initiative and suggested we would help you persuade Chen Guangcheng not to say certain things . 
We hoped that you wouldn 't treat a blind person in such ways , and both parties should have concessions . 
However , your decision maker insisted on doing things his own way and he even set up a " meticulous scheme " of his own - to beat us up and illegally detain us . 
Do you think you can frighten us into submission in this way ? 
We have done nothing against the law , 
we have no fear , 
and although China 's rule of law is not perfect , it is not that there is no law and no heaven above . 
Do you think you can frighten us into submission by using gangster methods ? Then you have seriously underestimated our resolve and perseverance . 
As long as we are willing , we have many people and many legal reasons to go to Linyi , or go and see Chen Guangcheng . 
You can beat up lawyer and scholar once , twice , three times ; every time will be widely reported and paid attention to . 
Do you really dare to beat us 10 times ? 
Are you not very concerned with your official post ? 
If there is anybody who is really hurt , is your official position that secure ? 
If you do not listen to our reasonable advice , and instead employ some low - level gangster methods , don 't you think this is very dangerous and very foolish ? 
I want to clearly tell you that in China there are many outstanding citizens who obey the law and are true to their consciences . 
We aren 't afraid of the gangster underworld , 
and we cannot abide the wanton trampling of the lowest margin of human civilization . 
If you go too far , we will confidently and calmly face your clubs with group after group and go forward until you finally shrink back . 
It should be clear to you , using gangster methods is nothing good for you . 
Don 't think that you can hide behind a curtain and be free of your relationship with those ruffian gangsters who beat up villagers . 
In the end , I want to remind you , please be nice to Chen Guangcheng . 
This person who has been blind since childhood , graduated from the Institute of Chinese Medicine , self - studied law and English , once sued Beijing 's Subway Company to get better benefits for the blind , brought running water to the villagers , and became the famous " Lawyer Chen " known near and far . 
You went as far as using shameless persons to slander him on the Internet , and also tried to frame him with the crime of illegally providing confidential information to foreigners . Don 't you think that you have gone too far ? 
Your house arrest of Chen Guangcheng is illegal , and is dangerous to you as well . 
Originally you could have released him , 
and although your barbaric execution of the law would have stopped , even if he criticized you , how long could he go on ? 
Instead , today you are continuing to further debase your own image . 
As long as Chen Guangcheng does not get freedom , you will not get one day of rest . 
Your torture of him is already enough , 
and if you still want to pin a crime on him or still want to utilize further gangster methods , we will definitely not stand to the side and just watch . 
Citizen Xu Zhiyong , February 8, 2006 . 
< HEADLINE > ( fwd ) Does the Chinese Ethnicity Deserve Democracy ? 
< POSTER > Exploring China 's peaceful path to liberation , pushing for the internal liberation of my countrymen . 
I am extremely disappointed to admit : The Chinese ethnicity does not deserve democracy ! ! ! 
Aren 't the people posting here doing just this thing ! 
It 's just sad that people on the Internet seeing this are not many ( compared to 1.4 billion ) , 
The number of people who are online and are concerned and take part in these types of subjects is even smaller : I am confident in asserting - they are less than 1 % of those that use the Internet ! 
And what about this Internet having the largest , most comprehensive , most advanced , most expensive , and best security programs in the world ! 
Indeed . 
Agony , disappointment , helplessness , even thinking of submission ; but to live one 's life , besides fighting yourself , who can you place hope on ? 
Although the planning of affairs rests with man , to complete affairs rests with heaven . Still , even if my plans do not succeed , if I do not work hard towards my ideals I will believe that I myself am wrong and deserve to live the life of a dog . 
Working hard towards righteousness , I will add some beauty to my life in this way alone , at least in my heart and in my appraisal of myself . 
In fact , I don 't need to be worried with China 's future at all , 
because the world environment already cannot allow a regime that for a such a long time has not used elections . 
It 's only a matter of time . 
It 's just that I sigh that the Chinese ethnicity is 'extremely lucky ' , we have always been put on a hellish path of torture and awfulness during the turns of history by world classed and superman classed monsters . Even though some call the high piles of bones and pools of blood this path extracts as glorious , and force us to be proud of our gloriousness . 
Dark nights are everywhere , China is endless . 
With China 's first emperor Qinshihuang and Confucius , the people violently died young . 
Qinshihuang was openly a tyrant , Confucius brain washed covertly . 
It 's not that Chinese are not deserving of democracy , it 's that the genes of democracy have already been repressed . 
For a nation that has been around for three thousand years , if its ethnic culture had democratic genes , then this nation would have much earlier become a democracy . 
When Athens established a democratic system , when Rome established a republic , when the English passed the Magna Carta , when the French published the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen , when Americans published the Declaration of Independence , what were the Chinese doing ? 
Before the Mongolians came into the central China plains , the Mongols elected a leader at the Kurultai , the Manchurians had democratic discussions of government between the King and ministers , why is it when they came to the Han region these tendencies were put out ? 
The Chinese pursue material resources , and have no interest whatsoever in spiritual beliefs and political power . 
I don 't believe it . If Chinese had universal suffrage , they 'd sell it for a salty pancake . 
500,000 years later , if the Chinese want democracy , then there will certainly need to be an earthquake ; those who can run , run !

Special Envoy of the Dalai Lama Carries Out Closed Meetings with Chinese Officials 
The Dalai Lama has emphasized that he hopes Tibet will be autonomous but not independent . 
The special envoy of the Dalai Lama , exiled Tibetan spiritual leader , is currently in Beijing carrying out closed meetings with Chinese officials , but the details have not been released . 
This is the fifth formal meeting with the exiled government of the Dalai Lama since 2002 when China reinstated ties . 
However , it 's the same as before , both sides are carrying out closed meetings and the details have not been revealed . 
Reporters say that both sides have carried out multiple talks , but as of now they still do not have any results of real substance . 
The Dali Lama , exiled in north India , said that he hopes for Tibet to be autonomous , not independent . 
China refused to comment on the two party talks . 
However , analysts say that Beijing looks forward to the two party talks , some reasons being that it 's worried if the 70 year old spiritual leader dies , it will likely lead to an increase of unsatisfactory sentiments of Tibetans toward Chinese rule . 
Cultural Identity 
The delegation of the Dali Lama 's exiled government are lead by Kelsang Gyaltsen . He has also been the leading representative for the past several meetings . 
The spokesperson for the Tibet exiled government said that the several talks carried out with Chinese officials in Switzerland in 2005 were extremely " confidential and frank . " This brings hope to Tibetans . 
The spokesperson said that their final hope is to reach a groundwork with the Chinese leadership according to the talks , resolve relevant problems , allow Tibetans to have freedom , and maintain their cultural identity which they believe is important . 
< POSTER > CGP Beili 
Special Envoy of Dali Lama has Repeated he Does Not Seek Independence 
The Dali Lama will go to Washington this month . 
Before the Dali Lama , the Tibetan spiritual leader , arrives in America on November 8 , his special envoy expressed that the exiled Tibetan government does not demand Tibetan independence . 
Kelsang Gyaltsen said in Washington that they hope the Chinese government can indeed protect the unique culture and traditions of Tibet . 
It 's predicted that when the Dali Lama visits America next week he will discuss the problem of Tibet with President Bush , and hope Bush will urge the Chinese government to give Tibet true autonomous power . 
The Dali Lama 's representatives and Beijing officials carried out direct contact this July in Berne . 
" True Autonomy " 
Kelsang Gyaltsen pointed out that in the last several years the Tibet exiled government and Chinese authorities have see some positive aspects during talks . 
The special envoy of the Dali Lama discovered that Beijing leaders , especially representatives of the United Front Work Department of CPC Central Committee were willing to listen to their viewpoints . 
However , Kelsang Gyaltsen said that the Tibet exiled government and the Chinese government still had too many divergences , and the standpoint of both sides had too great a difference . 
He said that in the last five years , the exiled Tibetan government had already done all it could to respond to China 's demand of creating a good environment for talks , 
and China should also create a good environment for the Tibet problem , and not just attack the Dali Lama . 
He said that the Dali Lama does not demand Tibetan independence , and Tibet is a part of China , but the Chinese government must protect the unique culture of Tibet and " allow Tibetans to truly have autonomy . " 
Besides this , Kelsang Gyaltsen pointed out that some Chinese think that once the Dali Lama dies , the Tibet problem will disappear . 
He said this way of thinking is extremely dangerous , because once the Dali Lama is not around , China will have lost a historic opportunity to resolve the Tibet problem . 
He said that , as long as the Chinese government is responsive to the demands brought up by the Dali Lama , and puts forth a final method of resolution , the Dali Lama will then not need to discuss the Tibet problem in the international community . 
< HEADLINE > Negotiations and Compromise are Important Methods of Democracy ! (ZT) 
< POSTER > Hou Ze 
I just saw the post of an Internet friend on " Vast Righteousness - Give Old Mr. Gui Ren . " 
His ( her ) original words were : " Negotiations and compromise are important methods of democracy , otherwise democracy will fail because opinions are different and splits form ! ! ! This point should be amply paid attention to by those hoping for ideal democracy ! " 
These light and unflavorful words that did not stir any interest in my online friends got me thinking and lamenting . 
At this time I wanted to go to ancient China , and I also wanted to go to the past of the west . 
I , who seldom post main threads , could not help but post a main thread to reply to this post of my online friend . 
First let us look at ancient China . 
Everybody knows that China has been a centralized power since the first emperor , Qinshihuang , established a unified China . After that all dynasties operated under this governmental framework . 
Although in the Han period they implemented a " two track system " for a short time , it was just a governmental system of simultaneous operation of feudalist and central power mechanisms , and in the end central power won out . 
The results of this type of central power system had its progressive side under the historic conditions of the time , and promoted the development of production capability . 
However , we should see that the results of over two thousand years of operating under this system has lead to locations lacking the ingenuity , initiative , and pro - activeness they should have ; and in no way could that system set various governing policies suitable for local development with actions that suit local situations . 
A pyramid - like governing system also led to lower level officials only looking upward , in all respects taking orders from the next higher level . 
Because the local officials of county seats were all appointed by the central government , there was no space for concessions and negotiations , and don 't even bother to bring up the common people . 
When the rights of ancient Chinese farmers were encroached on , they could only endure it . 
Only when their most basic rights were threatened - that is large scale starvation and the right of life being exploited by cruel government or natural disasters - would they raise up flags and resist . 
Over two thousand years numerous peasant rebellions have swept across the nation ; from ones that had no forethought such as that led by Chen Sheng and Wu Guang to the planned Yellow Turban Uprising , and again the Huangchao violence of the Tang Dynasty , and the Li Zicheng uprising that ruled as a dynasty for one month . Except for Zhu Yuanzhang , all of these did not gain victory in the true meaning . 
Even the Ming Dynasty established by Zhu Yuanzhang was no more than the replacing of one dynasty with another , and there weren 't changes in the system of government . 
Zhu Yuanzhang , who was born a commoner and did not have much culture , took China 's ancient centralized power system to an abnormal and extreme state , therein losing the vigorous and vital aspects of freedom and tolerance of the Tang Dynasty that system enjoyed , making the system inert . 
Any room for discussions of freedom disappeared on the Chinese mainland , 
the nature of humanity received the greatest suppression , 
and everyone became overcautious , in awe and reverence of the government , and did not dare to say too much . 
This was the aftermath of the only peasant rebellion that was successful in two thousand years , leaving the Chinese people with a meager existence for a time . 
Now let 's look at the Middle Ages that are called the Dark Ages in Western Europe . 
Western Europe 's Middle Ages was a thousand year era that took shape after western Rome was destroyed by nomadic peoples . These Middle Ages had no connection to ancient Greece and Rome . 
This era 's main characteristic was feudalism , that is dividing up lands ; 
land was divided up further and further among lords and the lower levels had more self - governing rights . 
No matter if one was a small feudal lord of a few square kilometers of land , or a male aristocrat with a royal title ; because those higher and lower could mutually balance , restrict , and rely on each other , they had the conditions and ability to strive for the rights they should have from their king . This produced the situation of kings and aristocrats sitting together and carrying out negotiations for each one 's benefits that was never seen in ancient China . 
They made mutual concessions , and did not use violent methods to beat down and replace opponents . 
In this way , by setting various contracts , power continuously was released into the hands of aristocrats and commoners , the rights of aristocrats and commoners became greater and greater , and the power of the king lesser and lesser . 
Until finally the English Queen was just a empty position , and did not have any real power . 
Democracy was gradually realized in this way ! 
Now look back and compare , in ancient China , where all power was concentrated in the hands of the emperor ( except for Li Shimin of the Tang Dynasty ) with almost no aristocrats , peasants could not easily enjoy a kettle of tea or cup of wine with them at the negotiating table , and mutually compromise in a relaxed and happy way to set up contracts with both sides happy . 
Under this situation , when the right to life was being exploited , they could only take up violent methods to topple the current dynasty , aiming to replace them . 
The result was successive dynasties , from the high point of the Tang Dynasty to the abnormal situation of the Ming Dynasty . 
Comparing Chinese and western history , we learn there seems to be not one western country who in ancient times had such intensified contradictions between those in power and those ruled over as in China . 
There is not one western country that was like ancient China and had endless peasant uprisings . 
In western countries , when the ancient royal households and peasants had contradictions , the aristocrats and commoners appealing for their own benefits thought first to reach resolutions through the method of negotiations , and made some mutual concessions to gradually gain more rights . Only rarely did they take up the method of violence . 
Understanding from this , now that we have entered the 21st century , on the Internet one can still see some fighters of democracy that have received the heritage of utterly absolutist totalitarianism thinking from the Ming Dynasty . 
Also because the poison of the cultural revolution has infested their bodies , these fighters of democracy only talk about overthrowing and toppling and nothing else . 
These ideas are the biggest obstacles to democracy , because these people do not understand that negotiations and concessions are the most important method on the road to realizing democracy . 
< HEADLINE > Cao Xiaoming Enriching Village Cultural Activities , Who Will " Foot the Bill " 
< POSTER > Hou Ze 
This Spring Festival , the author was lucky to go to a mainland village for the Chinese New Year and visit some relatives and friends . 
While infected with the thick atmosphere of the New Year of China 's villages , I was uneasy about the lake of cultural activities in the villages . 
The author discovered in the village of a close friend and relative that in past years whenever this village celebrated Spring Festival , they would organize the villagers and put on a local play called " horse racing lantern , " 
This play uses characters from the Three Kingdoms period as its theme . Adults and children can all play a part in the game and the villagers never get tired of it . 
This countryside has many troupes that performed " horse racing lantern , " they would not only play in that village but also stroll to other villages ; with these troupes coming and going , everything was quite lively . 
But this year this village did not organize the play . 
It turns out that just purchasing a costume for " horse racing lantern " costs a large amount of money . In the past villagers would put together their money to buy costumes , and now these costumes are worn out to where they cannot be worn again . 
The troupes went door to door asking villagers for a little money , but none of the folks were willing to give anything , and other villages of that countryside also had similar situations . 
Without " horse racing lantern , " the village became cold and quiet all of a sudden ; 
adults began to play mahjong , 
children began to play cards , 
and all the villagers said this New Year was boring . 
Setting off firecrackers and playing mahjong became the main scenes in the villages celebrating Chinese New Year . 
The tendency of gambling is incessant despite repeated prohibitions , and tends to spread rampantly . Seeing losses and wins reaching over 10,000 RMB has become a common thing , especially for the large number of farmers returning from jobs in away from the countryside , they have become the main characters seen at gambling halls . 
The hard earned money from a year of work skips away so easily , 
and family disputes brought about by gambling break out frequently ; some even become tragedies with families falling apart or people dying . 
Some farmers say that they not only gamble during the Chinese New Year , but also participate in gambling when they are not farming ; 
if you don 't gamble you have no place to go . 
If you want to do some cultured activities in the village , finding " entertainment " is too hard ; 
not only does the village not have facilities and funds , there is no one to organize them . 
In this aspect , there is no doubt that the practice of Jiangxi Province is a happy note for farmers . 
To enrich the cultural life of the farmer masses , Jiangxi 's provincial government began to implement the " government puts out money , the market operates it , villages and towns build stages , and farmers watch plays " policy since last September . 
Every year the government arranges at least 60 million RMB of special funds for the villages ' cultural causes , sending excellent cultural products to the masses of the villages . 
With the beginning of the Chinese New Year , the government put out another 40 million RMB , for a total of 100 million RMB of special funds to establish villages ' cultural causes . 
The things that have been bought with this special funding are fairly substantial : 
The fund invites various professional cultural and arts performance groups to carry out performances in villages no less than four times every year in every countryside and town . 
It invites all levels of movie companies to organize groups to come to villages and show movies - at least six story films or documentaries every year in every administrative village . 
It organizes and opens up cultural activities for the masses that have local characteristics - at least two to three times each year for every countryside and town . 
From this " shopping list " , it 's not hard for us to see that the government is not just putting out a bit of money and that 's it , but is making painstaking efforts to figure out how to use limited funding to give cultural feasts that exceed the expected values for the vast number of farmers . 
At present , there is not one of the vast number of farmers who is not ecstatically happy about being exempt from the " state grain tax . " 
If all governments could be like Jiangxi 's and " foot the bill " for cultural activities enriching the farmer masses , then this would be another joy for farmers . 
This " joy " would not only allow farmers to escape the mahjong table and become involved in cultural activities , it would also add " bricks and tiles " to the construction of socialist new villages . 
< HEADLINE > Wang Peirong 's Child Being Kidnapped was False Alarm 
< POSTER > peirongwangsohu@gmail.com 
Wang Peirong 's child being kidnapped was a false alarm 
At a little past 9:00 p.m. on January 24, 2006 , Wang Peirong 's child completely related the following : 
On the morning of January 24, 2006 when Wang Peirong 's child was making up for a missed physics class in Xuzhou 's Number Three High School , the gate guard called her out of class . 
The gate guard said to the child that three males of unclear identification had said to the gate guard that because her mother and father were on bad terms , the child , Wang Tianjiao , had not returned home for three days . 
" At present her mother was missing , and we are the managers of her mother 's working unit , and would like to go into the Number Three High School and take the child with us . " 
She said to the gate guard that what these three men said was totally untrue , and would not agree to go with them . 
With the help of the gate guard , the child was not taken away . 
Wang Peirong 's child gave her mother 's manager a telephone call to ask him to confirm this . That manager said he did not send people to Xuzhou 's Number Three High School . 
The child then called her father 's manager . 
When the child called her father 's manager , 
she said that there were three people that came to the Number Three High School to take her away . 
That manager asked : " Why didn 't you go with them ? " 
She answered : " If I went with them I 'd be dead . " 
After saying this the child hung up the phone . 
Listening to Wang Peirong 's child relating this , one feels that the situation was serious and so Wang Peirong reported this to the police . 
On January 25 , the feedback information from the police station was that what was related by Wang Peirong 's child was basically true . 
The police station asked the Chinese University of Mining 's office of security if they sent people to the Number Three High School looking for Wang Peirong 's child . They answered they did not . 
The police stations asked subordinate units of the Chinese University of Mining 's office of security if they sent people to look for the child . The answer once again was no . 
Relevant departments told Wang Peirong and her family to be careful of safety . 
After this incident , leaders of relevant departments of Xuzhou were extremely concerned , 
and through the detective department of Xuzhou 's Ministry of Public Safety , they eliminated the likelihood of kidnapping the child . 
Wang Peirong thanked leaders of relevant departments of Xuzhou city and the detective department of Xuzhou 's Ministry of Public Safety . 
This was a false alarm , and the main reason for this false alarm was likely the gate guard of the Number Three High School . 
The detective department of Xuzhou 's Ministry of Public Safety now has investigated it clearly : On January 24 , three managers of Wang Peirong from the College of Science were urgently looking for Wang Peirong because they could not find her ( as of now nobody knows what had happened to Wang Peirong ) , they thought to look for the teachers of Wang Peirong 's child at the Number Three High School , and ask them if the child was in Xuzhou or not .

Alternatively , if a ordinary person with no power sees injustice and comes out against corruption , he will likely bring about cruel attacks and retributions to himself , 
or have a political collar placed around his neck , and be put in a position to die at any time before he is victorious . 
Comparing the two : the risk in being corrupt is relatively low , the cost of being anti - corrupt is relatively high .
