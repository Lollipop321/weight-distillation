Two Laptops with Inquiry Data on the Cause of Diana 's Death Stolen 
AFP on the 6th , London 
London 's Daily Express noted that two laptops with inquiry data on the 1997 Paris car accident that caused the death of Princess Diana were stolen from the office of a former metropolitan police commissioner . 
The report pointed out that the theft triggered speculation that the computers may contain confidential information of the probe led by former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Stevens . 
However , a Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said that there was no sensitive information or any data linked to the probe in the computers . 
Lord Stevens is the head of Northumbria Police in Britain . His office is located in the vicinity of Newcastle on Tyne . 
The report said detectives with Northumbria Police have been investigating two burglaries in the past ten days . 
One took place on the weekend of January 28 - 29 with the computers and cash taken ; while the other took place last week with nothing lost . 
Northumbria Police also said there was no evidence that the two burglaries were linked to Lord Stevens ' work . 
Stevens has been investigating speculation that the princess of Wales ' death was not directly caused by the car accident . 
Burgess , the royal coroner , ordered to continue investigating relevant evidence in 2004 . 
Princess Diana was killed in a car accident in a Paris tunnel on August 31, 1997 , along with her lover Fayed and their chauffeur . 
After two years of investigation , French Police believed that the tragedy was caused by the chauffeur , who lost control of the car because he was driving fast under the influence of alcohol and prescription drugs . 
Two Warring Sides in Sri Lanka Agreed to Hold Talks in Geneva in Last Ten Days of This Month 
AFP on the 7th , Colombo 
Norway , a peace process mediator , said that Sri Lanka 's warring groups agreed to hold talks in Geneva , Switzerland , on the 22nd of this month , breaking a three - year deadlock in negotiations by the various parties to end decades of bloody ethnic conflicts . 
The breakthrough was achieved after Norway 's peace envoy Solheim met in London with negotiator Balasingham from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelamin . 
The Norwegian embassy here said in a statement , " The parties to the conflict in Sri Lanka , namely , the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , have asked the Norwegian government to assist with holding talks in Geneva during the two days of February 22 - 23 . " 
The two - day talks will focus on how to strengthen a ceasefire agreement that went into effect on February 23, 2002 , but has not been fully followed by both parties . 
The Norwegian embassy pointed out , " The two parties will discuss how they can improve the implementation of the ceasefire agreement . This is also the first time in three years that the two parties have a face - to - face negotiation at such a high level . " 
Solheim said he will lead the Norwegian delegation at the talks . The four LTTE delegates will be led by Balasingham , and the Sri Lankan government will be represented by its health minister . 
He said , " This is a small but important step toward the road to peace . The negotiation process is expected to be tough . " 
The last face - to - face negotiation to resolve the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka was held in Japan in March 2003 , but the LTTE called off the seventh round of negotiations originally scheduled in Thailand in April 2003 .

AFP on the 10th , Turin , Italy 
The opening ceremony of the 20th Winter Olympics was held today in Turin . The delegations from South and North Korea , the two Cold War foes , marched into the stadium together for the entrance formalities . 
Bora Lee , a female speed skater from South Korea , and Han Jong - in , a male figure skater from North Korea , serving as the respective flag bearers for the delegations of the two countries , led the South and North Korean delegations into the Winter Olympics stadium . 
This was the first time that the South and North Korean Olympic delegations had ever marched in together at the Winter Olympics . 
In order to reflect the united spirit of the two sides over the past few years of reconciliation , the South and North Korean delegations marched in together at both the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens . 
North Korea did not participate in the 19th Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City , USA . 
In 1948 , the Korean peninsula was split into capitalist South Korea and communist North Korea . The two sides engaged in hostile conflict during the 1950 - 1953 Korean War . 
After leaders of South and North Korea held a peace summit meeting in 2000 , bilateral relations started to improve . 
Following tradition , the Greek delegation was the first nation to enter the stadium . Among the 80 nations participating in competitions , South Korea was the 22nd and North Korea the 23rd nation to enter the stadium . 
The delegation from host country Italy was the last nation to enter the stadium . As soon as the Italian delegation entered the stadium , enthusiastic cheering and a round of applause erupted throughout the stadium . 
Having Succumbed to Drugs , Fortunately Hoffman Sobered in Time to Start Acting Career 
AFP on the 16th , New York 
Acknowledged as the most likely recipient of this year 's Oscar for best actor , Philip Seymour Hoffman , lead actor in the movie " Capote , " disclosed that he had succumbed to drugs and alcohol when he was young and reckless . Fortunately , he then succeeded in quitting and was able to start his top flight acting career . 
In an interview on US CBS news magazine 60 Minutes , Hoffman softly sighed that in such period he would truly do anything to get drugs and alcohol . 
At that time he was in his early 20s . Having just graduated from New York University 's drama program , he entered into a dazzling society where each day life was so fast - paced and vertiginous that he eventually got dizzy and lost control . 
When he was 22 , he checked into a rehab center , where he kicked his alcohol and drug abuse habits . In his whole life , that was the period of time when he felt most panicked . 
At the upcoming Oscar Awards ceremony to be held next month , the movie " Capote , " in which Hoffman 's role portrays American writer Capote , is acknowledged to be the most likely winner of the best actor award . 
Prior to this , his excellent acting skills have long been recognized and affirmed by several awards , including a Golden Globe Award for best actor . 
The 38 - year - old actor said in the interview that if he had not made up his mind to kick the bad habits before he became famous , he may not have been able to win the Oscar nomination . 
He said that he envies very much those flashy 19 - year - old performers who all of a sudden become famous and rich . 
Panic Strikes as Signs of Bird Flu Grow Widespread in Europe and Nigeria 
AFP on the 16th , Brussels 
Panic strikes as signs of bird flu virus continue to emerge in Europe . 
The European Commission passed an additional measure to set up a " buffer zone " to fully administer the areas in countries where bird flu has been discovered , banning trade and transport of all poultry . 
Eight days after discovery of the pathogenic H5N1 virus in the African country of Nigeria , outbreaks continued to spread to more chicken farms , with signs indicating it has crossed the northern border into Niger . 
Egyptian officials are investigating a sudden incidence of mass chicken deaths on a chicken farm in the south , fearing that the virus may continue to spread . 
With chicken markets in Europe plummeting from the impact of virus incidents , the European Commission reiterated that there is actually no reason to panic . 
Kyprianou , the European commissioner for health and food safety , said it is understandable that the public is concerned , but there is no need to overreact . 
Following an earlier measure creating three - kilometer protection zones and 10 - kilometer surveillance zones around outbreaks of the virus , the European Commission issued an additional new regulation setting up a " buffer zone " in the entire region of Europe where the virus has been discovered . 
An EU official , who declined to be named , said that everyone is on high alert as they process from morning till night news of suspected outbreaks from around Europe . 
So far in Europe , signs of the H5N1 virus have emerged in Austria , Bulgaria , Croatia , Germany , Greece , Italy , Romania , Slovenia , Ukraine , and the European territory of Russia , among other places , almost all found on wild swans . 
Romania discovered its 31st case on the 16th . New cases were also found in Slovenia , Austria , Greece , and on the island of Ruegen in Germany . 
In southern Italy , the bird flu virus was found on two ducks , the first creatures other than wild swans infected with the H5N1 virus in Europe . 
EU officials are now most worried about migratory birds which will soon return from Africa . 
The Nigerian government is stepping up efforts to prevent the virus on the African continent from spreading to humans . 
The Nigerian government announced that poultry in a radius of five kilometers from affected farms , whether threatened by the virus or not , must be destroyed without exception . 
The neighboring country of Niger declared a national alert and allocated 4 million US dollars to an emergency program to monitor the border with Nigeria . 
The newly established national emergency commission said they have received reports that nearly 400 poultry have died in Magaria , which is on the loosely guarded border between the two countries . 
Let 's again direct our attention to the Iran nuclear issue . 
The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed on the 6th that the Iranian government has written a letter to the IAEA requesting for the removal of all the equipment monitoring Iran 's nuclear facilities by the middle of this month . 
Due to the IAEA decision to report the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council , Iran has announced the termination of all its support and cooperation measures on the nuclear issue and will no longer allow the IAEA to conduct snap inspection of its nuclear facilities . 
In response to the current tensions concerning the Iran nuclear issue , Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said in Athens , Greece , that the cooperation between Russia and Iran still exists . 
This will become the motivation for the resolution to the Iran nuclear issue . 
A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that day that Russia 's proposal to Iran for establishing a joint uranium enrichment enterprise in Russia still stands . 
The two sides may conduct negotiations on this issue next week . 
On the same day , Lugar , chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said at the UN headquarters in New York that the US does not endorse Israeli attacks on Iran 's nuclear facilities . 
Some recent news report said that Israeli defense experts said that the Israeli Air Force may deal serious blows to Iran 's nuclear facilities if necessary . 
According to Xinhua News Agency , Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Kislyak said on the 7th that Russia is willing to cooperate with Iran on the nuclear issue so as to help Iran obtain the legal right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes . 
Kislyak said that Russia 's proposal for a joint uranium enrichment enterprise with Iran is still valid now . 
Russia hopes to have negotiations with Iran on this issue in the near future . 
At the end of December last year , Russia submitted a proposal to Iran regarding the establishment of a joint uranium enrichment enterprise by the two countries in Russia . 
Both the EU and the US indicated that they can accept this plan for a compromise . 
However , Iran hopes that Russia can continue to revise the original plan . 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Kong Quan said on the 7th that though the IAEA reported the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council , it did not hand over the agency 's responsibility for handling the Iran nuclear issue to the Security Council . 
Therefore , all parties still need to break the deadlock on the Iran nuclear issue within the IAEA framework . 
According to the IAEA resolution , IAEA Director General ElBaradei will submit a report on the Iran nuclear issue to the Security Council in March . 
The Security Council will make a final decision after evaluating this report . 
We think this resolution is asking Iran to fulfill the relevant Security Council resolution and its commitments without submitting or referring the issue to the Security Council . 
Recently , China has been seeking a peaceful resolution to the Iran nuclear issue through diplomatic channels . 
Kong Quan said that on February 1 , Zhang Yan , director - general of Arms Control and Disarmament Department of China 's Foreign Ministry , and Larijani , secretary of Iran 's Supreme National Security Council and chief nuclear negotiator , held talks on the Iran nuclear issue in Tehran . 
The Chinese side hopes that Iran should pay attention to the key issue of the international community and create conditions for peaceful resolution to the Iran nuclear issue . 
Solving the Iran nuclear issue within the IAEA framework not only conforms to the interests of the Chinese side but also , as we believe firmly , conforms to the interests of all parties concerned . 
For that purpose , we also call upon all relevant parties in the international community again not to abandon diplomatic efforts for this issue . 
Hamas , which is currently forming a new Palestinian autonomous government , officially announced that except for the candidate for prime minister , the name list of the new government 's cabinet has been basically finalized . 
This led outsiders to have a variety of speculations on the candidate for prime minister . 
A senior Hamas official disclosed to the Associated Press on the 8th that Hamas is preparing to nominate al - Khudairi , board chairman ( ( merchant ) ) of the Islamic University in Gaza , as prime minister of the new autonomous government , but this nomination has not been officially submitted to Abbas . 
Backed by Hamas , 50 - year - old al - Khudairi participated in the election of the Palestinian Legislative Council as an independent candidate last month . 
Al - Khudairi never mentioned violence or anything against Israel in his public speech . 
However , he said that Palestine needs internal reforms . 
Currently , a senior Hamas delegation is visiting Cairo and discussing with Egypt on the issue of Hamas forming a new Palestinian government . 
Khalid Mashal , one of the delegates , told the news media on the 8th that in spite of the pressure that has kept coming from the international community and some Arab countries , the Palestinian government formed by the leadership of Hamas will not recognize Israel . 
At the same time , Mashal also warned Abbas in his speech not to willfully change the structure of the Palestinian leadership without prior consultation with Hamas . 
Analysts consider this a response to Abbas 's plan to appoint Interior Minister Yusuf as deputy commander of the security forces . 
However , regarding the issue of forming a new Palestinian autonomous government , Mashal refused to confirm the news that Hamas is preparing to nominate al - Khudairi , board chairman ( ( merchant ) ) of the Islamic University in Gaza , to serve as prime minister of the government . 
Mashal said that the candidate for prime minister has not been finalized . 
Prior to Mashal 's reiteration of refusing to recognize Israel , Marzouk , another Hamas political leader , said in an interview with Egyptian TV that Hamas will absolutely not recognize the legitimate status of Israel , but the new government will continue to keep contact with Israel in various areas , because recognizing Israel or not is a totally different thing from whether to have contact with it . 
Apart from the fresh or old hatred of the three Hamas prime minister candidates against Israel , the issue of the territory has also been a tough question concerning Palestinian - Israeli relations . 
Israeli Acting Prime Minister Olmert said in an interview with Israel TV Channel 2 on the 7th that Israel must separate from Palestine by setting permanent borders . 
This means that Israel will have to withdraw from part of its territories in the West Bank . 
However , Olmert stressed that Israel will continue to control major Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Jordan Valley area and maintain the integrity of Jerusalem .

The Hefei Cement Research and Design Institute is responsible for providing the complete set of equipment and technical services for the cement factory . The construction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2006 .

As for the specific figure of compensation , we do not have any confirmed and specific answer yet . 
Er , we learned that among others there is a four hundred thousand yuan insurance policy for , er , accidental casualties . 
Er , the families have not directly contacted the insurance company for compensation . Rather , their work unit is negotiating with the compensation company , er , the insurance company about the compensation on their behalf . 
Er , that 's all I have learned now . 
OK , thanks , Li Guangyu , for your on - site report .

They believe that these people may have provided some clues , provided some information to the murderers , such as when the Chinese engineers were leaving , arriving , and at what places . 
In addition , they may have also provided some cover for these murderers . 
Well , this is the current focus of police investigation .

Er , when asked about this by our reporter , the police chief replied by saying that this terrorist organization is actually a very loosely structured organization and does not have a full entity . 
Well , er , many people claim they are members of this organization . 
Well , so , as far as the Pakistani side is concerned , they , er , still focus their investigation on many specific individuals .

OK , Tao Ye . 
( ( ) ) 
Eh , we will continue to watch for relevant investigation developments . 
Thanks , Tao Ye , for your on - site report . 
Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen held a press conference at the Prime Minister 's Residence on Tuesday . 
He said that the current development of the incident concerning the cartoons of Muhammad , founder of Islam , is being taken advantage of by extremists . 
He ( ( stated ) ) that Denmark respects all religious beliefs and calls for the same right of everyone . Er , he also called on Muslims to remain restrained and not to appeal to violence . 
At 4:30 p.m. on the 7th , Prime Minister Rasmussen and the foreign minister held a press conference at Denmark 's Prime Minister 's Residence . 
Rasmussen said . 
The violent incidents occurring at the embassies of several European countries are no longer something between Muslim countries and Denmark . 
It is very important for the Danish government and Danish people to get the broad support of the international community to resolve this tough issue . 
We are allied with France . 
Some organizations of other European countries and the United States in Muslim countries are cooperating closely . 
Just a few minutes ago , US President Bush made a phone call here . 
In the phone call , he expressed support for Denmark , standing by Denmark . 
Rasmussen said , we also think that we should resolve this issue through dialogue and tolerance , not through violence . 
We stress freedom and democracy , and respect the precious value of religious belief . 
Today I appeal to people in all Muslim countries to work together to suppress violence and prevent it from spreading . 
We need to resolve the issue through dialogue , not through violence . 
Today we are facing growing international developments of the incident . 
We saw the Danish national flag burnt and the embassy damaged . 
We saw Danish people being considered intolerant people and the enemy of Islam . 
This is wrong . 
Extremists and radicals are taking advantage of the incident of cultural conflict to escalate the situation . 
Rasmussen stressed , we , Denmark and Danish people , are not the enemy of Islam and other religions . 
For generations , Danish people have been pursuing human rights , democracy , and freedom beyond politics . 
We will continue to strive for that . 
This is part of Denmark 's history and also a fundamental part of Danish society . 
Denmark is one of the most tolerant and open countries in the world . 
We respect all religious beliefs . 
We stop violence . 
We believe everyone has equal rights . 
NTD correspondents Li Luo and Dan Ni reporting from Copenhagen , Denmark . 
Angry with the publication of the cartoons of Muhammad , Iranian extremists attacked the Danish embassy in Tehran again on Tuesday , throwing gas bombs . 
In the meantime , a state - owned Iranian newspaper , in retaliation , held a contest on cartoons about the Nazi Holocaust . 
The United States denounced the move as taking the opportunity to reinforce Iranian President Ahmadinejad 's persistent outrageous anti - Israeli practices . 
Some twenty to thirty protesters climbed over the wall and entered the Danish embassy compound in Iran . 
In addition , more than three hundred people threw rocks and gas bombs at the building from outside . 
The day before , student members of Iran 's hard - line militia led hundreds of demonstrators in attacking the Danish and Austrian embassies in Tehran . 
The controversial cartoons were first published by the Jutland Post in Denmark in September of last year . 
They were successively reprinted in other European countries and three Arab newspapers . 
In retaliation , Hamshahri , Iran 's best - selling newspaper , recently announced that it would hold a contest on cartoons depicting the slaughter of Jews by the Nazi Germany . 
The move was strongly denounced by the United States and other countries . 
US State Department spokesman McCormack said that he thinks the move by the best - selling Iranian newspaper Hamshahri was to reinforce Iranian President Ahmadinejad 's vicious anti - Israeli remarks . 
McCormack reiterated the US support of freedom of speech in all parts of the world , including Iran . 
But he thinks Hamshahri 's cartoon contest was totally a different thing from the publication of the cartoons of Muhammad by the Danish media . 
McCormack said , I don 't think that someone will mention Iran 's freedom of the press in connection with the freedom of the press in western Europe and the United States . 
Ahmadinejad once called the Holocaust a myth and urged to wipe Israel off the map , setting off widespread criticism by the United States and other countries . 
McCormack thinks that Hamshahri is funded by the conservative Tehran municipal government . 
It was no coincidence that it should hold this cartoon contest . 
Since Attorney Gao Zhicheng initiated a coordinated 24 - hour hunger strike campaign in ten cities across the country on February 14 , protesting CPC persecution , recently another 170 Shanghai petitioners collectively signed on , expressing their willingness to participate in this human rights hunger strike . 
In addition , they said they will continue to publicize the signatures and number of people in the second group of participants . 
Next , let 's take a look at an interview report by this station . 
According to our understanding , under the government 's intentional manipulation , real estate prices in Shanghai have become among the highest in the world . 
Many government units think of all kinds of ways to forcibly tear down citizens ' residences in high - priced neighborhoods without giving reasonable compensation . 
These ordinary people who have suffered compulsory eviction , thereby losing their homes , have suddenly lost their sources of income . 
Children are unable to pay tuition , and cannot attend school . 
For many years , most people who appealed to higher authorities have been sent to reform - through - labor camps for long periods of time . 
According to statistical data , Shanghai is the region of China with the largest number of people appealing to higher authorities . 
Han Zhongming used to own a storefront , yet it was forcibly torn down . His private residence was also sold by others for profit . 
He was put under house arrest by authorities and was even detained because he appealed to higher authorities . 
Having jumped from a building and slit his wrists , among other forms of protest , he was only recently released . 
Chen Enjuan 's storefront was also forcibly torn down by the government . 
The government hired goons to drag her family of three out of their home and used bulldozers to raze the house together with the furniture . 
She was sent to a reform - through - labor camp for nearly two years because she appealed to higher authorities . 
Speaking about this hunger strike in support of the protest , Chen Enjuan said that besides it was for protesting against government iniquity , 
Attorney Gao has also given us a lot of help and very unselfishly helped us . 
We are safeguarding our rights because we want democracy , ah , because we are thinking of the next generation . 
Our older generation has suffered enough . We also need to make sure that the next generation will not suffer persecution . That is why we want to participate in that human rights campaign . We cannot give up . 
According to the Center on Housing Rights and Evictions , a Geneva - based human rights organization , China has been listed among countries with the most serious housing rights violations in the world . 
This has been an interview report by NTD News correspondent Wang Xin and guest reporter Gu Qing 'er . 
In response to the new round of human rights hunger strike campaign initiated by Attorney Gao Zhicheng , many democracy activists and ordinary citizens in Hong Kong , Taiwan , Calgary , Canada , and the greater Philadelphia area in the United States continued to voice their support in various forms on February 15 . 
The following is a comprehensive report by this station 's correspodnent . 
Based on the 24 - hour coordinated hunger strike campaign in ten provinces and cities across China on February 14 initiated by Attorney Gao Zhicheng to protest CPC tyranny , a signature drive has been launched on the streets of Hong Kong . 
Legislator Leung Kwok - hung , who supports Attorney Gao Zhicheng 's hunger strike campaign , said that CPC authorities recently have made reckless arrests of human rights activists , which is a dangerous signal showing that this government is absolutely not based on popular will . 
The same day happened to be the day for Legislator Attorney Ho Chun - yan , who is preparing to establish a human rights observation team , to have his weekly one - day fast .

On February 17 , the Indian Border Security Force stepped up patrols along the border with Nepal . 
Due to concerns that increasing Maoist rebellions over the past few months may spill across the border , three new battalions have been added to the BSF with the responsibility of guarding the 200 - kilometer - long Indian - Nepalese border in the district of Darjeeling . 
Nepal has the Himalayas in the north . 
It borders India on the other three sides with a border that extends for 1,477 kilometers . 
Maoist rebels often sneak into Indian border villages and acquire weapons from local gangs and drug dealers . 
Sanaya , BSF deputy inspector - general in the Ranidanga area , said that their current 26 battalions will be increased to 36 battalions in order to facilitate patrols of the 100 - kilometer - long border between the districts of Darjeeling and West Sikkim . 
Sanaya noted that according to reports , India 's Kamatapur Liberation Organisation has joined forces with Maoist rebels in the districts of Jhapa and Ilam in eastern Nepal . 
The BFS will set up 18 border observation posts to further strengthen border security . 
BFS patrols will bring along well - trained police dogs to detect explosives and drugs . 
Border officials also began to thoroughly inspect all vehicles and passengers passing through sensitive border checkpoints . 
India is worried that these people may form an alliance with extreme leftists in India . 
Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world . 
The Maoist rebellions have destroyed the entire country 's economy and forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes . 
On Friday , Japan 's cabinet announced the GDP data for the fourth quarter of 2005 . 
After price adjustments , the October - December quarter had a real increase of 1.4 % over the previous quarter , a rate of increase higher than the expected 1.2 % . 
The main factors were strong domestic demand and growth in exports to major countries such as China and the US , indicating signs of sustained economic recovery . 
This is the fourth consecutive quarter that Japan saw economic growth . Furthermore , from the first quarter to the third quarter of 2005 , it was the largest rate of growth . It was mainly helped by the stability of personal expenditures , capital expenditures , and exports . 
In addition , in April Japan 's central bank will end the exceptionally lax currency policy of the past five years , which also backed financial market expectations of economic health . 
Following slight improvements in unemployment and wages , consumer expenditures from October to December rose 0.8 % . 
The Nikkei Index rose after the GDP data was released , but dropped 0.74 % by the end of the morning session . 
The Japanese yen fell after rising temporarily , with the transaction price fluctuating around 118.15 Japanese yen to the US dollar .

Immediately following the IAEA decision to submit the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council for resolution , Iran reiterated that there is no room for it to have any negotiation with the US , one of the sponsors . 
Er , an Iranian government spokesperson said on Monday that the policy toward the US has so far been not to discuss and negotiate over the relations with the other party . 
He said that the West made a huge mistake to submit the nuclear issue to the Security Council , which shows the Western interference in the development of Iran . 
Iran said on Sunday that it will terminate its cooperation with the IAEA . In addition , it will resume uranium enrichment and ban snap inspection of its nuclear facilities . 
Well , Iran 's attitude is now quite firm on this issue , while the US takes an even firmer attitude . 
Er , US Defense Secretary Rumsfeld has frequently reiterated that the use of force will not be ruled out on this issue . 
Well , now rumors said that the US military is indeed carrying out such a plan . 
They are researching and developing a super - sized mother of all bombs . 
Er , once the Defense Department issues the order , they will use this super - sized bomb to blow up Iran . 
Then , how big a bomb is this mother of all bombs ? 
Its weight alone is said to be more than thirty thousand pounds , which is equivalent to that of a two - story bus . Er , in addition , it is also very large in size . 
Well , the main purpose of developing such a super bomb is to blow up some underground facilities in Iran . 
Since it has an extremely powerful penetration , it can penetrate the concrete as well as steel plate , probably causing a large pit of about 60 feet long and half a mile in size . Er , it will destroy many underground construction and facilities . 
Well , it now seems that the United States has really started to sharpen its spear or make bombs at the last minute in this respect . 
Rumsfeld said that no method will be ruled out on this issue , the resolution to the Iran nuclear issue . The method of force has already been put on the agenda . 
In addition , the Iran nuclear issue is continuing to escalate . Well , er , relevant Iranian officials in China said in an interview with this station that actually Iran still insists on cooperating with the international community through peaceful negotiations , er , in hopes of relieving the crisis . 
However , they also said that Iran will adjust the content of its nuclear project cooperation with Russia . 
With regard to the upcoming second round of talks on the uranium enrichment cooperation project between Iran and Russia on February 16 , the Iranian side said that the talks will be carried out as scheduled , but it stressed that the content of talks will be adjusted based on the current developments of the situation . 
Earlier Russia always expressed its support for Iran 's peaceful use of nuclear energy and said it would not refer the Iran nuclear issue to the Security Council . 
However , now we see they have agreed to refer the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council . 
Under this new situation now , we may make some changes regarding our policy agreed upon with Russia earlier . 
Yet , before the UN Security Council makes its final decision in March on whether to adopt economic and political sanctions , Iran maintains that it will continue to negotiate with relevant international institutions . At the same time it is willing to cooperate with the international community to relieve the current crisis . 
We emphasized that Iran will not relinquish its right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy in order to attain its own economic and national development . 
Iran has not violated any relevant international law , and we hope the United States can also understand that . 
The Iran nuclear issue is completely different from the issues of Afghanistan and Iraq . 
I think the US itself is well aware of this point . 
With regard to the so - called military attacks , we have not seen that the US has declared any explicit position . 
We don 't want to see the crisis further escalate . 
We also emphasize on using the method of peaceful negotiations , but we will not yield to pressure . 
In addition ( ( agebi ) ) also expressed hope that China will continue to cooperate with Iran on the basis of its original position .

Let 's first take a look at today 's headlines . 
Northeastern US states and areas along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean were hit this morning by the first blizzard this winter . 
Accumulated snow in some areas exceeded 60 centimeters . 
Several airports were forced to close down . 
More than two thousand flights were cancelled . 
Well , moreover , New York City saw the first such heavy snow in its history . 
Er , this is the second highest snowfall record ever . 
Let 's look at the details . 
On Sunday morning , NYC citizens woke up to find themselves in a white world . 
Outdoors , most of buildings and streets were covered with a thick layer of snow . 
The New York Central Park recorded a snowfall of 57.9 centimeters . 
This is the second highest snowfall record ever in New York City . 
NYC Mayor Bloomberg said that this is a terrible blizzard . 
For the sake of safety , he urged people to stay at home and not to go out . 
Most flights at the three airports in New York City had to be cancelled . 
Some of them will not resume until Monday . 
Heavy snow is also falling over the capital of Washington with accumulated snow exceeding 50 centimeters . 
Lawn and trees were draped in white . 
However , President Bush still went to attend services in church as usual . 
Many citizens also went outdoors to enjoy the beautiful winter scenery and play with snow . 
According to the radar display at the US Weather Service , snow has fallen all over from eastern Virginia to the state of Maine . 
In New Jersey , Long Island of New York , Connecticut , Maryland , and other places , the blizzard was followed by residential and commercial power outage . 
It was estimated that more than 150,000 users were left without power supply . 
Meanwhile , an extensive region in Europe was also affected by blizzards . 
In the southern German state of Bavaria , thousands of firefighters and soldiers were deployed to clear snow on roofs and streets together with police and volunteers . 
The district of Deggendorf in eastern Bavaria remains in a state of emergency after a few days of heavy snow . 
Some small villages have lost contact with the outside world . 
In Bad Reichenhall in the state of Bavaria , a roof collapsed under the weight of accumulated snow last month , leaving 15 people dead . 
This comprehensive report has been brought to you by Phoenix Satellite TV . 
As the blizzard swept across the US northeast region , New York City is naturally one of the cities affected . 
Let 's now connect with Luo Xiaoying , our New York - based correspondent , to find out about the local situation . 
Hello , Xiaoying . 
Hello , Xiaonan . 
Yes . 
With such a heavy snowfall here , how exactly is everything going ? 
I heard that some places did not even have power supply . 
What other places are affected ? 
Yes , that 's right . 
In fact , this blizzard covered quite an extensive area , ah . 
Well , I am happy to tell you that we have now finally seen that the blizzard has stopped . 
In spite of the fierce onset of the blizzard , oh , no serious casualties have been reported . 
Within its scope , several states in the eastern US were affected . For instance , Maryland recorded 21 inches of snow , Pennsylvania , 19 inches , and the areas in New York and New Jersey , over 24 inches . 
Flurries of snow can be seen from Virginia to Maine , or even Tennessee . 
Well , er , as you mentioned just now , um , many places in the Washington area and Baltimore indeed experienced power shortage . 
The % pw total number of households cut from power is probably more than one hundred thousand . 
Well , New York City is fine . The outage , er , power supply in the Manhattan area of New York City is very normal . Only some places in the Long Island area experienced power outage . 
The state of Rhode Island declared a state of emergency . 
Well , roads are open only to emergency vehicles such as snow plowers and ambulances . 
With regard to traffic and transportation , oh , earlier the three major airports in the , um , New York area were all closed . 
However , er , toward evening , we found , for instance , the Newark airport in New Jersey and LaGuardia airport in New York have started to show some signs of resuming airport operations . 
So , some people estimated that these airports may be opened in a few hours . 
For example , Delta Airlines , eh , Delta Airlines , it announced that flights at places like Washington , Philadelphia , Boston , Baltimore , and Connecticut were all cancelled till Monday , oh . 
Now the Reagan airport in the capital of Washington is currently open . 
Well , bus services in New York and New Jersey areas are now stopped . 
% pw trains are also running on reduced schedules . 
Well , right now , we are ... er , it is now Sunday in New York . It is still the Lantern Festival holiday . 
To us Chinese people , originally at the Lantern Festival , there were some Lantern Festival activities in some local Chinese communities , but they all had to be cancelled . 
Well , for New York people , most of their usual Sunday activities were also cancelled . Oh , few people went outdoors , that is , everyone stayed at home . 
Uh - huh . 
What gives people headaches is how they are supposed to go to work on Monday . 
In addition , the clear snow , the accumulated snow may cause some flooding . 
So , the governments in these affected areas in the US are studying how to deal with the rushing crowds of commuters and cars on their way to work on Monday . 
Xiaonan . 
All right . 
Thank you , Xiaonan , for the latest report from the US . 
Since there is no other alternative , we can be relaxed and enjoy this very beautiful snowy scenery . 
Let 's look at a few Japan - related news items . 
Er , Koizumi has always wanted to upgrade Japan 's Defense Agency to a ministry , so as to increase Japan 's military strength . 
However , along the way , this process has aroused a lot of controversy and undergone many twists and turns . 
Recently , some project bid - rigging scandals broke out in the Defense Facilities Administration Agency under Japan 's Defense Agency , causing some current and former officials to be arrested by authorities . 
As a result , quite a few people advised Koizumi to be careful about upgrading the agency to a ministry . 
Well , recently Koizumi said that he would shelve this plan and would not submit it to the Diet for review for the time being . 
Well , he also hopes the two governing parties can carefully discuss this issue and continue , er , consultations . 
On another note , if you go to Japan , there is now a new regulation . 
That is , Japan plans , stipulates that most tourists and travelers to Japan must have their fingerprints scanned and photographs taken . 
This is a way of preventing some dangerous people from entering Japanese territory , and in addition , of guarding against illegal immigrants . 
Er , so , going to Japan should now be even more difficult . 
Well , of course , recently there has also been a piece of good news in Japan . 
That is , Princess Kiko , wife of Japan 's Prince Akishinomiya , is pregnant . 
The event makes many Japanese hopeful that she can give birth to a boy to succeed the throne . 
However , she also brought some disturbance to the otherwise quite peaceful Imperial Household . 
Er , in fact Kiko is now surely quite old for a pregnant woman . Moreover , people have always thought she was satisfied with a four - member family . 
To be pregnant again at such an age , many people cannot help speculating that er , this may be a fight for the throne between brothers of the Imperial Household . 
Of course , this conspiracy theory has been a fascinating topic for many people . 
It is said that this matter may be traced back to several years ago . 
Er , it is like this . When the wife of Crown Prince Naruhito suffered from depression in 2002 , the Imperial Household placed little hope on them and turned to put pressure on Prince Fumihito . 
At that time , Fumihito did not respond much to this . 
But by 2004 , the conflict had become somewhat intense , because Naruhito , eager to protect his wife , criticized the Imperial Household in public . 
Well , it is said that the Imperial Household at that time was furious and asked Prince Fumihito , who is of the same generation , to come out and accuse his elder brother of showing no respect to the Imperial Household while spoiling his own wife . 
The two brothers have not been on good terms since . 
Well , now if a boy is born to Prince Fumihito , then they , as core members , will become a pillar of the Imperial Household . 
Meanwhile , the Eastern Palace , that is , the elder prince , would surely decline as a result . 
Er , so , quite a number of people think that if this is the case , it will have a great impact on the Imperial Household and Japanese society . 
On Monday UN Secretary General Annan went to the White House to meet with US President Bush . 
With regard to Iran 's announcement of its postponement of nuclear talks with Russia , Annan urged Iran to stop nuclear activities as soon as possible and resolve the issue through negotiations instead of confrontation . 
In addition , some sources said that the US Defense Department has actually already started planning for an intensive bombing on Iran as a last resort should diplomatic efforts fail . 
Originally , outsiders think that Bush and Annan would discuss the possibility of the UN Security Council sanctions against Iran , but the two did not publicize any discussion in this regard after their meeting . 
Both Bush and Annan reiterated their hope that the Iran nuclear issue should be resolved through negotiations . 
Annan expressed his concern that Iran started uranium enrichment and decided to postpone nuclear negotiations with Russia . 
On the same day , US media reports said that military tactic experts from the Pentagon have already started planning for an intensive military action so that the US will prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons by military means should diplomatic efforts fail . 
According to the reports , the commander of the US Central Command is making decisions on the targets of attacks . 
There may be a submarine - launched ballistic missile strike or air strikes by B-2 bombers . 
On Monday , Annan called upon all parties involved not to take any action that may escalate the crisis . 
Some military experts analyzed that Iran may acquire the ability to produce nuclear weapons within two years . 
And there are more than two years left from Bush 's second term . 
He will try to resolve the Iran nuclear issue during his term whether by peaceful or military means . 
Mo Naiqian reporting from Washington for Phoenix Satellite TV . 
Iranian President Ahmadinejad said on the 13th that superpowers that threaten other countries with their own weapons will soon disappear . 
At the 27th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution , Ahmadinejad met with diplomatic envoys of various countries in Tehran . 
He said that arms race and competition for hegemony among various countries in the world will achieve nothing . 
The greed of super powers can never be satisfied . They even threaten other countries with their weapons . 
However , he said that these super powers that rely on their weapons to bully other countries will soon disappear . 
The day when mankind enjoys eternal peace and stability will soon come . 
So , we can see this is not merely a battle of words now . In fact , the mounting tensions between Iran and the West are indeed becoming more and more intense . 
Well , since Iran and the US are making no concession to each other in their positions , recently there have also been some format changes . That is , Iran officially announced the day before yesterday that they will resume their uranium enrichment programs . 
In fact , some Western diplomats speculated that they might have actually resumed some procedures for uranium enrichment prior to this . 
In addition , Iran also announced that it would postpone its talks with Russia indefinitely . That is , the talks on Russia refining uranium for Iran . 
Well , of course , the indefinite postponement of the talks was also decided based on this new situation . 
Well , recently , since the US continues to threaten Iran with attacks , the Oxford Research Institute , a UK think tank , issued this report . 
If the US really wants to use force , then half of the people will be dead because of that . In addition , it will of course trigger , um , may keep this year 's wave of violence in the Middle East going on . 
Besides , some terrorist attacks will also escalate . 
Of course , oil prices will also soar , which is also one of the series of Domino effects . 
Furthermore , this report said that if the US fails to subdue Iran , Iran will surely speed up its determination to manufacture nuclear weapons on its own . 
Well , we just mentioned the issue of the Russian - Iranian talks . 
An Iranian government spokesperson indeed said on Monday that due to the new situation , it would postpone its talks with Russian officials scheduled for the 16th on uranium enrichment in Russia . 
However , a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that no official notification from Iran was received yet . 
So , it is still yet too early to tell whether the meeting will be postponed . 
In addition , Russia 's Federal Atomic Energy Agency Director Kuchinov said on Monday that Russia is ready to have talks with Iran on the conditions and principle of the negotiations over the nuclear issue . 
At the same time , the US New York Times recently published an editorial . 
The title of this editorial is also very conspicuous . It is called Japan 's Offensive Foreign Minister . 
Well , this editorial specifically mentioned that Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso recently made a string of appalling remarks . 
These remarks were all very dishonest and very unwise . Furthermore , the remarks have triggered widespread indignation among Asian countries . 
Well , this editorial also specifically mentioned that Japan should acknowledge its mistakes and learn the lesson rather than avoid mentioning in post - WW II textbooks some of their deeds during the war as they are doing right now . 
At the same time , the editorial also said that many of Taro Aso 's current remarks , for instance , requesting the prime minister to visit Yasukuni Shrine , for instance , saying Taiwanese colonial rule raised , um , ah , the Japanese colonial rule raised Taiwan 's educational level , and so on , it said such remarks were all very appalling . Moreover , it is evident that he has no knowledge of history and is a very poor diplomat too . 
Since the New York Times was the third largest newspaper in circulation in the United States last year , it should be very influential in the US society . 
As a result , such an editorial should also be very influential . 
In the meantime , some former senior US government officials and some US experts on Asian issues , they recently held a special forum , that is , a forum on Sino - Japanese relations . 
Well , at this forum , some experts put forward this viewpoint . 
It said that as current Sino - Japanese relations are under great tensions , there may be potential danger of military conflict . 
Furthermore , it even said that now there is a greater possibility of a military conflict breaking out between China and Japan than between China and Taiwan . 
Er , moreover , once the military conflict breaks out , it will surely drag the US into it because the US will surely get involved . 
Well , a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson also participating in the forum said that Sino - Japanese relations are now indeed under great tensions . 
So , any mistake will lead to serious consequences . 
On another note , the Georgian parliament 's Defense and Security Committee held an expanded meeting and decided to expel the Russian peacekeeping force from South Ossetia . 
The Russian parliament will hold a general assembly to review this bill today . 
Er , experts think that if the parliament agrees to expel the Russian peacekeeping force , it may lead to the complete breakup of Georgian - Russian ties . 
A spokesperson for the Russian peacekeeping force said on the 14th that two of the Russian peacekeeping contingent 's military vehicles transporting foods were intercepted by Georgian police with the driver expelled . 
Er , the spokesperson called for Georgia to stop immediately such provocations ; otherwise Russia would assume no responsibility for the consequences of the incident . 
Two military vehicles belonging to the logistic system of the Russian peacekeeping contingent transporting foods and groceries were examined by Georgian police Monday night in Georgia 's South Ossetia . 
Georgian law enforcement personnel on duty expelled the Russian driver and escorting personnel and forcibly drove away the two military vehicles . 
The incident greatly angered the Russian peacekeeping force . 
A spokesperson for the Russian peacekeeping force said that on February 1 , Georgian police detained a Russian military vehicle in the area on an excuse of a traffic accident and has not returned it so far . 
On February 8 , three Russian military officers were detained for two days and nights on grounds of visa problems . 
Georgia 's reckless provocations were aimed to incur bloodshed in the area by forcing the Russian troops to open fire so that it could achieve the goal of the withdrawal of the peacekeeping force from South Ossetia . 
On that day , the Russian embassy in Georgia made serious representations to the Georgian side , demanding Georgia to immediately stop frenzied provocations ; otherwise the Russian side will not assume any consequence of the resulting conflict . 
The media noted that on February 13 , Georgian Defense Minister Okruashvili announced that the head of the Russian military base in Akhalkalaki sold several Strela portable air defense missile systems to South Ossetia . 
On that day , the Georgian parliament Defense and Security Committee held an expanded meeting to hear a report by the law enforcement agency . It decided to expel the Russian peacekeeping troops in Georgia and called for a review of this issue at the general assembly on the 14th . 
Experts think that the final decision , once passed , may eventually lead to the complete breakup of Georgian - Russian ties . 
Earlier , Georgian Foreign Minister Bezhuashvili vehemently criticized the Russian position and refuted Russian President Putin 's remark that Russia may recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia should the West recognize Kosovo . He thinks that Russian authorities are sending an encouraging signal to all secessionist districts . 
The Russian Foreign Ministry also announced earlier that it would protect Russian citizens in South Ossetia , implying a direct threat of military force to Georgia . 
Lu Yuguang reporting from Moscow for Phoenix Satellite TV . 
US Pacific Fleet Commander Roughead announced on Tuesday that this summer the United States will deploy four aircraft carriers to conduct the largest - ever military exercise in the Asia - Pacific region in ten years . 
Roughead also said that the United States will , er , not consider , um , China , ah , a threat . 
The US military is hoping to have another joint exercise with China 's PLA Navy . 
This declaration of position immediately drew the attention of US defense experts . 
Heritage Foundation , a US think tank , held a forum on the Pentagon defense review report on Wednesday . 
The subtle relationship between the defense report and the military exercise has become one of the focuses of discussion . 
Some , however , think that Roughead 's open invitation of China to participate in the military exercise was a sign of US friendship to China . 
Since the US military also expressed hope for more transparency in China 's PLA operations while inviting China to participate in the military exercise , some defense experts think that this shows the Pentagon 's hope to sound each other out through the joint military exercise because it is not sure about the purpose of China 's military expansion . 
In addition , since the defense review report released by the Pentagon at the beginning of this month considered China the greatest potential threat , the two defense experts also pointed out that the Asia - Pacific military exercise is the first step that the US Department of Defense takes to adjust its strategy on this basis . 
Xie Xiaoshuang reporting from Washington for Phoenix Satellite TV . 
In addition , this time , this US military exercise in summer is drawing quite a lot of attention , because this is also , ah , the first time in a decade that the US has four aircraft carriers , ah , to participate jointly in a military exercise . It is also the first time after the Vietnam War that the US deployed the aircraft carriers off the East Coast to do such a military exercise in this west Pacific Ocean region . 
Well , this military exercise , ah , is actually very frequent , taking place four times in a few months . 
Er , these also include a multinational military exercise . 
Well , this multinational military exercise , ah , includes Japan , ah , South Korea , and Australia .

Er , the statement said that there will be a thorough investigation into the incident and that Pakistan will strengthen security protection of all Chinese working in this country . In addition , it said that Pakistan will try all it can to prevent similar incidents from reoccurring . 
Er , in addition , according to the report by Pakistan 's private - run GEO on the evening of the 15th , Bashir , chief executive officer of the Attock cement factory in Pakistan , said in his interview with the station this evening that following the attack , the Pakistani side will try to arrange for the remaining 11 Chinese engineering and technical personnel working on the construction site of the cement project to return to their country as soon as possible . 
Well , um , Bashir also said in the interview that with regard to the question of some Pakistani media why the Chinese engineers did not have security guards with them when the incident took place , er , he said , er , actually the cement factory where these engineers worked has its own security system ; however , since the incident occurred within the boundary of the factory , none of security guards were with them at the time . 
Well , he expressed deep regrets about the occurrence of this tragic incident . 
Host . 
Eh , all right . 
Er , besides , it is actually not the first time that Chinese engineering personnel were killed in attacks in Pakistan . 
Such an incident occurred in October 2004 . 
Two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by an armed group in South Waziristan . 
In the end , one of them unfortunately died during the rescue mission . 
In addition , three engineering personnel also died in a bombing attack in Gwadar in May of the same year . 
Let 's have a recap . 
On May 3, 2004 , in the port of Gwadar in the southern part of the province of Balochistan , Pakistan , a vehicle carrying 12 Chinese was hit by a car bomb while it was driving to the port construction site . 
In the end three Chinese engineering personnel died , while nine people were wounded . 
This attack was believed to be launched by local separatists and tribal militias . 
On October 9 of the same year , two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by gunmen in South Waziristan where Pakistan borders Afghanistan . 
When Pakistani troops came to the rescue of the hostages later , one engineer was unfortunately shot to death . 
However , armed groups linked with al - Qaeda rather than separatist militants were believed to be responsible for this hostage incident . 
Since China has a close economic exchange with Pakistan and participates in Pakistan 's infrastructure construction , quite a number of Chinese engineering personnel are working there . 
Yet , tribal militias in Pakistan accused the government of robbing them of their natural resources . 
Consequently , Chinese people have fallen victims several times to attacks and abductions .

Let 's look at a few Japan - related news items . 
Recently there has been a rather shocking piece of news in Japanese political circles . 
That is , Tsuneo Watanabe , chairman of the Yomiuri Shimbun , the number one in the Japanese media , he ordered the Yomiuri Shimbun to publish some articles against Koizumi 's visit to Yasukuni Shrine . Furthermore , the Yomiuri Shimbun has since taken a position against Koizumi 's visit to Yasukuni Shrine . 
Er , well , um , Tsuneo Watanabe , he was lashing out against Koizumi in his speech a few days ago , saying he is very ignorant and has no knowledge of any history or culture . 
At the same time he also said that visiting Yasukuni Shrine is like singing praises of Hitler . In addition , he said that by doing so , Koizumi also made China and South Korea consider Japan a very dangerous country . This is going to have no end of trouble . 
Well , why could Tsuneo Watanabe , his attitude trigger great impact ? 
Actually , he is also very influential in political circles and has been a manipulator behind the scenes all along . 
Yet , he used to be a very rightist figure . 
We should say he had always supported hawks and also pushed vigorously for constitutional amendment . 
But now , ah , this is really a big turn . 
He now directed his attacks against Koizumi and started to oppose such a stance . 
Actually in 2004 when someone attacked Koizumi for visiting Yasukuni Shrine , um , Tsuneo Watanabe , he still said , he said , er , he supported him and wanted Koizumi to resist the pressure . 
However , he gave a speech recently . He said , I am already more than 80 years old and don 't have much time left . 
Well , he has now adopted a high - sounding tone and taken on a kind of highly anti - war stance in his speech . 
This kind of changing sides by him , of course , has a great social impact in Japan . 
Just like Tsuneo Watanabe said himself , he said , I firmly believe I have the actual power of controlling and changing the political orientation . 
Furthermore , he also said that should the Yomiuri Shimbun 's freedom of speech and freedom of coverage and compilation be under the government pressure , he would resist it at the risk of his life . 
Well , what kind of situation has it come to now ? 
That is , the Yomiuri Shimbun , the largest newspaper in Japan , and the Asahi Shimbun , the second largest newspaper in Japan , now these two large newspapers have started to join hands in opposing Koizumi 's visit to Yasukuni Shrine . 
Originally , these two large newspapers were opponents , but later when the two chairmen met , they at least reached consensus on this issue . 
As a result , they now both launched massive attacks on Koizumi , forming what we could call a dream team . 
Actually , these two large newspapers of theirs should have a very large influence on Japanese mainstream public opinion . 
In addition , let 's look at the meeting of Japan 's House of Representatives . At one of their recent meetings , two relatively popular candidates for successor to Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi made the same remark . 
Who are these two people ? 
One is Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe , and the other is Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso , who has made a series of appalling remarks recently . 
What remarks did these two make ? 
They said that Japan 's WWII criminals were not criminals . 
What they meant was , er , it was the international court that has called them criminals and convicted them . 
Whereas , in Japan , according to the international law , they were ; according to the domestic law in Japan , er , the war criminals did not violate the domestic law of Japan . 
Therefore , they think that WWII criminals should not be considered criminals in Japan . 
At the same time , um , Shinzo Abe , he also mentioned that Japan should now focus its vision on the whole world and develop relations with the United States and develop commercial and trade relations with , um , some east Asian countries . In addition , it should also try its best to develop close ties with India . It should not always focus on China . 
China 's New Management Rules for E - banking Operations to Take Effect on March 1 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , Feb. 6 ( Correspondents Han Jie and Xu Bo ) On the 6th , reporters learned from the China Banking Regulatory Commission that the Measures for Administration of E - banking Business and the Security Evaluation Guidance on E - banking issued recently by the CBRC will take effect on March 1, 2006 . 
A CBRC spokesperson said that according to the rules of the Measures for Administration , relevant approval methods for foreign financial institutions basically remain unchanged , that is , after a foreign bank branch is approved to initiate e - banking operations , if new types of e - banking operations need to be added , the main reporting office in China for such bank branch should submit a uniform application for review and approval . 
In order to standardize e - banking operations of commercial banks , the People 's Bank of China promulgated the Interim Measures for Administration of E - banking Business in June 2001 . 
The CBRC spokesperson said that with the continuous development of commercial bank e - banking operations , the Interim Measures can no longer meet the requirements of e - banking risk supervision . Therefore , the CBRC formulated these two new rules . 
According to the introduction by the CBRC spokesperson , CBRC accreditation of security evaluation institutions is different from administrative approvals concerning the entrance eligibility of industries or enterprises . It is not a necessary condition for evaluation institutions to carry out e - banking security evaluation business , but rather serves as a reference for financial institutions for selecting evaluation institutions . 
As long as a security evaluation institution meets the relevant conditions and requirements , even if it does not have CBRC accreditation , financial institutions can still hire it to conduct e - banking security evaluation , though management shall be carried out in accordance with relevant regulations . 
The Measures for Administration of E - banking Business include 99 articles under nine chapters , with the nine sections covering general provisions , applications and amendments , risk management , administration of data exchange and transfer , outsourcing business , administration of transnational business , supervision and management , legal obligations , and by - laws . 
The Security Evaluation Guidance on E - banking includes 57 articles under five chapters , with the five sections covering general provisions , security evaluation institutions , implementation of security evaluations , administration of security evaluation activities , and by - laws .

( Overseas , China - related ) Third Chinese Compatriot Robbed and Killed in South Africa in Two Days 
Xinhua News Agency , Johannesburg , Feb. 6 ( Correspondent Chen Ming ) On the early morning of the 5th local time , Lin Yixing , an overseas Chinese compatriot from Fuqing , Fujian Province of China , was wounded after being robbed by local armed elements in the pub he operated and died on the early morning of the 6th after emergency treatment failed in a hospital in South African legislative capital of Bloemfontein . 
According to Feng Yang , director of the Chinese Association in Free State Province , the incident took place in a pub in the city of Welkom , more than 130 kilometers northwest of Bloemfontein . 
At the time , the pub owner Lin Yixing was cleaning up things and getting ready to close the pub for the day . 
There were still three patrons in the pub at that time . One of the patrons took out a pistol and rushed into the pub counter for robbery . 
Lin Yixing , who was in his 40s , fought with the culprit , who fired a shot at Lin Yixing before fleeing . 
Locals who rushed to the scene upon hearing the news sent Lin Yixing to hospital for treatment . As his body began to show general diffuse capillary hemorrhage , Lin Yixing suffered continuous bleeding and died at about 3:30 a.m. on February 6 . 
On February 6 , Consuls Xu Defu and Wu Gang from the Chinese consulate general in Johannesburg as well as Lin Changming , deputy director of the China Fujian Association in South Africa , along with others , drove to Bloemfontein to assist the family members of the deceased in dealing with the aftermath . 
Lin Yixing became the third Chinese shot and killed by robbers within 36 hours and was also the fourth Chinese killed in South Africa this year . 
( Selected Excerpts from Newspapers and Magazines ) Shanghai : Moonlighters and College Graduates Become Main Hourly Workforce 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , Feb. 7 The Shanghai Labor and Social Security Bureau released the latest 2006 wage guidelines for hourly workers on the 6th . The number of job positions reached 120 , 11 more than the previous time , while the prevailing wages in previous existing positions had increases and decreases . 
According to estimates by relevant experts at the Shanghai Labor and Social Security Bureau , currently the number of hourly workers in Shanghai has exceeded 1 million . 
According to a China Youth Daily report , the hourly workforce is mainly composed of college graduates and moonlighters . 
A direct survey of nearly 8,000 hourly workers found more than half of them are moonlighters , accounting for 51.1 % . 
In general , moonlighters have relatively higher levels of education and are mainly engaged in more technically focused work . For instance , among translation - related jobs , the percentage of moonlighters has reached 81.7 % , while it has reached 61.6 % for people in fitness professions . 
High wages are one of the major reasons for many people to get second jobs as hourly workers . 
It was learned that some specific positions such as simultaneous interpreters can earn monthly incomes of tens of thousands of yuan and are also in high demand . Most hourly workers such as freelance accountants or masters of ceremony at weddings can make more than 2,000 yuan a month . 
Satisfying personal interests and expanding knowledge are also major reasons why hourly work appeals to people . 
For example , Mr. Gu , a human resources manager in a company , spends a few hours each week doing accounting for the representative office of a foreign company . 
Mr. Gu thinks the greatest benefit of the second job is that it allows him to continuously update his knowledge and to have the chance to get involved in another field . Of course , the monthly income of 2,000 yuan certainly has some appeal as well . 
As some hourly positions have low minimum requirements and work styles which are flexible and independent , they are gradually gaining favor among many graduates looking for jobs . Some 14 % of hourly workers are college or technical school graduates from within the past three years . 
" At first I didn 't want to be an hourly worker . Yet after working for a few months , I feel it is better than working from 9 to 5 . " 
Xiao Huang , whose job after college was not satisfying , eventually signed up with a hotel to play background music on the piano . 
" I am quite satisfied with my current job . It pays 100 yuan per hour and has a nice environment too . What I need to do now is find a few more hourly positions . " 
It was learned that working at hourly positions has become an important approach for some job - seeking graduates to accumulate work experience , practice work skills , enhance communication skills , and increase exposure to society . 
Hourly jobs taken by graduates are mainly concentrated in knowledge - based and more technically focused positions . For instance , specialty focused jobs like those related to translation and trendy entertainment account for 22.1 % and 26.8 % , respectively . 
Some hourly jobs require few skills , such as food salespeople and inventory workers . Laid - off workers can start work right after minimal training . 
Statistics show that among hourly workers , 39 % were previously laid - off workers . Among them , the unemployed working in the retail sector has reached 68.4 % , while the percentage in the catering sector has reached 58.7 % . Hourly jobs have become a major channel for the jobless to get reemployed .

Chinese Experts : US Playing up " China Military Threat " is Groundless Accusation 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , Feb. 9 ( Correspondents Li Xuanliang , Xiong Zhengyan , and Lin Liping ) In the Quadrennial Defense Review that the US Pentagon has officially submitted to Congress recently , China was for the first time called " an emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the United States . " 
Experts think this is a groundless accusation against China 's normal national defense construction . It plays up " China military threat " and interferes in China 's internal affairs . 
The Quadrennial Defense Review is the Pentagon 's new national defense guideline document . 
The 92 - page - long report devoted three paragraphs to commenting on China 's military issues and the countermeasures the United States should take . Directly mentioning the two phrases of " China " or " Chinese " 15 times , the report said that " as a major and emerging power , China has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States . If the United States does not have countermeasures , China will very likely develop disruptive military technologies so as to destroy US a 
Yao Yunzhu , a research fellow from the department of world military studies of the Chinese Military Academy of Sciences , said that though senior US officials expressed similar views on various occasions earlier , this is the first time the United States proposed in its " national defense strategy report " that " China is an emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the United States . " 
" The report for the first time explicitly refers to Russia , India and China as emerging strategic rivals ; in particular , more attention was given to the so - called ' China military threat , ' " 
said Major General Peng Guangqian , a research fellow with the Chinese Military Academy of Sciences . 
Noticeably , on the same day the Quadrennial Defense Review was officially submitted , US President Bush also submitted a government budget for the 2007 fiscal year to Congress , with the national defense budget at 439.3 billion US dollars . 
" If the additional budget for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan is added , the US national defense budget for 2007 fiscal year will go beyond the milestone of 500 billion dollars , an all time high , " Peng Guangqian said . " That is almost equal to the sum of the military spending of all the other countries in the world . " 
Peng Guanqian thinks that the fabrication of " foreign threats " by the United States reflected the Pentagon 's habitual style of " making enemies " and that its real purpose is to secure more national defense funds so that the huge US arms industry groups can fish for more profits . 
Experts said that compared with huge military expenditures of the United States , China 's national defense expenditures are quite limited . 
Deng Hongzhou , a military expert who has participated several times in drafting the white papers on China 's national defense , said that China 's defense expenditures have somewhat increased with economic development since the 1990s , but the proportion it takes in the State national budget for the same period is on the decline . 
Official statistics show that compared with 1979 , the proportion of China 's expenditures for national defense in 2004 in the State budget for the same period dropped by nearly 10 percentage points . 
In 2005 China 's expenditures for national defense was 244.656 billion RMB , only about 1/14 of that of the United States . Its military expenditure per capita was about 1/60 of that of the United States , and its military funding per soldier was about 1/30 of that of a US soldier . 
" The United States is equal to China in terms of territorial area , but there is such a big difference in military expenditures . It is self - evident whose military power is beyond normal defense needs . " 
Peng Guangqian said . 
Teng Jianqun , director of the research department of the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association , said that the United States should evaluate China 's military construction situation objectively and that China 's peaceful development doesn 't necessarily mean that China and the United States will become military antagonists in the future . 
China 's 2004 white paper on national defense says that China firmly adheres to the path of peaceful development and adopts a national defense policy that is defensive in nature . 
China has never threatened any country in the past and at present , and will never do so in the future . 
So far China has not set up any military base in any other country , nor has China dispatched a single soldier to other countries . In contrast , the United States has established more than 100 military bases overseas and has deployed more than 100,000 soldiers in Asia alone . 
Zhu Feng , a professor of the International Relations Institute of Peking University , said that China and the United States should increase communication and exchange through established channels and enhance understanding and mutual trust so as to fully push forward the China - US constructive cooperation in the new century and jointly promote and safeguard world peace and development .

Xinhua News Agency , Turin , Feb. 9 ( Correspondents Ding Ying and Yan Tao ) The opening ceremony of the 20th Winter Olympics will officially kick off at the Stadio Olimpico in Turin at 8:00 p.m. local time on the 10th . 
On the 9th , Turin 's Organizing Committee for the Winter Olympic Games revealed in advance to reporters the exciting opening ceremony arrangements . 
TOROC President Castellani was full of confidence regarding the opening ceremony . He said at the press conference that this opening ceremony has cost a total of almost 10 million euros and gathered top talents from various sectors across Italy . 
He said the evening of the 10th will be unforgettable , as 35,000 spectators at the stadium along with some 2 billion TV viewers all over the world " will witness a passionate and successful opening ceremony . " 
Passionate flames , fervent red hearts , the brilliant five rings , peaceful doves , the white snow of the Alps , and dairy cows will all appear at the opening ceremony . The director introduced : " passion , dynamism , and Italian flair will be the themes of the opening ceremony . " As the largest Winter Olympics in history , it will showcase time - honored and rich Italian history and culture , an energetic humanist style , and the spirit of peace advocated by the Olympic Games . 
Famous Italian designer Armani specially designed costumes for the opening ceremony , while famous Italian fashion brand Moschino will provide formal attire for the guides leading the athletes ' ceremonial entrance . 
However , regarding whether Pavarotti , the famous Italian tenor , will sing a song at the opening ceremony , TOROC will leave the suspense until the end . 
Eight " hockey players " with fire erupting from their heads will demonstrate their burning passion with a flame of more than three meters in length as they shuttle back and forth on the rink at a speed of 70 kilometers .

Bush also said that at the invitation of the Pakistani and Indian governments , he would visit Pakistan and India in March . 
( International Observation ) Hamas Seeks Breakthrough in Forming Cabinet 
Xinhua News Agency , Ram Allah , Feb. 9 ( International Observation ) Hamas Seeks Breakthrough in Forming Cabinet 
Xinhua News Agency Correspondents Wang Hao and Huang Min 
After the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) won the Legislative Council elections , how to draw up a blueprint for a new government has become the current focus of international attention . 
What new policies Hamas will push for will directly impact the direction of subsequent corresponding policies by the various parties to the peace process . 
In the meantime , resistance by the US and Israel will add to the uncertainty about the prospects of the Hamas government . 
At present , various parties in Palestine are accelerating consultations and actively seeking breakthroughs on difficulties and sensitive points regarding future developments involved in forming the cabinet . 
( Subtitle ) Who Will Become Prime Minister ? 
After Hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet , some outsiders worried that disagreements could occur between " Prime Minister Hamas " and current top leader Abbas . 
In addition , Hamas leader Mashal , who is currently visiting Egypt , stressed that the new Palestinian government led and formed by Hamas will not recognize Israel . This strong message also increased international concern . 
The US and Israel explicitly said that they would not accept a Hamas government which possesses actual power , threatening to discontinue economic aid and tax transfers to Palestine . 
However , this did not hinder Hamas from making a flexible tactical adjustment , selecting an independent individual as a compromise . 
According to reports , in order to obtain maximum international recognition , Hamas leaders both at home and abroad , who recently gathered in Egypt , decided to select independent Jamal al - Khudairi , board chairman of the Islamic University in Gaza , as new prime minister . 
The move has yet to receive responses from relevant parties . 
Palestinian analyst Hussein said that no matter who becomes prime minister , the key is that the prime minister nominee should try to downplay the hard - line stance of Hamas . Only in this way can success in forming a cabinet be ensured . 
( Subtitle ) How to Divide Power ? 
Internally , the biggest challenge Hamas faces in forming a cabinet is its lack of sufficient experience in governance . 
An article carried in the Palestinian newspaper Al - Ayyam analyzed that although Hamas won popularity through its social welfare programs , it lacks experience in governance . It would be wise for it to cooperate with the Palestinian National Liberation Movement ( Fatah ) , which has experience in governance . 
Following the elections , Hamas proposed establishing a " political partnership " with Fatah so as to jointly form a national coalition government . However , Fatah has not responded enthusiastically so far . 
Fatah is currently divided internally with regards to joining the cabinet . One faction advocates joining the new government so as to make some kind of move , while another faction rejects the Hamas invitation , preferring to be an " active opposition " in the Legislative Council . 
Sources noted that under Abbas 's persuasion , Fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government . 
In spite of this , Hamas and Fatah will still bargain over the distribution of cabinet positions . 
In addition , another approach is to form a cabinet outside the framework of the Legislative Council , breaking away from partisan affiliations . 
According to reports , Hamas has designed a government exclusively composed of experts , but the specific name list is unknown . 
Based on US and Israeli attitudes , forming a government composed of technical experts would also be a good way to relieve outside pressure . 
According to the provisions of the Palestinian Basic Law , after the new Legislative Council assumes power on the 16th of this month , the nomination of the prime minister and formation of the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks . 
( Subtitle ) What About Arms ? 
The weapons it possesses is another tough issue Hamas faces in forming the new government . 
The US and Israel are very firm in their positions , resolutely demanding that Hamas abandon violence and rejecting its armed participation in the government . 
Hamas leader Mashal stressed on the 9th that armed resistance is a " strategic choice " of the organization . 
The issue of weapons actually exists on two levels , the legitimacy of arms and the affiliation and administration of armed forces . 
Hamas won international recognition by being elected the top major party in the Legislative Council through democratic and free methods . The way to similarly legalize its subordinate armed faction Az A - Din Al - Qassam Brigades is to integrate it into government security institutions . 
Hamas had previously proposed unifying armed forces of all factions into a " People 's Army " of the Palestinian National Authority , yet failed to get widespread response and was criticized by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad ( Jihad ) . 
At present , Palestine has more than 60,000 security agency personnel , most of whom come from the Fatah camp . 
In addition , Fatah has some loosely organized subordinate armed factions , such as al - Aqsa Martyrs ' Brigades and the Fatah Hawks . 
Hamas , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must reach a consensus with Abbas as to how to manage these autonomous armed forces and reasonably divide administrative power . 
According to local media reports , Abbas intends to be in charge of security and intelligence forces , while leaving agencies such as the police and civil defense under the administration of the Interior Ministry of the new government . 
However , the various parties are still negotiating over this sensitive issue , with no outcome so far . 
China Releases Report on Polar Exploration for First Time 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , Feb. 10 ( Correspondent Li Jianmin ) The State Oceanic Administration has recently released the 2005 Annual Report on China 's Polar Exploration . This is the first time such reports have ever been released since China began its scientific polar expedition activities more than 20 years ago . 
The Report gives a comprehensive account of China 's polar exploration activities , polar logistics assurance , and major progresses and achievements made in polar scientific research in 2005 . 
According to the records of the Report , at 22:15 on January 9, 2005 ( Beijing time ) , the Chinese Antarctic Inland Icecap Expedition team successfully reached Dome A area , the highest elevation of the Antarctic Inland Icecap , and at 3:15 on January . 18 , 2005 ( Beijing time ) confirmed the highest elevation point of Dome A was 4,093 meters . 
" On the stage of increasingly competitive international polar expedition , the Chinese , relying on their strong willpower and fearless spirit , were courageous to open up new fields and took the lead to challenge the 'peak of the Antarctic Icecap . ' Their single - stroke success realized another dream of human beings in Antarctica . " 
SOA Director Sun Zhihui said . 
The Report shows that on March 24, 2005 , China 's 21st Antarctic expedition team successfully finished its mission and returned to Shanghai . The expedition lasted 151 days on a journey of 26,500 nautical miles . 
On November 18 of the same year , China 's 22nd Antarctic expedition team left Shanghai for the Zhongshan Station in Antarctica to carry out scientific exploration , and it will leave the Zhongshan Station for Shanghai by way of Australia before the end of February 2006 . 
Since it was the first report on polar exploration China released , the 2005 Annual Report on China 's Polar Exploration also reviewed and summarized China 's polar exploration that started in the early 1980s . 
According to the Report , in 1983 , China officially joined the Antarctic Treaty and became a member country of the organization . In addition , China successively became a member country of a few most influential international organizations on Antarctic affairs , including the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting , the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research , and the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs . 
In 1997 , China became a member of the International Arctic Science Committee and won a say in and the right to making decisions in international polar affairs . 
The Report noted that after more than 20 years , China 's polar exploration " has taken shape out of nothing and continued to grow in scale , " forming a " three stations , one vessel " system on Antarctica and Arctic exploration , namely , the Changcheng Station in the Antarctic established in February 1985 and the Zhongshan Station in the Antarctic established in February 1989 , and the Huanghe Station built in July 2004 in the Arctic , as well as the " Xuelong " polar scientific research ves 
The statistics in the Report show that by the end of 2005 , China had organized 22 Antarctic expeditions , two Arctic expeditions based on the " Xuelong " vessel , and another two Arctic expeditions at the Huanghe Station . To date , more than 3,000 scientific visits have been made by Chinese people nationwide to the Antarctica and Arctic for up close and on - site exploration . 
" We are now carrying out feasibility study of setting up the third Antarctica scientific station and also China 's first inland station at the Antarctic . " 
Sun Zhihui said . 
" After more than 20 years ' endeavors , China has got a niche in polar exploration in the world . However , compared with other major polar exploration countries , there is still a relatively large gap . We must catch up with them . " 
He said . 
Sun Zhihui disclosed that China will issue a report on polar exploration every year starting this year .

( Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan ) IPO for Subsidiary 3 Italia Deferred , Hutchison Whampoa Announces 
Xinhua News Agency , Hong Kong , Feb. 11 Hutchison Whampoa Co . , Ltd announced on the 11th that it will defer the planned IPO of " 3 Italia , " its subsidiary 3G telecommunications company . 
Fok Kin - ning , Hutchison 's Group managing director , said that although " 3 Italia " has now received all relevant regulatory approvals required to list , it would be in too much a hurry because the procedures for share subscription must be completed in the next few weeks . 
At the same time , as current market conditions for European telecom stocks are weak , the market would not necessarily give " 3 Italia " an appropriate IPO evaluation at this time . 
Considering the best interests of shareholders , it has been decided that the IPO be deferred . 
As to when share subscription will start again for the IPO , Fok Kin - ning said it would depend on the future conditions of the European telecommunications market . 
He thinks that between now and the IPO , " 3 Italia " needs to conduct a broad investor education campaign so that the global telecommunications investors will understand more clearly 3 Italia 's current robust performance and its promising future . 
According to some other media report , Goldman Sachs , an investment bank acting as one of the global coordinators for " 3 Italia , " has agreed to hold 10 % of " 3 Italia " equities in the form of private subscription for 420 million euros . The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of March this year . 
( Overseas , China - related ) China - Myanmar Economic and Trade Relations Show Positive Momentum of Development and Promise Tremendous Potential 
Xinhua News Agency , Yongon , Feb. 12 ( Correspondent Zhang Yunfei ) In a special interview with reporters of this agency on the eve of Myanmar Prime Minister Soe Win 's visit to China on the 14th , Chinese Ambassador to Myanmar Guan Mu and Commercial Attache Tang Hai said that at present China - Myanmar economic and trade Relations have showed positive momentum of common development featuring rich content , a great variety of forms , and mutual benefit . 
Ambassador Guan Mu said that in recent years the neighborly and friendly ties between China and Myanmar , built on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , have been solidified and developed . Exchange and cooperation in various fields are increasingly expanding and deepening while bilateral economic and trade relations continue to be promoted and strengthened . 
Attache Tang Hai said that continued reciprocal visits at high level of the two countries have vigorously promoted the development of the bilateral economic and trade cooperation . 
During the bilateral high - level reciprocal visits in 2004 , the two sides signed 33 economic and trade cooperation agreement documents . Most of them are now being implemented and carried out . 
He said that it was 1.14 billion US dollars in 2004 and reached 1.209 billion US dollars in 2005 . Of the total , China 's exports were 935 million US dollars , while its imports stood at 274 million US dollars . 
Of last year 's bilateral trade , the total trade volume ( including the border trade ) between China 's Yunnan and Myanmar amounted to 630 million US dollars , up 14.6 % over the previous year . 
Tang Hai said that Myanmar has become one of the major markets for Chinese companies to carry out engineering contract projects . The main projects China has been contracted to do in Myanmar include power stations , bridges , harbors , and factories ( such as sugar plants , textile plants , cement plants , and paper pulp plants ) , etc. 
As Chinese companies carry out their engineering projects in Myanmar , they have also stimulated the export of various sets of mechanical and electronics products by China . Myanmar has become one of the major markets for China 's equipment sets , and mechanical and electronics products . 
According to the statistics by China 's Customs , in the recent five or six years , the export volume of mechanical and electronics products has accounted for some 45 % of China 's total exports to Myanmar .

World Bank Plans Debt Relief for Poorest Countries 
Xinhua News Agency , Moscow , Feb. 11 World Bank President Wolfowitz said in Moscow on the 11th that the World Bank will completely write off debts owed by the poorest countries by the middle of this year . 
This day Wolfowitz held talks in Moscow with finance ministers of various countries who have come to attend the G8 Ministers of Finance meeting . 
He said in a statement issued after the meeting that the World Bank will implement the debt relief plan before July 1 this year , for which the World Bank is completing all the technical work . 
Last year , the World Bank donor nations completely wrote off debts owed by 28 countries and pledged to replenish the relevant trust funds . 
The IMF , which is a relatively small creditor , started to forgive debts at the end of 2005 . 
In addition , Wolfowitz welcomed Russia 's decision to write off debts of 16 African countries . 
High - definition Digital TV Becoming Mainstream in America 
Xinhua News Agency , New York , Feb. 12 ( Correspondent Fan Xiaolin ) As high - definition digital television (HDTV) prices continually fall and markets expand , US television broadcasters are also increasing their output of HDTV programs . 
The recently concluded " Super Bowl " American football game has warmed up the US broadcasting business to welcome the age of HDTV . 
According to a Financial Times report the other day , the US Congress recently passed a bill requiring that American broadcasters must discontinue all current analog TV signal broadcasting and only broadcast digital TV signals by February 17, 2009 . 
This means that the full digitization of US television programs now has a clear timetable . 
In order for HDTV to become widespread , it must on one hand depend on consumers to purchase TV sets , and on the other depend on the content industry to supply high - definition digital programs . 
Although digital TV has been brought up repeatedly in the past few years , it has still not become reality . 
The issue has taken a new turn this year . 
According to the US Consumer Electronics Association , this year digital TV sales in the US passed that of conventional TV for the first time , and 85 % of the digital TVs were high - definition products . 
Japanese Researchers Develop New Type of High - efficiency Artificial Kidney 
Xinhua News Agency , Tokyo , Feb. 13 ( Correspondent Qian Zheng ) Researchers at Japan 's Tokai University have developed a type of bio - artificial kidney , which not only has the same catabolic functions as a human kidney , but also the function of preserving useful substances . In addition it is small in size and easy to transplant . With further research , there is hope it will bring good news to kidney patients . 
According to a recent Nikkei Business Daily report , the newly - developed bio - artificial kidney mainly consists of two parts , an artificial nephron that filters metabolic waste and water from the blood and an artificial renal tubule that returns to the blood the useful ingredients in primary urine , such as water and amino acids . 
Both the " artificial nephron " and the " artificial renal tubule " are made of hollow fibers . In addition , the interior of the artificial renal tubule is fully lined with renal tubular epithelial cells which have the ability to decompose metabolic waste . 
The epithelial cells can decompose the causative substance of dialysis - related amyloidosis , a disease caused by repeated hemodialysis , into amino acids and return them to the blood while reabsorbing into the blood the glucose , vitamins , and minerals the body needs . 
In contrast , previous artificial kidneys , depending on the difference of osmotic pressures to filter metabolic waste , were unable to remove that completely and nor did they have the ability to return ingredients such as amino acids to the blood . 
Researchers tested the bio - artificial kidney transplant on goats , using a pig 's epithelial cells to line the interior of the hollow fibers of the artificial kidney . 
Two weeks later , researchers confirmed that the artificial kidney had been able to function . 
They are presently developing a bio - artificial kidney using human renal cells and will start clinical studies after testing its safety . 
Safe Power Production in China Still Faces Serious Challenges 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , Feb. 13 ( Correspondent An Bei ) A senior official from the State Electricity Regulatory Commission said on the 13th that although power production safety remained generally stable in 2005 , safe power production still faces serious challenges . 
At the fifth ( expanded ) meeting of the National Commission for Safe Power Production held here , SERC Vice Chairman Shi Yubo said that in 2005 China 's power production safety was generally stable , while power supply during the peak summer season was successfully and safely accomplished . Active efforts were made to cope with the effects of natural disasters , and the safe and stable operation of the power supply system was basically ensured . Accidents involving power production safe 
Nevertheless , he noted that along with changes in the power supply and demand situation and the operation of a large number of newly - built power generator units added in succession , safe power production will face new challenges . 
Included in these challenges are : regional , seasonal , and periodic power shortages will continue to exist ; the power supply and demand situation in some regions will remain quite tight ; the lack of a good mechanism for coal pricing for power generation will continue to result in relatively big coal supply problems , while at the same time , the lack of effective control over the declining quality of coal will produce serious impact on the stable operation of power generator units ; so 
Shi Yubo said that with the deepening of electricity system reform , many contradictions at deep levels will continue to emerge . How to maintain a stable working staff and ensure normal production order will become new problems . 
With regard to power production safety work in 2006 , Shi Yubo said that efforts should be made to further strengthen the basic administration of power production safety ; accelerate the establishment and improvement of administrative mechanisms for power safety emergencies ; enhance capabilities for handling emergencies ; step up coordination and cooperation among power producers and power grids so as to jointly maintain power system safety ; continue to effectively supervise dam safet 
It was learned that in connection with the new power safety administration situation , this year the SERC will carry out revision and improvement of the Provisional Regulations on Investigation of Power Production Accidents that were issued . Meanwhile , supplementary documents concerning dam safety for hydro - electric power stations and protection of secondary power systems will be released in succession for implementation this year . 
In 2005 , electricity consumption by all sectors in China reached 2,468.9 gigawatt - hours , up 13.45 % year - on - year . 
Faced with adverse situations such as tightening power supply and demand , and increasing problems with coal , electricity , and oil transportation , various power producers took effective measures , stepping up management of infrastructure . In all of last year , throughout the country , no exceptionally large infrastructure accidents occurred in power production . 
There were 74 grid accidents , down 127 cases year - on - year , and 427 infrastructure accidents , down 132 cases year - on - year . 
South African Minister Plenipotentiary in China Says No " Organized " Crimes against Chinese Citizens in South Africa 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , Feb. 13 ( Correspondents Wang Jiangang and Hao Yalin ) Minister Plenipotentiary Vusi B. Koloane , charge d 'affaires ad interim of the South African embassy in China , said in an exclusive Xinhua interview on the 13th that there are no " organized " crimes against Chinese citizens in South Africa . 
At the same time , he said that the South African government will try its best to " crack down on all forms of criminal activity . " 
Vusi B. Koloane said that the South African government hopes to " reduce to zero " the crime rate and hopes that the life and property of every foreign national working in South Africa will be fully protected by the local law and citizens . 
Since 2006 , four Chinese citizens have already been killed one after another in South Africa . Chinese communities have shown widespread concern about this . 
In response to this , the Chinese Foreign Ministry has made representations to South Africa and also reminded Chinese citizens in South Africa to further step up vigilance , enhance unity and friendship among Chinese compatriots , and cooperate with police to jointly combat crime activities . 
" We express our sincerest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims . " 
Vusi B. Koloane said : " We apologize for this and assure the Chinese people that the South African government is earnestly investigating every single case involving Chinese nationals . " 
According to the Chinese embassy in South Africa , South African police have successfully cracked the February 5 case in which Chen Jianqing , a Chinese woman from Fujian , China , was killed in South Africa . A suspect has been arrested . 
At present police are after another suspect . 
Also , according to the disclosure by the South African embassy in China , the criminal involved in the shooting of a Hong Kong businessman in January of this year has been arrested by South African police , with the property of the victim recovered . 
Speaking of the impact that these incidents of Chinese citizens being killed may have , Vusi B. Koloane thinks that the incidents " indeed " will have some negative impact on exchanges in trade , tourism , and other fields between the two countries , but the impact " should be fairly small " in the long run . 
According to the briefing by Nyembezi , tourism attache of the South African embassy , the embassy issued more than 2,000 visas to Chinese nationals going to South Africa in the first 15 days alone of this year . 
In addition , according to the Chinese official statistics , South Africa continued to maintain its position as China 's largest trade partner in Africa in 2005 . 
The bilateral trade volume reached 7.27 billion US dollars , growing 23 % year - on - year . 
However , tourism professionals think that the serial killings of Chinese citizens in 2004 have significantly affected the number of Chinese tourists to South Africa . 
According to the statistics of South Africa 's tourism bureau , the number of Chinese tourists to South Africa in the first half of 2005 was 20,331 , a 14.9 % year - on - year decrease . 
Currently , some 200,000 Chinese nationals live in towns and rural areas across South Africa . 
Analysts here attribute the high crime rate to the large gap between the rich and the poor , high unemployment rate , rampant use of guns , and lack of death penalty in South Africa . 
As many Chinese nationals do not understand English and have cash with them or in their homes , they are more likely to become targets of attack by criminals seeking their money .

The Plan requires that AIDS counseling and testing centers be set up in locations convenient to patients and that individual rooms should be provided for one - on - one counseling so as to protect patients ' privacy . 
While selecting counselors , full consideration should be given to such factors as personal character , sense of responsibility , scope of knowledge , and communicational skills . 
In order to protect the privacy of patients , testing forms can be coded or numbered for registration . 
The Plan also requires that health administrative departments above county level should publish in the major local media the list and phone numbers of local medical facilities that provide free and voluntary AIDS testing so that the public can have an easy access to relevant information . 
Supervision against Extracting Confessions through Torture Still Focus of Work for Ministry of Public Security 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , Feb. 14 ( Correspondent Meng Na ) While answering foreign correspondents ' questions at a press conference held by the Ministry of Public Security on the 14th , Zheng Baigang , deputy director of the Ministry 's supervision department , pointed out that the so - called " use of inappropriate methods to make criminal suspects confess " is absolutely prohibited in China . 
In addition , preventing such problems from happening is a major focus of work for the supervision department . 
He also noted that some international organizations do not have a comprehensive and correct understanding of the situation of law enforcement by Chinese police . 
The latest data provided by the Ministry of Public Security on the 14th reveal that in 2002 and 2004 the Ministry of Public Security successively issued the Provisions on the Implementation of Detention Measures and Record - keeping by Public Security Organs and the Provisions on Application of Further Interrogation by Public Security Organs , which have more effectively ensured that grass - roots public security organs carry out detention and interrogation measures in accordance with a 
Since 1997 , in order to further push for the " three rectifications " ( namely , rectify the extraction of confessions by torture , rectify the abuse of arms and police equipment , and rectify the abuse of coercive measures ) police supervisory personnel of public security organs nationwide have been persistently making open and secret trips to grass - roots and frontline law enforcement units such as police stations , criminal police teams , police patrol teams , traffic police teams , venues 
In order to prevent law enforcement problems where they originate , police supervisory departments have further broadened the scope of law enforcement supervision and stepped up supervision and inspection of components of law enforcement , such as the application of subpoena measures , inquiries and interrogations , 110 police call processing , statistics on case filings , disposal of assets involved in cases , security officers who ticket fines and penalties , and data recording of automo

Peking University Sets Up Mourning Hall in Memory of Academician Wang Xuan 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , Feb. 15 ( Correspondent Li Jiangtao ) After a few days of intensive arrangements , a mourning hall in memory of academician Wang Xuan set up in the Centennial Memorial Hall at Peking University officially opened at 9:00 a.m. on the 15th . As of the noon this day , hundreds of people have come to pay their respects . 
Some time after 8:00 a.m. , a long line of dozens of people formed outside the door before the opening time of the mourning hall . 
Inside the mourning hall at PKU 's Centennial Hall , this reporter saw a black banner hanging from the wall of the hall which read " Deep Condolences for Academician Wang Xuan . " 
Beneath the banner was a huge 10 - plus square meter portrait of Wang Xuan . Wearing a pair of glasses , he looked scholarly with a gentle smile on his face . 
The portrait was flanked by several cypress trees and dozens of wreaths . 
One of the wreaths had this elegiac couplet : " Originated in the Qin , thriving in the Tang , a good foundation was laid in China ; bidding farewell to lead type , ushering in electronic type , the modern Bi Sheng drew up the blueprint . " 
The mourning hall was ensconced in funereal music in a solemn and heavy atmosphere . 
Among the mourners were leaders , teachers , and students from PKU as well as Wang Xuan 's friends , colleagues , students , and neighbors . In addition , many people not acquainted with him at all also made special effort to come . 
Some of them held fresh flowers in their arms , while some carried flower baskets . All had small white flowers pinned on their chests . Slowly they walked up to the portrait of academician Wang Xuan and bowed to express their condolences . 
Many people could not hold back tears . 
Zhang Wenbin , former director of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage and a PKU alumnus , told reporters that more than ten years ago , when he was still working in Henan Province , he once invited Professor Wang Xuan to give a report on scientific and technological innovation to provincial Party committee cadres . 
" Academician Wang Xuan set a very good example for us both in character and academic discipline . He made great contributions to the country and society . People will never forget him . " 
Professor Jin Ruilin from PKU Law School was Wang Xuan 's old friend and neighbor for more than four decades . 
Just discharged from the hospital a few days ago , he insisted on coming to say farewell to his old friend today . 
As he left a message in the remembrance book , Mr. Jin could not contain his sadness and wiped away flowing tears several times with tissues . 
He told reporters that Professor Wang lived a very simple life . " He was already a professor with high achievements when he lived in Tongfu Garden , but he stayed in a very small flat for many years . 
Later he moved into Chengze Garden and stayed in a unit of about 70 or 80 square meters for more than ten years . 
When PKU assigned him to a large unit of over 140 square meters in the Academician Building in Lanqiying , he did not want it . He did not take the high - rise unit provided at Fangzheng Building either . " 
Mr. Jin recalled with deep emotion that during Wang Xuan 's visits abroad , he was given great offers to stay abroad , but he resolutely refused them all . 
" At first he insisted on not applying for the title of academician . It was only after Mr. Zhou Peiyuan 's repeated pleas that he filled out the form . " 
What also deeply touched Mr. Jin was Wang Xuan 's attitude toward young people . " He himself emphasized many times , what can be achieved by looking at myself now , not at myself , on the contrary , I should mentor young people . " 
Mr. Jin said that Wang Xuan started to focus on mentoring young people when he was in his 50s . He constantly stressed that he wanted to pave the way for young people and that he wanted to be their stepping stone . 
" It is really not easy for a scientist with great accomplishments to do this . " 
This reporter learned from the PKU News Center that the mourning hall in memory of academician Wang Xuan is open to the public for people of all walks of life to pay their respects from 9:00 a.m. to 16:00 every day , starting from 9:00 on the morning of February 15 through noon on the 19th . 
Known as " the modern Bi Sheng , " Professor Wang Xuan of Peking University , vice chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC , an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering , and an academician of the Third World Academy of Sciences , passed away at 11:03 on February 13 after medical treatments failed at Union Hospital in Beijing .

China to Issue Information Network Publishing Rights Protection Rules 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , Feb. 15 ( Correspondents Zhou Wei and Li Fei ) At present , many websites rely on republishing large quantities of news reports from newspapers and magazines to increase their hit rates , but many are not authorized to do so and have not paid any fees . In response to this , Wang Ziqiang , director of the copyright division of the National Copyright Administration , said at a press conference held by the Information Office of the State Council on the 15th that 
Wang Ziqiang said that according to the provisions of the current law , as long as authors do not make a statement prohibiting use , newspapers and magazines can use works already published in newspapers and magazines without the consent of authors while paying compensation . The National Copyright Administration has specifically set forth the compensation standards for republishing by newspapers and magazines in accordance with the provisions of the law . 
However , according to the provisions of the current law , newspaper and magazine publishers have this legal right while no such legal permission is given to the internet at this time . 
According to the relevant legal interpretation given by the Supreme People 's Court , the legal permission to republish given to newspapers and magazines can be applied to the internet , that is , as long as authors do not make a statement prohibiting use , small articles published in newspapers , magazines , and on the internet can be used online without permission while compensations are made . 
However , since the legal interpretation does not stipulate the compensation standards , in reality such works are used on the internet without being given any compensations . 
" Whether the legal permission is applicable to these published short works used on the internet still needs to be confirmed legally . " 
Wang Ziqiang said : " Whether it will be included into the scope set forth by the law still needs to be confirmed by the Information Network Publishing Rights Protection Rules to be issued this year . " 
( International ) Russia 's Peacekeeping Mission Not to Be Affected by Georgian Parliament Resolution , Russian Military Says 
Xinhua News Agency , Moscow , Feb. 15 ( Correspondent Song Shiyi ) Sedov , an official from the Russian Defense Ministry 's press service , said in his speech to the media on the 15th that the Georgian parliament resolution regarding the Russian peacekeeping force will not affect the peacekeeping mission of the Russian troops in the short term and that the Russian troops will continue to carry out their peacekeeping mission in the South Ossetia conflict zone . 
Kokoshin , chairman of the CIS Affairs Committee of the Russian State Duma ( lower house of the parliament ) , noted this day in his speech about the Georgian parliament resolution regarding the Russian peacekeeping force that the Georgian resolution will undermine stability in the region and adversely affect Russian - Georgian ties . 
He stressed that the Georgian parliament resolution has pushed the relations between Russia and Georgia further toward deterioration . 
He thinks that Georgia 's accusation against Russia was absurd . 
The Georgian parliament passed the resolution this day , calling for the Russian peacekeeping force to stop its peacekeeping mission in South Ossetia but did not finalize the specific deadline for the withdrawal of the Russian peacekeeping force . 
The Georgian parliament accused Russian peacekeepers of failing to comply with specified obligations and considered Russia 's operation in the conflict zone " an attempt to annex the territory of Georgia . " 
The Georgian parliament called on the government to adopt proactive actions in considering the replacement of the current Russian peacekeeping mission in the South Ossetia conflict zone with an international peacekeeping force . 
The Georgian parliament also called on the government to amend the relevant agreement stipulating Russian peacekeepers ' presence in the conflict zone . 
South Ossetia is an autonomous state of Georgia , bordering the Russian republic of North Ossetia . 
After the dissolution of the former Soviet Union , it announced independence by itself and has been in long - term hostility with the Georgian central government . 
At present , Russia has a battalion of 500 peacekeepers stationed in the region . 
This contingent was deployed in South Ossetia according to a 1992 four - party agreement signed by Russia , Georgia , North Ossetia , and South Ossetia .

( Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan ) Taiwan Authorities Heavily Fine Leading High - tech Company on Grounds of Illegal Investment in Mainland 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , Feb. 16 ( Correspondent Chen Jianxing ) On the 15th , Taiwan 's official economic affairs department decided to fine United Microelectronics Corp. ( abbreviated as UMC ) , one of Taiwan 's two giant chipmakers , NT $ 5 million on the grounds of " illegally providing assistance to and participating in the establishment of " mainland - based Hejian Technology Company . 
Taiwan 's China Times reported that this is the first case of Taiwan authorities fining a Taiwanese business for investing in the mainland since Chen Shui - bian proposed a cross - Strait economic and trade policy advocating " active management and effective opening . " 
According to reports , officials from the " MOEA Investment Commission " said that UMC was fined because it violated the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area and the Regulations Governing the Approval of Investment or Technical Cooperation in Mainland China . 
In the future , the " MOEA Investment Commission " will also fine former UMC Chairman Tsao Hsing - cheng and others , depending on the situation . 
The UMC case originated in February 2005 when Taiwan 's prosecution and investigation departments deployed nearly a hundred personnel in raids on the residences and offices of several top UMC officials , claiming that UMC was suspected of illegally " providing funds , technology , and human resources " to Hejian Technology , its mainland investment . 
Tsao Hsing - cheng , UMC chairman at the time , subsequently stated publicly that UMC had not violated any regulations of Taiwan authorities and that UMC provided assistance to Hejian Technology in the long - term interest of UMC , since UMC would lose business opportunities if it did not get into the mainland market as soon as possible . 
Following that , Taiwan 's official Financial Supervisory Commission fined UMC NT $ 3 million on the grounds of violating relevant regulations concerning business information disclosures . 
On January 9, 2006 , the UMC Board of Directors accepted the resignation of Tsao Hsing - cheng , who a few hours later was officially indicted on suspected illegal investment in the mainland . 
UMC , along with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co . , Ltd . ( abbreviated as TSMC ) known as Taiwan 's two giant chipmakers , is a leading high - tech corporation on the island . 
The series of moves by Taiwan authorities to investigate and punish UMC over the past year have attracted great attention from all sectors of society on the island .

State Administration of Work Safety : Prevention of Frequent Serious and Large - scale Coalmine and Other Accidents is Top Priority This Year 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , Feb. 17 ( Correspondent Liu Zheng ) With a series of four coalmine accidents each killing more than 100 people , the grim work safety situation throughout the country last year has made " prevention of frequent serous and large - scale coalmine and other accidents " the top priority of work safety efforts nationwide this year . 
On the 17th , this reporter learned from SAWS that in order to truly prevent frequent serious and large - scale coalmine and other accidents , coalmines must be the top priority . 
With regard to coalmine safety this year , SAWS will effectively carry out the following three tasks : 
- - Continue to effectively tackle the tough issue of controlling methane . 
This year " ventilation first , mining second " will be featured in controlling methane . 
If coal mines with high concentrations of methane do not implement " ventilation first , mining second , " they will be ordered to immediately stop production in accordance with the law . 
- - Continue to effectively tackle the tough issue of restructuring and shutting down . 
Resolutely and tightly shut down every one of the 5,243 coalmines which have been publicly announced and the other 700 - plus coalmines widely reported recently . 
Consider shut - downs to be routine work and continuously shut down those coalmines that destroy natural resources , pollute the environment , and do not maintain safety measures . 
- - Enhance basic coalmine safety administration . 
Promptly rectify and halt administrative declines in a handful of large state - owned coalmines and guide small coalmines with chaotic management to set up standardized safety management systems . 
In particular , emphasis should be placed on key state - owned coalmines , absolutely prohibiting production that exceeds capacity , exceeds the intensity threshold , and exceeds the established number of workers . 
This year 's work safety control targets call for a reduction of the nationwide death toll from various kinds of accidents by 3 % from the previous year , with a reduction of 3.5 % for coalmines . 
The number of large - scale accidents causing more than 10 deaths should be reduced by 5 % , with a reduction of 7 % for coalmines . 
People 's governments at the provincial level have all been informed of these control targets , which are being passed down to various levels for implementation at grassroots levels and in companies in all localities . 
Statistics show that in 2005 , 5,986 people died in coalmine accidents nationwide , down 0.7 % year - on - year . 
However , the number of large - scale accidents causing more than 10 deaths went up , with the death toll rising by 66.6 % year - on - year .

( Winter Olympics - Stimulants ) News Analysis : Pyleva Case Likely to End Where It Is 
Xinhua News Agency , Turin , Feb. 17 News Analysis : Pyleva Case Likely to End Where It Is 
Xinhua Correspondents Gao Peng and Ding Ying 
Although Italy has said repeatedly that all athletes found using stimulants during the Turin Winter Olympics may face " prison sentences , " based on various circumstances at this time , such fate is unlikely to happen to Russian biathlete Olga Pyleva , the center of the first stimulant scandal at this Winter Olympics . 
On the 16th , the first stimulant scandal broke out at the Turin Winter Olympics when Olga Pyleva was found to have used carphedon , a banned drug . 
The next day the International Olympic Committee announced that Pyleva had been expelled from the Winter Olympics . In addition , she was stripped of the individual biathlon silver medal for women 's 15 km event she won at this Winter Olympics . 
On the same day , the International Biathlon Union decided to give Pyleva a two - year ban from the competition . 
It has always been the IOC regulation that athletes found using stimulants at the Olympic Games be subject to revocation of their achievements and the eligibility to compete , but they are not subject to legal sanctions . 
However , under Italian law , athletes ' carrying and using stimulants are considered criminal acts . Prosecution agencies have the right to directly arrest and investigate athletes on stimulants , and violators also face a prison sentence of between three months and three years . 
In December last year , after " bargaining " for a year , the IOC and the Italian government finally reached an agreement , under which the two sides will deal with cases of athletes using stimulants at this Winter Olympics in accordance with the Italian law . 
Through the untiring efforts of the IOC , the Italian side made concession four days before the Winter Olympics opened , promising that police would not enter the Olympic village to raid athletes ' quarters during the Winter Olympics , but athletes tested positive for drugs are still subject to investigations of Italian prosecutors . 
Some reports said that Pescante , an Italian government official supervising the Turin Winter Olympics , has already turned over the case of Pyleva using stimulant to Turin 's prosecutors . 
However , the IOC and Pescante himself so far have not confirmed it yet . 
Russian biathlon team doctor Andrey Dmytriev disclosed at noon on the 17th that Pyleva has already left Turin for her country . 
Shi Kangcheng , a Chinese sports official who formerly worked at the World Anti - Doping Agency for many years , thinks that once Pyleva returns to her country , this incident may eventually " end where it is . " 
Shi Kangcheng said that the IOC and the Italian government have never " thoroughly resolved " the anti - stimulant issue at the Winter Olympics . Even if the Italian prosecution agency really gets involved in this case , the outcome is still hard to tell . 
Based on Italy 's penalties on its own athletes in the previous cases of stimulant abuse , the maximum penalties violators got were only " two - year deferred imprisonment . " 
Therefore , Piaili , a senior reporter from the Italian news agency ANSA , said that there is " little " chance that Pyleva will go to jail . She would just face fines at maximum . 
Piaili also said that although the Italian court can hold a trial in absentia , the Italian police will not be able to go abroad to catch Pyleva and bring her back for serving the sentence . 
If Pyleva refuses to accept the judgment , the Italian side will not be able to do anything to her . 
Comprehensive News : Countries All over the World on High Alert as New Epidemic Outbreaks Continue to Emerge 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , Feb. 18 Comprehensive reports by Xinhua correspondents abroad said that bird flu continues to spread further on the African continent . 
The WHO confirmed on the 17th that birds that died from infection with bird flu virus have been found in three areas in Egypt . 
In Europe , the H5 strain of bird flu virus has also been discovered for the first time in France . Europe and Africa are on high alert and stepping up epidemic prevention measures . 
WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional Advisor Hassan Bushra told the news media in Egypt on the 17th that dead birds infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus have been found in three areas of Cairo and Giza in central Egypt , and Minya in the south . Relevant departments of the Egyptian government have already started to slaughter fowls that are suspected of being infected with bird flu . 
Experts noted that as Egypt is an important passageway for migratory birds in the Middle East and North Africa , it is highly likely that migratory birds may bring the bird flu virus to the country . 
Egypt has announced a ban on the import of live poultry from abroad and stepped up inspection and quarantine practices at the ports of entry . 
In Yaounde , capital of Cameroon , more than 800 chickens on a chicken farm died mysteriously in the past week . 
Cameroon has decided to immediately suspend the import of all poultry and pork from Nigeria , where a bird flu epidemic occurred , and put a temporary stop on the trade of poultry and related products on all markets along the border between the two countries . 
In addition , the government of Cameroon has promptly set up an epidemic monitoring network across the country . The Pasteur Centre in the country and the State Veterinary Laboratory are on high alert , ready to carry out testing related to the H5N1 virus at any time . 
In Europe , Denmark and Sweden preliminarily ruled out the epidemic on the 17th . 
The National Veterinary Institute in Sweden released the test results of the dead swans discovered Wednesday , which showed the Swedish swans were not infected with bird flu virus . 
The preliminary results of tests by the Danish Veterinary Administration also show that the thirty dead swans recently found within Denmark were not infected with bird flu virus . 
However , the agriculture department said that Denmark still cannot afford to be off guard . 
Since this year , nine outbreaks of bird flu have occurred in Romania in eastern Europe . WHO experts said in Bucharest on the 17th that since bird flu broke out in almost all places in the Danube Delta region , the situation must be addressed seriously as Romania may be constantly threatened by bird flu in the next three or five years . 
In the Asian country of Bangladesh , the government has taken all necessary preventive measures against bird flu . 
The government 's Department of Livestock Services has provided relevant books on bird flu prevention to relevant officials and organized domestic fowl breeders for training . 
( Magazine and Newspaper Excerpts ) China 's First Blood Information Sharing Administration System Established in Zhejiang 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , Feb. 18 According to a disclosure by the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province , China 's first blood information and data sharing administration and control network system was officially completed and put into operation at the center recently . 
A relevant administrator at the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province said this means that from now on , citizens will be given a unique code after participating in a blood drive with any county ( city or district ) blood collection / supply agency in Zhejiang Province . The next time he / she donates blood , just by inputting the relevant code , information such as personal data , blood type , blood donation history , time of the last blood donation , and whether blood can be donated this time wil 
The administrator further explained that if , after inputting the code , the system shows an inadequate lapse of time between blood donations , the system will indicate that conditions for blood donation this time have not been met . 
This way not only protects blood donors ' health but also more effectively protects blood users ' health and safety . 
In addition , when blood supplies are tight , priority will be given to blood donors and their families for the use of blood . You just have to input the valid blood donor certificate , and information about the blood donor will instantly appear . It is extremely convenient . 
According to a report by Hangzhou 's Today Morning Express , at present , the information system has been put into use at all 36 blood collection agencies in the province . Blood resource data at all blood collection / supply agencies across the province have real - time display capability , thereby achieving data sharing throughout the province . 
Eleven Villages Urgently Evacuated in Philippines to Prepare against Another Landslide 
Xinhua News Agency , Manila , Feb. 18 Philippine local officials said on the 18th that eleven villages in the eastern Philippines were urgently evacuated to prepare against another similar landslide . 
Rosette Lerias , a Southern Leyte official , said this day that these villages are located in the same area as the village where the landslide occurred on the 17th and have similar features . 
Residents evacuated from the eleven villages will be placed in seven evacuation centers . 
Lerias said : " The government ordered residents to evacuate yesterday and sent people to check these villages today because some people were reluctant to leave their homes . " 
The landslide on the 17th occurred in a hillside village in the town of Saint Bernard in Southern Leyte Province . The TV image showed that mud and rocks have buried the entire village with only a few rooftops visible . 
Since the mud was extremely thick and wet , the chance of survival for those buried underneath was very slim . 
So far 109 people have been found dead while another 57 people were rescued . 
It was estimated that the death toll from this disaster may reach 1,800 . 
( Life in Hometowns of Overseas Chinese ) First Month This Year Sees Year - on - year Growth of 35.2 % in Exports in Southern Fujian City of Quanzhou , Hometown of Overseas Chinese 
Xinhua News Agency , Fuzhou , Feb. 19 ( Guo Yu ) In January this year , foreign trade exports in Quanzhou City continued to maintain its momentum of fast growth . 
According to the customs statistics , in January exports in Quanzhou had the best performance in history and increased by 35.2 % year - on - year , higher than the average growth rate in the province , to 330 million US dollars . 
According to the analysis by the Quanzhou Municipal Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Bureau , the city 's fast growth in foreign trade in January was attributed to the effects of several foreign trade support services measures in Quanzhou , which have highly motivated companies for exports , vitalized economic operations in Quanzhou , increased business confidence of companies , and provided an efficient and smooth environment for foreign trade development . 
Championship Hopeful but not Assured 
Love Life , Love Luneng 
The fire will soon be lit on the battlefield of the Chinese Super League . 
Luneng Taishan is getting ready for the new season and preparing to fight again for the championship . 
The fight for the championship among Dalian , Shandong , and Shanghai is on the verge of breaking out . 
Who will win the championship in the end ? 
Based on an analysis of strength , although the Taishan team has great hopes of winning the championship , it is not 100 percent assured . 
First , new team members have little time to get adjusted . 
The Taishan team had four major openings last year . 
This year , following recruitment of the two famous national football players Li Leilei and Wang Liang , the Taishan team will soon be joined by two foreign players . Its strength should be said to have increased without decreasing . 
However , since the national team is preparing for matches with Palestine and Iraq , there has hardly been any coordination between the national team players and their teammates . 
By the time they return to the team , the Super League will be starting . 
Therefore , the problem of getting adjusted is the biggest problem the Taishan team now faces . 
In my opinion , the national football players can serve as substitutes in the first few Super League matches . 
First , the games can be used as practice to get the team adjusted . 
Second , it can allow the players who have just finished two group matches with the national team to take a rest . 
After sharpening their skills in several matches , it will not be too late to enter the battle . 
The next problem is the hidden troubles on defense . 
Last year , the Taishan team 's defense was criticized by football fans . 
This year , defense has been improved somewhat with the recruitment of Li Leilei , but it 's not yet time to rest easy . 
The central back still has a problem with turning around slowly , while the substitute players are either slightly old or lack sufficient experience . 
If the central back can put forth a stable performance this year , then the Taishan team will have a greater chance of winning the championship . 
I think it may be a good idea to use Ren Yongshun , who is in good physical shape . Despite insufficient experience , he can test himself this year and prepare for the future . 
In addition , it is also fine to recall Gao Yao to play sweeper . 
There are quite a few members of the Taishan team who can play defensive midfield . Both Cui Peng and Haibin can play . 
Gao Yao , who is physically strong and fierce in intercepting the ball , should be able to do a good job as central back . 
Also , whether the foreign players can adjust themselves ... 
Issues with foreign players have constantly been a big problem for the Taishan team . 
Last year , Danciulescu 's performance left much to be desired . 
I know the foreign players for this year have not been determined yet . 
I think that this year , in addition to recruiting an excellent striker , a pure left midfielder should be recruited . 
Except for Xing Rui a few years ago , the Taishan team has not had a single true left - footed specialist . 
Although Cui Peng and others are all competent , however , a real left midfielder is still much better than a stand - in . 
If these three problems can be resolved well , the road to the championship for the Taishan team should be a bit smoother . 
As a Shandong football fan , I hope very much that the Taishan team will win the championship this year . 
However , to be honest , based on this year 's competitive situation , the Taishan team has great hopes but there are few assurances . 
Batey Ads Merges with JWT Network , Would It be Too Late to Say Happy New Year ? 
BrandVista Post : 
Hello , everyone . 
Once again Spring Festival is behind us . Our friends who combined their vacation days with Spring Festival holidays are returning to their work . 
Wish all friends a Happy New Year , if it is still not too late to say Happy New Year . 
When I was chatting with NPLCN in a cafe the other day , he mentioned the current BrandVista . 
The website has become much prettier . 
The layout of the content is pretty good . 
What he likes most is still the recent fully revamped Discuz - based community BBS . 
Speaking of the community , I will have to thank one person . 
That is Mr. Li Mingshun , general manager of Discuz Beijing company . 
If you search for his name on Google , you can get a lot of hits . 
I roughly know that he used to be at Sina and later started his own business , an internet ad exchange platform for small and medium - sized businesses , similar to adbrite.com abroad . 
At that time he debated on MSN to the effect that Vista thinks that the development of many sectors in China all depends on private economy and growth of small and medium - sized businesses . 
However , the situation in this respect in China 's markets now is not encouraging . 
Therefore , the creative media sector and the similar consulting sector serving small and medium - sized businesses are unable to grow into large scale . 
Charging higher fees to facilitate its own development eventually led to an unfulfilling cycle . 
Later he came to Discuz . 
Discuz is an excellent community software based on PHP and MySQL database . 
With the help of Ramboo , a technical engineer in Beijing , the BrandVista community finally saw hope again and emerged with a brand - new look . 
The feedback is excellent . 
The interface is clean - cut and friendly . 
The speed is quite fast . 
Writing some texts inspirational both to myself and to others on a freshly clean - cut interface and exchanging details in my work and life with friends of the same aspiration working in the same industry , I started to think this is a kind of happiness . 
Thanks , Discuz ! 
There has been quite a lot of news lately in the advertising sector . 
Starting from January , the WTO regulations on the liberalization of advertising went into effect . 
Large foreign companies have been arriving at the scene , while smaller foreign companies are getting ready . Prosperity seems to be everywhere . 
Batey Advertising , which originated in Singapore , has encountered quite a lot of trouble . 
After losing several heavyweight clients in a row and suffering a series of setbacks in its development in mainland China , Sir Martin finally found some time away from the lawsuit in Italy to think about reshuffling his cards . 
Batey Advertising , Batey will merge with the JWT network while keeping its brand name under the JWT management . 
In the meantime , there is rumor that Bates and the 141 network will soon merge with OgilvyOne and will be managed by the OgilvyOne ad network . 
Though 141 earlier reported it to OgilvyOne , it would be interesting for Bates Asia to report it to OgilvyOne . 
During the Spring Festival several articles have been updated on the website . I will not go into details here . 
You may go check them out on the website if you have time . 
At the same time , those friends who have not entered the new forum may as well make an extra click to access the brand - new community at BrandVista 
to experience the environment and atmosphere as well as to contribute some texts . 
Hope you will feel the happiness of finding where you belong . 
Wish all friends a beautiful state of mind . 
Best wishes !

Mom Ten Years Ago 
Helen Li 
I saw this article and want to share it with you . 
This is not out of a momentary impulse but of warmth and kindness cherished long at heart . 
I asked myself how I would act if it were me . 
The answer was very clear . I would put down the phone with a " You dialed a wrong number . " 
I have been thinking this year what exactly can be considered helping others . 
I have already given up those momentary actions such as making monetary or material donations . 
Two days ago , a friend said , I have already no time to take care of myself . Even if I want to help others , I will not have the energy to do it . 
Wish you a pleasant day : )

Mom Ten Years Ago 
On that day ten years ago , when this teacher was taking a nap at home during noontime break , the telephone rang suddenly . 
She picked up the phone and listened , yet out came a strange rough voice : " We have caught your kid stealing a book . Come here quick ! " 
Coming from the other end of the line was a little girl 's crying £ ¬ along with loud scolding voices of others . 
Glancing over at her only daughter , who was watching TV nearby , it suddenly dawned upon her . 
Obviously , a little girl must have got caught by the sales person while she was stealing a book . As she did not want to let her family know it , she must have made up a phone number at random . That was how they happened to call here . 
Of course she could put down the phone and ignored the call . She could also even reprimand the other party , 
because this incident had nothing to do with her . 
However , being a teacher , she thought she might be her own student . 
The phone call gave her some rough idea that the little girl , who made the momentary slip , must be very much frightened and was facing perhaps the most horrifying situation in her life . 
Hesitating for a moment , an idea suddenly occurred to her . Right , just do it this way . 
So , after making sure about the bookstore 's address , she hurried there . 
Just as she expected , a tearful little girl was standing in the bookstore , 
while adults nearby were yelling at her in fierce reproof . 
She rushed up to hold the poor little girl in her arms . Turning around , she said to the sales person nearby : " Talk to me . Don 't scare the kid . " 
Amid the sales person 's reluctant mutterings , she paid the fine of about a few dozen yuan before she was able to lead this little girl out of the bookstore and take a close look at that tear - smudged , terrified face . 
She laughed and took the little girl home . She gave her a good cleaning and let the girl go without asking anything . 
Before she took off , she made a special effort to tell her repeatedly , if you want to read books , just come to the auntie 's place . There are many books inside . 
The little girl , who had still not yet recovered from her horror , took a close look at her and scampered away . She never reappeared . 
Time went by like a rushing stream . Ten years had passed in a flash before she knew it . 
Having long forgotten this thing , she still lived here , leading a quiet and peaceful life . 
One day at noon , there was a series of knocks on the door . 
When she opened the door , she saw a stranger , a pretty young girl with all smiles on her face and her hands full of gifts . 
" Who are you looking for ? " 
She asked doubtfully . 
In her excitement , that girl said a great deal . 
Only with great efforts in following the narration of that girl , a stranger to her , did she suddenly realize that she was that little girl of that year . She had graduated smoothly from college after ten years and now took this trip purposely to visit her . 
With her eyes glistening with tears , the young girl said softly : " Though I have never understood even today why you were willing to pretend to be my mom to help me out , I have always felt all these ten years that I want to call you mom . " 
The teacher 's eyes also grew blurry . 
She asked curiously : " If I had not helped you , what would have happened ? " 
The girl 's face immediately darkened . She gently shook her head and said : " I am not sure . I could have done something foolish and might have even committed suicide . " 
The teacher 's heart trembled , and she started to feel rejoiced secretly . 
The decision she made on the spur of the moment that year turned out to have had such an impact on one person 's life . 
Looking at the happy smile on the girl 's face , she also smiled . 
Zhang xiwen 
When this world is filled with lies and fraud like junk text messages everywhere , Buddha said , if I don 't go to hell , who else goes to hell . 
If anyone has done this , then congratulations , because he could become Buddha earlier . 
Human beings at their birth are naturally good . 
Compassion lies in the heart of every human being . 
The moral degeneration of the world is getting worse day by day . People are not what they were in times past . 
Perhaps only self - sacrificing Buddha can do some good deeds . 
Observation on Military Situation : How Long Would Iran be Able to Hold on Against US Military Air Strikes ? 
Yun Feiquan 
If we liken a traditional war of attrition to making the enemy bleed to death , then modern warfare is firing a bullet right into the enemy 's head at the outset , turning it into a " vegetable " with no time to bleed . 
The difference between Iran and the US in military power is not in the numbers but in their understanding of modern warfare . 
Iran , which fought an eight - year war with Iraq without any distinguishable winner , does not seem to understand the real significance of modern high - tech warfare . 
The British International Intelligence Review recently mentioned , after analyzing US military deployments , that US troops are preparing to launch a large - scale air strike on Iran ... 
The current status of the Iranian Air Force is rather worrisome . 
The current status of the Iranian Air Force is very similar to the pre - war Iraqi Air Force in 2003 . 
The home country does not have the ability to develop modern weapons independently and is also under the arms embargo imposed by the West . 
Upon the breakout of war , it is quite uncertain whether the old and outdated planes of the Iranian Air Force could take off and fight the US military . 
Currently , Iran 's air defense system is chiefly composed of the air force and land - based air defense force of Iran 's regular military as well as the air defense force of the Revolutionary Guard Corps . 
Among these , the Iranian Air Force is currently about 50,000 strong and has more than 300 fighter planes of various models . 
The main plane models are US - made F-4 Phantoms , F-5 Tigers , and F-14 Tomcats , and Russian - made MIG-29s , among others . 
The land - based air defense forces are mainly equipped with US - made Hawk , British - made Arrow , and some Russian - made Sam series surface - to - air missiles . 
Analyzing the current status of the Iranian air defense forces , Harold Hutchinson , a US military expert , Khramchikhin , a military expert at Russia 's Institute of Political and Military Analysis , and others think that looking at the current situation , there are still some holes in Iran 's air defense capabilities and its air defense system construction . 
Hutchinson thinks that in terms of overall real power , the Iranian Air Force is absolutely not at the same level as the US military . 
The large number of US - made fighter planes Iran has are inoperable due to lack of spare parts , upgrades , and maintenance . 
Of the F-14 fighters , once considered the trump of the Iranian Air Force , currently only 10 - plus can take off . 
It is also questionable whether the AIM-54 Phoenix missiles that they carry , which are said to have over - the - horizon attack capability , are reliable in actual battle . 
Khramchikhin mentioned that the air defense missile systems that the US provided to Iran in the 1970s and 1980s have lost combat power due to lack of spare parts . 
Some other non - system air defense weapons acquired from Russia and other countries are no match for the US military , which is capable of electromagnetic countermeasures . 
Scraping it together has an effect on combat power . 
The Iranian government obviously also realizes that its fate in war depends on its ability to defend the home skies . In a last - minute effort to update its weaponry , it scraped together all it could get to reinforce its air defense system . 
From what can be seen at present , its methods can be summarized into two . 
First , work hard to conceal key nuclear facilities to enhance its capability to defend against attacks . 
According to a report by the British newspaper the Times , Iran has concealed the core parts of nuclear facilities such as the Natanz nuclear plant and Isfahan uranium enrichment center as deep as 18 meters underground and encased them with 2 - meter thick cement protection . 
However , the US military is a step ahead , having seen the effects of underground bunkers during the 1991 Gulf war in defending against air strikes , it rushed development of various kinds of ground penetrating bombs . 
After more than ten years of targeted research , the US military now has a complete package of combat methodology and weapons to deal with reinforced underground bunkers . 
Iran has recently also bought large quantities of air defense weaponry from Russia . 
Since the end of last year , the Iranian government has made successive agreements with Russia to purchase the Pechora-2A air defense missile system , along with 29 sets of the Tor-M1 air defense missile system worth 700 million US dollars . 
However , modern warfare is a competition between systems . 
The various air strike weapons of the US military were all developed independently by their own country . Furthermore , after years of real war experience , they have been adapted into a set of impressive and effective war machines . 
In contrast , whether the " new weapons " Iran gathered from other countries and put together can become a combat force within such short period of time is still an issue . 
Iran is not lagging behind in weapons only . 
The Army Field Manual published by the US military in 1982 proposed for the first time the doctrine of " Air Land Battle , " which emphasizes attacking the enemy 's deeply strategic and high - value targets using air superiority to paralyze the enemy 's command system at the start of the war so that the enemy can become nothing more than " meat on the chopping board " no matter how powerful its regular military strength . 
In the 1991 Gulf War , the 1999 Kosovo War , and the 2003 Iraq War , the US military cared not about how many planes the enemy had but the range of its own Tomahawk cruise missiles . 
Although the Iranian government has been preparing for possible air strikes and has started taking measures to enhance its air defense capabilities , Iran , which fought an eight - year war with Iraq without any distinguishable winner , does not seem to understand the real significance of modern high - tech warfare . 
Along with the US military 's progress in recent years in military transformation work , the US military 's air strike operations already completely differ from Vietnam War era carpet bombing , depending instead on various kinds of high - tech weapons and on modern information technology - based high precision and full depth air attacks . 
Confronted with such air strikes , it is still unknown how long Iran 's land - based air defense system would be able to hold on .

Joining Hands with Google in Battling Microsoft , Dell Charges Software Vendors " Shelving fees ? " 
Yun Feiquan 
Dell Inc . ( US : DELL ) and Google confirmed on Tuesday that Dell is testing personal computers that have installed Google Pack . 
This move may pose a severe threat against Microsoft 's (MSFT) dominant position in the PC software market . 
Dell press spokesman Jess Blackburn indicated that the company is evaluating Google 's software . 
After installing this software , PC users can use the software to search the web as well as search for information stored on the PC . 
Blackburn confirmed that at this time , the software being tested by the company include a Google - supported Dell homepage , Google Desktop Search , and Google Toolbar . 
At the same time , Google press spokesman Jon Murchinson also confirmed that his company and Dell were testing a bundle of software developed by Google . 
Earlier , the Wall Street Journal reported that IT upstart Google was in the process of negotiations with Dell and Hewlett - Packard Co . , among others , in hopes of convincing these computer manufacturing giants to include Google software in their PCs . 
According to insider sources quoted by the Wall Street Journal , Google may pay up to 1 billion US dollars to Dell over the next three years to achieve this goal . 
However , the two companies did not reveal any of the relevant details . 
In addition , Hewlett Packard refused to comment . 
Microsoft press spokesman Neil Charney refused to comment on the above news . 
As of now , Microsoft is planning to release its next - generation Windows operating system search tool and boost its development of web services . 
On the day the news was released , Google 's stock price again dropped by 4.46 % to 367.92 US dollars . 
Microsoft 's stock price fell this day by 1 % , closing at 26.94 US dollars . 
Some analysts pointed out that Google is urgently seeking directions for growth outside of web search . Joining hands with PC giants such as Dell may cause Google to threaten Microsoft 's core business . 
Matt Rosoff , an analyst from market research firm Directions on Microsoft , indicated that Google is in a rush to expand its revenue sources , which is definitely something Microsoft is concerned about . 
However , some analysts are rather unimpressed . 
Charles Di Bona , an analyst from market analysis firm Sanford C. Bernstein , pointed out that it is still too early for Google to shake Microsoft Windows ' dominant position . 
Reporter 's note : Google Shaking Microsoft 's Throne ? 
Huizhengyi 
Computers have doubtlessly become a necessity for modern people in their life and work . 
However , while everybody uses a computer skillfully , only a handful of people actually know the operating principle of a computer . 
Just as using a " foolproof " camera , as long as the interface is friendly and software is easy to use , most beginners can equally feel comfortable operating such a black box as a computer . 
Therefore , PC 's manufacturer - installed original software will often determine the usage habits of most consumers . 
It is exactly through this measure that Microsoft commands a solid control of the PC operating system market . 
Now , Google , Microsoft 's new rival , also intends to have its finger in the pie through this means . 
A well - known economics media outfit recently used a very interesting metaphor for this . 
" Dell , Hewlett Packard , and other computer manufacturers started to treat their computer products as supermarket shelves and charge software companies " shelving fees . " 
Winning bidders can have their software appear in the 'critical ten minutes ' when users start their new computers so as to guide consumers to use their products . 
This mode of charging fees resembles the way supermarkets charge food suppliers shelving fees . " 
Doubtlessly , this phenomenon indicates Microsoft 's control is being loosened . 
Microsoft 's managers warned Bill Gates that if Google began to pay PC manufacturers to have their computers installed with Google software when they are shipped out , then Microsoft 's hegemony will eventually be threatened . 
No matter what will be the outcome of the situation , Microsoft 's stable and easy days as number one may become history . 
After all , it is easier to win the throne than to keep the throne .

Sword of Justice : Prospects for 2006

Sword of Justice : Prospects for 2006 
Author : Sword of Justice 
I remember that at the beginning of 2005 , Hong Kong 's Apple Daily published an article entitled " As Falun Wheel Revolves , its Contributions Rival Those of Government . " 
The article called 2004 a year of great advancement for Falun Gong . 
The article gave many examples of how overseas CPC officials completely lost their manners in suppressing Falun Gong on various occasions , while Falun Gong practitioners told the truth all over the world , making the CPC completely lose face . 
However , in comparison with the vast massive wave of withdrawals from the party triggered by the " Nine Commentaries " in 2005 , the year 2004 did not seem impressive . 
- Well , what will things be like in 2006 ? 
From two incidents that occurred at the beginning of this year , we can probably see some clues about this year 's developments . 
One is the publication of " Eliminating Evils " by the Falun Gong founder . This article announced the imminent doom of those who became CPC spies after July 20, 1999 . 
Perhaps many people are still skeptical about or cannot believe this article . 
Yet , whether believing it or not , history and facts will be the proof ! 
Of course , CPC spies are like rats living in the sewer . 
Their " natural or accidental " deaths won 't rouse social or public attention . 
But the widespread natural elimination of or repentance by CPC spies both at home and abroad will surely produce a powerful impact and shock to the CPC power structure . 
Stunned and awed by the power of natural elimination , they will have to seriously consider their route of retreat and survival - withdrawal from the party , defection , or counterattack . 
Consequently , " the CPC ultra stable bureaucracy group " maintained by filthy interests will start to shake , crumble , and collapse ! 
Another incident is the hunger strike protest movement initiated by Gao Zhisheng to safeguard human rights . 
This movement , which started suddenly and was not regarded by people as having potential at the beginning , on the contrary received an unexpectedly enthusiastic response from around the world , and a joint response from various sectors and forces at that . 
If this movement can become a tie to gather various forces of justice and the suffering masses , making it a widespread success , then there is hope that an external force will take shape from this to serve as the last straw for the unstable , evil CPC regime . 
If we say 2005 was a year in which the CPC was destroyed spiritually , then 2006 will begin a phase in which the CPC will be eliminated both spiritually and materially . 
With the further spread of the " Nine Commentaries " and the deepening wave of withdrawal from the party , with the internal collapse of the CPC and the convergence of external forces of justice , the life of the CPC devil will officially enter the count - down period . 
The intent of heaven and the people is harmonious ; the power of God and the people are converging . 
The giant sword is pointing directly at the CPC devil . 
If we say 2004 was a year of great advancement and 2005 was a year of surging momentum , then what will be the final conclusion for 2006 ? 
I hope it is stunning transformation and triumph !

Subject : Xu Zhiyong : A Letter to Li Qun , Linyi Municipal Party Committee Secretary - Hooliganism May Also Harm Yourself 
Mailing station : feel like old friends at the first meeting ( Wed Feb 8 13:56:14 2006 ) , this station ( yjrg.net ) 
As of yesterday the Linyi government under your leadership had illegally put Chen Guangcheng under house arrest for 165 days . 
You people have colluded with hooligans and underground society in taking illegal custody of a lawful blind citizen for a long time . 
You people have cut off the phone line in his home and installed a cell phone interference device in his courtyard . 
You people have also beat him and his family members several times . 
You people 's barbarism has exceeded the bottom line of a civilized society . 
In early October 2005 , you people acted like hooligans in the underground society and beat Attorney Li Fangping and me , but we put up with it , always trying our best to understand the difficulties you people are in . We even acquiesced for some time after you people put Chen Guangcheng under house arrest . 
However , 165 days have passed . Instead of refraining yourself , you people even have become more unscrupulous . 
You people dispatched regiments of police and hooligans to harass villagers . 
You people continued to detain and beat villagers . 
You people have gone too far ! 
Today , as you continue to organize hooligans in the underground society to hem in Chen Guangcheng , I remind you explicitly that acting as hooligans in the underground society may backfire and harm yourself . 
Things at the very beginning should have warranted your reconsideration . 
Family planning in Linyi ranked at the bottom in the entire province . 
It was understandable that you felt somewhat worried as a municipal party committee secretary . 
However , you were wrong to think that people in Linyi are so crude that force must be used to implement the national law and policy . 
Whose fault was it if citizens did not cooperate with the government 's action ? 
Was it because citizens were crude or because the government has a poor public credibility as a result of its numerous lies and tricks over a long period of time ? 
If the same action by the government ten years ago did not appear that absurd , don 't you think your barbarous action was way out of line in 2005 when the Chinese society had achieved remarkable progress and when the human rights protection had been written into the Constitution ? 
Why don 't you reexamine yourself as to how it was that your Linyi alone dare do such things ? 
How could it be that your Linyi alone could not implement the law using the means of democratic rule of law ? 
After Chen Guangcheng and a number of brave citizens reported the truth about the barbarous way of implementing the law , after Teng Biao and a number of legal professionals daring to safeguard citizens ' rights got involved , and after the National Family Planning Commission made the conclusion of the investigation , Linyi should have offered a sincere explanation to gain the understanding of the public . 
After all , family planning is a tough subject with Chinese characteristics . 
People could also have understood your difficulties . 
Yet , you people instead adopted an absurd move - catching Chen Guangcheng in Beijing and bringing him back to be locked up . You even attempted to incriminate him in the name of illegally supplying state secret intelligence . 
Don 't you think this criminal charge very absurd for a blind person living in a poor mountain village ? 
In fact , as long as you people have really corrected your mistakes and as long as you people have done a good job , would you be afraid of the criticism by a blind person ? 
Would you people find it necessary to dispatch tens of people to watch him 24 hours a day and even feel so exasperated as to convict him ? 
On October 4, 2005 , Attorney Li Fangping and I went to Dongshigu Village . We made our position very clear and hoped to resolve the contradiction . 
We proposed that we could talk with your officials first to find out what idea and request you people had . 
We offered to help you persuade Chen Guangcheng not to make certain remarks . 
It was our hope that you people should not treat a blind person this way and that both sides should make some concessions . 
However , your policy makers were bent on having your way , and furthermore , even " masterminded " an incident of beating and illegally detaining us . 
Do you think you can scare us this way ? 
We have not done anything illegal . 
We are not afraid of anything . 
Although the rule of law in China is imperfect , it is not so bad as to allow lawlessness . 
If you think you can scare us by using the tricks of hooligans in the underground society , then you have far underestimated our resolution and willpower . 
As long as we want , we have many people who have many lawful reasons to go to Linyi or visit Chen Guangcheng . 
You can beat attorneys and scholars once , twice , and three times . Each time there will be widespread attention and coverage . 
Do you people dare to beat us ten times ? 
Don 't you care very much about your official position ? 
In case someone is injured by beating , is your position really that secure ? 
Playing some lowly tricks of hooligans instead of listening to our reasonable advice , don 't you think this is not only foolish but also risky ? 
I want to tell you clearly that in China there is a large number of excellent citizens who follow their conscience and abide by the rule of law . 
We are not afraid of hooligans and the underground society . 
We cannot tolerate the reckless trampling of the bottom line of human civilization . 
If you are going to the extreme , we will go toward your batons and sticks with confidence and ease in groups and by turns until the moment you retreat . 
You should know clearly that using the tricks of hooligans in the underground society will not be of any good to you . 
Don 't think you can extricate yourself from those local ruffians and hooligans who beat up villagers as long as you stay behind the scenes . 
Finally , I also want to remind you to treat Chen Guangcheng well . 
Blind since a child , he graduated from a college of traditional medicine and taught himself law and English . He once sued the Beijing subway company in the interest of the blind people , and he introduced running water for the villagers . He is known far and wide as " Attorney Chen . " 
You people went so far as to have shameless villains create rumors online slandering him and even attempted to convict him of a crime of supplying confidential intelligence illegally to overseas recipients . Don 't you think you have gone too far by doing that ? 
It is illegal for you people to put Chen Guangcheng under house arrest . It is also risky to you . 
Originally , you people could have released him with no trouble . 
Since the barbarous implementation of the law has stopped , how long will he go on criticizing if left unchecked ? 
But , you people are now continuing to smear your own image . 
As long as Cheng Guangcheng is not free , you people will never have peace . 
You people have tortured him enough . 
If you even want to convict him or resort to further hooliganism , we will never look on with folded arms .

( fwd ) Do Chinese People Deserve Democracy ? 
Explore Road to Peaceful Liberation of China and Advance spiritual Emancipation of Chinese People . 
I am very disappointed to admit that the Chinese people do not deserve democracy ! 
Aren 't the people posting here doing just that ? 
It is just a pity that not many people will read it online ( compared with 1.4 billion ) . 
Among netizens , even fewer people are concerned with or participate in topics like this . I dare say it is less than 1 % of netizens ! 
What 's more , this network is equipped with the Golden Shield , the world 's largest , most comprehensive , most advanced , most expensive , and highest quality project ! 
Indeed . 
Depressed , disappointed , helpless , even thinking of submission , but if I want to live a human life , who else can I count on but myself to make it happen ? 
Though man proposes , God disposes ; even if I failed ... I would think that it is my fault and that I deserve to live like a dog if I have not tried hard for my own ideals . 
The very act of working hard for justice will add some beauty to my own life , at least in my own heart , in my self - appraisal . 
In fact I don 't have to worry about the future of China at all . 
That 's because the global environment has made it impossible for the existence of a regime that has not held elections for a long time . 
This is just a matter of time . 
I only lament that the Chinese people have such luck that at turning points of history , they have always been led by devils of an international and monstrous stature on a road to hell along which your bones are beaten and your blood is sucked out of you . Just to think that some people call glorious the bones of the dead and the puddles of blood along this road , and even force us to be proud of such glory . 
Dark night falls everywhere , but it is the longest in the Divine Land of China . 
The Qin Emperor plus the sage Confucius brought huge disasters to people . 
While the First Qin Emperor openly ruled as a tyrant , the sage Confucius brainwashed in the shadows . 
It is not that the Chinese people do not deserve democracy , it is that their democracy gene is gone , having been made to regress . 
For a nation that has existed for more than three thousand years , this nation should have long practiced democracy if there was an element of democracy in its national culture . 
When a democratic system was established in Athens , when a republic was founded in Rome , when the Magna Carta was approved by the British people , when the French people were issuing the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen , and when Americans were issuing the Declaration of Independence , what were Chinese people doing ? 
Before the Mongols took control of the Central Plains , khuriltai were used to elect emperors . The Manchus long ago had the Council of Princes and Ministers to practice democratic administration . Why did it all evaporate once they came to the region of the Han people ? 
Chinese pursue material things and are not interested at all in spiritual beliefs and political rights . 
Believe it or not , at the price of a stuffed pancake , Chinese people would sell you their universal suffrage if they had it . 
After half a million years , if the Chinese want democracy , the earthquake will surely be coming . Run if you can !

Dalai 's Special Envoys Meet with Chinese Officials behind Closed Doors 
CGP Beili 
Dalai 's special envoys meet with Chinese officials behind closed doors . 
The Dalai Lama stressed that he wants autonomy , not independence , for Tibet . 
The special envoys of the Dalai Lama , Tibet 's spiritual leader in exile , are having closed - door meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing with no details released . 
This is the fifth official meeting between China and the Dalai 's government - in - exile since contacts resumed in 2002 . 
However , as always , the two sides met behind close doors with no details revealed . 
Reporters said that the two sides held talks several times but so far no substantive results have been achieved . 
The Dalai Lama , who is in exile in northern India , said that he wants autonomy , not independence , for Tibet . 
The Chinese side refused to comment on the bilateral talks . 
However , analysts said that Beijing wanted to have the dialogue partly because it is worried that Tibetans ' dissatisfaction with the Chinese rule may escalate should this 70 - year - old spiritual leader in exile die . 
Cultural Identity 
The delegation of Dalai 's government - in - exile was led by Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari , who was also chief representative to several previous talks . 
A spokesperson for the Tibetan government - in - exile said that the several rounds of talks they had with Chinese officials in Switzerland in 2005 were very " close and frank , " bringing hopes for Tibetans . 
The spokesperson said that their ultimate hope is to resolve the relevant issues on the basis reached through negotiation with the Chinese leadership so that Tibetans will have the freedom to preserve their cultural identity , which they consider important . 
CGP Beili 
Dalai Lama 's Special Envoys Reiterate they do not Seek Tibet 's Independence . 
The Dalai Lama will go to visit Washington this month . 
Prior to the Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama 's visit to the United States on November 8 , his special envoys said that the Tibetan government - in - exile would not demand for Tibet 's independence . 
Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said in Washington that he hoped the Chinese government would indeed preserve Tibet 's unique culture and tradition . 
During his visit to the US next week , the Dalai Lama is expected to discuss the Tibetan issue with President Bush in hopes that Bush can urge the Chinese government to give Tibet genuine autonomy . 
Dalai 's representative had direct contact with Beijing officials for the first time in Berne in July of this year . 
" Genuine Autonomy " 
Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari noted that in recent years the Tibetan government - in - exile has seen some positive aspects when meeting with Chinese authorities . 
The Dalai Lama 's special envoys found that Beijing leaders , especially the representatives from the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee , were more willing than before to hear their opinions . 
However , Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said that the Tibetan government - in - exile still has too many disagreements with the Chinese government and that there is a very big difference between the positions of the two sides . 
He said that during the past five years the Tibetan government - in - exile has tried its best to meet the Chinese request for creating a good negotiation environment . 
China should also create a good environment for negotiations on the Tibetan issue instead of suppressing the Dalai Lama unrelentingly . 
He said that the Dalai Lama does not demand independence for Tibet . Tibet is still part of China , but the Chinese government must preserve Tibet 's unique culture so that " Tibetans will have genuine autonomy . " 
In addition , Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari noted that some Chinese think the Tibetan issue will disappear once the Dalai Lama dies . 
He said that this idea is very dangerous because China will lose a historic opportunity to solve the Tibetan issue once the Dalai Lama passes away . 
He said that as long as the Chinese government responds to the requests of the Dalai Lama and proposes a final resolution , the Dalai Lama will not need to talk about the Tibetan issue internationally . 
Negotiation And Compromise are Important Democratic Methods ! (ZT) 
Houze 
I just saw a post by a net friend on The Great Spirit : To Old Mr. Guiren . 
His / her original words were " negotiation and compromise are important democratic methods , or else , splitting because of disagreements is the failure of democracy ! ! ! I hope idealistic democrats will pay full attention to this point ! " 
This bland remark that has not roused interest among any net friends led me to indulge in a train of thought while all sorts of feelings welled up in my mind . 
At this time , I thought of ancient China as well as the past of the West . 
Seldom posting topics , I could not help replying to the post of this net friend in the form of a topic post . 
Let 's take a look first at ancient China . 
Everybody knows that beginning with the First Qin Emperor , China has constructed a large and unified centralized power system , with all dynasties that followed operating under this political framework . 
Although a " double - track system " was temporarily implemented in the Han Dynasty , that is , a political system consisting of a dual coexisting feudal system and centralized power system , after all , there was still a centralized power system in the end . 
The effect of this kind of centralized power system under the conditions at that time in history had its progressive side , had its aspect of promoting the development of forces of production . 
However , we should also see that the prolonged period of more than 2,000 years of running this system resulted in a lack of creativity , initiative , and activity in local areas , making it even less possible to formulate , based on local conditions , various kinds of regulations and policies appropriate for local development . 
The pyramid - like system of government also caused lower - level officials to only look upward , following every detail of orders from higher levels . 
Since all local officials in the county government were appointed by the central government , they had no room for coordination and negotiation among themselves , let alone with those ordinary citizens . 
When their rights were infringed upon , peasants in ancient China could do nothing but put up with it time and again . 
Only when their most basic rights were threatened , that is , when their rights of existence were deprived by widespread famine , tyranny , and natural disasters , would they rise in revolt with sharpened sticks . 
Over 2,000 years , several peasant uprisings spread like storms across the country , from the spontaneous Chen Sheng Wu Guang Uprising to the plotted Yellow Turban Uprising , to the Huang Chao Riot in the Tang Dynasty , as well as the one - month dynastic rule as a result of Li Zicheng 's uprising . Except for Zhu Yuanzhang , none achieved victory in the true sense of the word . 
Even the Ming Dynasty established this way by Zhu Yuanzhang was still nothing but a rotating replacement of other dynasties , with no change in the system . 
Born a commoner with little education , Zhu Yuanzhang implemented ancient China 's centralized power system to a sickening extreme . The brimming vitality characteristic of the Tang Dynasty , born of openness , freedom , and tolerance , was replaced by stagnant lifelessness . 
The free speech atmosphere vanished from the land of China for some time . 
Human nature suffered utmost suppression . 
Everyone became overcautious and dared not talk too much , from fear and trepidation . 
The result of this sole successful peasant uprising over 2,000 years turned the Chinese people into subhuman beings for a period of time . 
Now let 's take a look at the Middle Ages in Western Europe , known as the Dark Ages . 
The Middle Ages in Western Europe was a period of one thousand years which came about after Western Rome was destroyed by nomads and had nothing to do with the previous ancient Greece and Rome . 
This period was characterized by fiefdoms , namely land fiefdoms . 
Landlords at lower levels had more independent power . 
Whether they were small feudal lords with territories extending a few kilometers or the nobility of dukes , marquises , counts , viscounts , and barons who appeared on formal occasions , as people of various ranks were able to mutually check and balance and depend on one another , with the conditions and abilities to fight for their legitimate rights from the king , there were scenes of kings and noblemen sitting together for negotiations of their own respective interests , scenes never s 
They made mutual compromises and concessions instead of overthrowing or superseding other parties by using force . 
This way , by means of various kinds of contracts , rights were continuously granted to noblemen and commoners , and with increasing power for noblemen and commoners , the king 's rights became increasingly diminished . 
In the end , the British queen became only ceremonial , with no actual power . 
Democracy was gradually realized through this method ! 
Let 's come back to make a comparison with ancient China , with all power centralized in the hands of the emperor ( except for Li Shimin ) and with almost no noblemen . It would be hard for peasants to sit with the king at the negotiating table over a cup of tea and a glass of wine , making mutual compromises and concessions in a relaxed and pleasant manner and formulating contracts to the satisfaction of the two sides . 
Under such circumstances , when the right of existence was deprived , the only way remaining was to overthrow the existing dynasty by force and try to replace it . 
Consequently , there was a repeated rotation , from the heyday of the Tang Dynasty to the morbidity of the Ming Dynasty . 
Comparing Chinese history with Western history , we find there seems to be no Western country where conflict between the ruler and the ruled was as aggravated as it was in ancient China . 
In no Western country were peasant uprisings as frequent as in ancient China . 
In Western countries , when conflicts between ancient royal households and peasants arose , noblemen and commoners would first think of achieving resolution through negotiations to protect their own interests . They would make some mutual concessions to gradually win more rights , while force was rarely used . 
Understanding this , you will see that even as we enter the 21st century , some democratic " fighters " on the internet , having inherited the idea of the ultra , absolute totalitarian system of the Ming Dynasty , 
and also because their bodies are eroded by the poison of the Cultural Revolution , these democratic " fighters " can talk about nothing except annihilation and overthrow . 
Yet it is this kind of ideology that is the largest obstacle to democracy , because these people don 't understand that negotiation , consultation , and compromise are the most important methods and approaches for realizing democracy . 
Cao Xiaoming : Who Foots Bill for Enriching Rural Cultural Activities ? 
Houze 
This Spring Festival , this writer was lucky enough to spend the holiday in rural China and visit some relatives and friends . 
While impressed by the rich festive atmosphere in rural China , I was also concerned with the drab cultural activities in the countryside . 
This writer found in one village with friends and relatives that previously at Spring Festival each year , this village would spontaneously organize villagers to put on a local theatrical show called " Revolving Lantern . " 
Both adults and children could play roles in this show based on characters in the Three Warring Kingdoms . The villagers never grew tired of watching it . 
There were several performing teams for " Revolving Lantern " across the township . They not only performed in their own villages but also visited other villages , creating liveliness through their exchanges . 
However , this year this village no longer organized it . 
It turned out that a large sum of money was needed for purchasing costumes alone for " Revolving Lantern . " In the past , costumes were bought through fund raising among the villagers , yet they are now too worn out to wear . 
Asking villagers door to door for money again , nobody wanted to do it . Similar situations also occurred in several other villages across the township . 
Without the " Revolving Lantern , " the village suddenly became cold and cheerless . 
Adults started to play mahjong . 
Children also started to play poker . 
Villagers all said there was nothing going on for this New Year festival . 
Setting off firecrackers or playing mahjong has now become one of the major features of the New Year celebration in rural areas . 
Meanwhile , gambling persists in spite of numerous bans and is tending to spread further . Winning or losing as much as 10,000 yuan in a single game has even become commonplace . In particular , a large number of peasants returning from their migrant jobs outside have become major players at gambling houses . 
Their money earned by their own sweat over a whole year thereby goes down the drain . 
In addition , gambling - related family disputes frequently occur . Some even lead to tragedies of divorce and death . 
Some peasants say they gamble not only during the New Year festival , but also frequently participate in gambling during the slack season . 
There is no place to go if they don 't gamble . 
It is too difficult to organize some cultural activities , to find some fun in rural areas . 
There are neither facilities nor funds , but also there are no people acting as organizers . 
However , in this regard , what Jiangxi has done is doubtlessly good news for peasants . 
In order to enrich the cultural life of the peasant population , the Jiangxi provincial government , starting in September of last year , not only implemented " theatrical performances funded by the government , operated by the market , supported by townships , provided for peasant enjoyment , " 
but is also allocating at least 60 million yuan annually to a special fund for rural cultural enterprises , so as to bring high - quality cultural products to the rural population . 
At the start of the new year , 10 million yuan was again added , bringing the total amount to 100 million yuan for the establishment of the special fund for rural cultural enterprise . 
Moreover , the " bills " paid with this special fund are for real benefits : 
inviting various kinds of professional artistic troupes to stage performances in rural areas , with at least four performances per year in each township ; 
inviting various movie theater companies to dispatch teams to put on movies in rural areas , with at least six dramas and educational science movies per year in each administrative village ; 
organizing and carrying out mass cultural activities with local characteristics , with at least 2 - 3 events per year in each township . 
From this " purchase inventory list , " it is easy for us to see that the government is not simply providing funds , but trying its best to think about how to use the limited funding to provide what is most needed and to bring value - added cultural enjoyment for the vast rural population . It has done a real job . 
Currently , the vast numbers of peasants are rejoicing about being exempt from paying grain tax to the government . 
If the government can do what Jiangxi did to " foot the bill " for enriching rural people 's cultural activities , it will be another joy from heaven for peasants . 
Furthermore , this " joy " will not only get peasants away from the mahjong table but also get them " active " in cultural activities , which helps add contributions to the construction of new socialist rural areas . 
False Alarm : Wang Peirong 's Child Almost Got Kidnapped 
peirongwangsohu@gmail.com 
Wang Peirong 's child almost got kidnapped , but it turned out to be a false alarm . 
Some time after 9:00 p.m. on January 24, 2006 , Wang Peirong 's child gave a full account : 
On the morning of January 24, 2006 , Wang Peirong 's child was called out by the entrance guard when she was attending a make - up class in physics in the Xuzhou No. 3 Middle School . 
The entrance guard told Wang Peirong 's child that three unidentified men said to the No. 3 Middle School entrance guard , Wang Peirong 's child Wang Tianjiao has not been home for three days due to her parents ' quarrel . 
Now her mother has disappeared . As we are the leaders at her mother 's workplace , we want to go inside the No. 3 Middle School to take away Wang Peirong 's child . 
Wang Peirong 's child said to the entrance guard that what these three men said were all lies , and she refused to go with these three men . 
With the help of the No. 3 Middle School entrance guard , Wang Peirong 's child was not taken away . 
Wang Peirong 's child called her mother 's leader at noon to investigate this incident , and that leader denied having sent anyone to the Xuzhou No. 3 Middle School . 
Wang Peirong 's child got her father 's leader 's telephone number from her . 
Wang Peirong 's child called her father 's leader . 
Wang Peirong 's child said : " Three people came to the No. 3 Middle Scholl and wanted to take me away . " 
That leader asked : " Why didn 't you go with them ? " 
Wang Peirong 's child answered : " I will surely die if I go with them . " 
After saying that , Wang Peirong 's child hung up the phone . 
After hearing what Wang Peirong 's child said , Wang Peirong felt it was a serious case and reported it to police . 
On January 25 , the feedback from the police station was that what Wang Peirong 's child had said was basically true . 
The police station asked the security department of the China University of Mining and Technology whether it had sent anyone to find Wang Peirong 's child at the No. 3 Middle School . The answer was no . 
The police station again asked the CUMT security department whether the work unit affiliated with CUMT had sent anyone to find Wang Peirong 's child at the No. 3 Middle School . The answer was another no . 
The relevant department asked others to tell Wang Peirong and his family to pay attention to their safety . 
After the incident , the leaders of the relevant departments in Xuzhou City took it seriously . 
Through the criminal investigation department of the Xuzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau , the possibility of child kidnapping was ruled out . 
Wang Peirong thanked the leaders of the relevant departments in Xuzhou City as well as the criminal investigation department of the Xuzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau . 
This was a false alarm , and the false alarm was probably caused mainly by the No. 3 Middle School entrance guard . 
The criminal investigation department of the Xuzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau has now confirmed : On January 24 , three people including the leader from the School of Science , Wang Peirong 's workplace , could not find Wang Peirong by phone . As they urgently needed to find Wang Peirong ( Wang Peirong has so far no idea what that was about ) , they thought of going to the No. 3 Middle School to find the teacher of Wang Peirong 's child so as to ask whether the child was in Xuzhou . 
Heavy Topics : Why is There Lower Risk to Engage in Corruption while cost of Anti - corruption is Higher ? 
http://bbs.people.com.cn/bbs/ReadFile?whichfile=44796&typeid=39 
With the current cadre mechanism and the anti - corruption mechanism , a corrupt official need only worry about a handful of relevant officials who supervise him rather than the vast majority of the masses . 
Therefore , once he thinks he has successfully hoodwinked or balanced those few officials who can control his fate , he will feel safe in carrying out his great cause of corruption and wealth accumulation unscrupulously and at will , disregarding how the people close to him feel . 
In contrast , when ordinary people with no power in their hands take the lead in combating corruption at the sight of an injustice , they may likely be met with extremely cruel retaliation and revenge . 
Or they may be also politically labeled against and may anytime suffer the fate of dying before the battle has won . 
Comparing the two : those who practice corruption take less risk while those who combat corruption bear the high cost instead .
