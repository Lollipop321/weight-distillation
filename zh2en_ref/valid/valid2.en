Two Laptop Computers Containing Investigation Materials about the Cause of Princess Diana 's Death Were Stolen 
AFP , London , 6th . 
London Daily Express pointed out that two laptop computers , which contain investigation materials about the car accident and death of Princess Diana in 1997 , were stolen from the office of the former metropolitan police chief . 
The report pointed out that this larceny case has brought people 's speculation that those computers might conceal confidential materials from the investigation led by Stevens , the former metropolitan police chief . 
However , a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police Bureau said that there is no sensitive information or any materials related to the investigation on those computers . 
Sir Stevens is the head of the Northumbria Police Bureau in the UK . His office is located in the Newcastle area on the Thames River . 
The report pointed out that police officers from the Northumbria Police Bureau have been investigating two larceny cases in the past ten days . 
One of the cases occurred during the weekend break from January 28 to 29 , and computers and cash were taken . The second larceny case took place last week , and there were no losses involved . 
The Northumbria Police Bureau also stated that there is no evidence showing that the two larceny cases are related to the work of Sir Stevens . 
Stevens has been investigating whether the cause of the death of Diana , Princess of Wales , was not directly from the car accident . 
Burgess , a royal coroner , issued an ordinance in 2004 to continue searching for related evidence . 
Princess Diana lost her life in a car accident in a Paris tunnel on August 31, 1997 ; her lover Fayed and the driver also died with her . 
After a two - year investigation , the French Police think that the tragedy was caused by the driver , who was drunk and took drugs , drove the car too fast , and lost control of the car . 
The Two Belligerent Parties in Sri Lanka Agreed to Hold Negotiations in Geneva Late This Month 
AFP , Colombo , 7th . 
Norway , as a mediator for the peace process , said that belligerent groups in Sri Lanka agreed to hold negotiations in Geneva , Switzerland , on the 22nd of this month , finally breaking the stalemate on negotiations - which has stagnated for three years - to end the several dozen years of bloody ethnic conflicts pursued by the parties . 
This breakthrough was achieved after Solheim , a Norwegian envoy for peace , met with Balasingham , a negotiation representative for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , in London . 
The Norwegian embassy here said in a statement that " the belligerent parties in Sri Lanka , that is the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , have requested the Norwegian government to assist in holding two - day negotiations from February 22 to 23 in Geneva . " 
The two - day negotiations will focus on how to strengthen the cease - fire agreement effected on February 23,2002 ; this agreement has not been fully complied with by both sides . 
The Norwegian embassy pointed out that , " Both sides will discuss how to improve the implementation of the cease - fire agreement , which is the first time for both sides to have face - to - face negotiations at such a high level . " 
Solheim said that he will lead a Norwegian delegation participating in the negotiations ; Balasingham will lead the four delegates of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , and the Health Minister will be the head of the government ( delegation ) of Sri Lanka . 
He said , " This is a small step but an important one on the road of peace , and it is expected to be difficult for the negotiation process . " 
The previous face - to - face negotiations for resolving the ethnic conflicts in Sri Lanka were held in March, 2003 , in Japan , but the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam cancelled the seventh round of negotiations originally scheduled for Thailand in April, 2003 . 
Turin Winter Olympic Games Unveiled , and Both North and South Korean Delegations Marched into the Stadium together while Holding Hands 
AFP , Turin , Italy , 10th . 
The 20th Winter Olympic Games held their opening ceremony today in Turin , and the delegations from North and South Korea , who were enemies during the Cold War , marched into the stadium together while holding hands during the entrance ceremony . 
Lee Bo - ra , a South Korean women 's speed skating athlete , and Han Jong - in , a North Korean men 's figure skating athlete , were the flag bearers , respectively , for the delegations of the two countries , and led both North and South Korean delegations marching into the Winter Olympic Games stadium . 
This is the first time for the Olympic delegations of both North and South Korea to march together into the Winter Olympic Games stadium while holding hands . 
To reflect the spirit of friendship , reconciliation , and unity of both sides in recent years , the delegations from North and South Korea marched into the stadium when the 2000 Summer Olympic Games in Sydney and the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens were held . 
North Korea did not participate in the 19th Winter Olympic Games held in Salt Lake City , in the United States . 
The Korean Peninsula was divided into capitalist South Korea and Communist North Korea in 1948 , and both sides were enemies during the Korean War from 1950 to 1953 . 
The relations between the two sides were improved after the summit meeting for peace held between leaders of North and South Korea in 2000 . 
According to tradition , the first nation marching into the stadium was the Greek delegation , South Korea was the 22nd one , and North Korea was the 23rd one among the 80 countries to participate in the Games . 
The last nation marching into the stadium was the Italian delegation as the host country . When it entered the stadium , warm welcoming applause immediately rose throughout the stadium . 
Hoffman Used to Be Addicted to Drugs and Fortunately Woke Up in Time and Created His Performance Career 
AFP , New York , 16th . 
Philip Seymour Hoffman , the lead actor in the movie Capote : A Cold - Blooded Confession , who is publicly acknowledged as the one with the most hope of winning Oscar 's Best Actor Award this year , disclosed that he used to be addicted to drugs and liquor and could not give them up when he was young and reckless , but fortunately he was able to give them up successfully , and create his performance career and reach the peak . 
When he was interviewed by the United States ' CBS news magazine 60 Minutes , he softly sighed that he really tried to obtain drugs and liquor by hook or by crook during that period . 
He was little more than 20 years old then , and just graduated from the Drama Department of New York University . Entered into the multi - colored society with its quick - spinning pace of life , he got dizzy with the whirlwind life and lost control of himself . 
He enrolled in a substance abuse treatment clinic at age 22 and gave up his addictive habit of alcohol and drugs there , which was the most panic - inducing period in his life . 
Hoffman is thought of as the actor with the most hope of winning the Best Actor Award at the upcoming Oscar Awards Ceremony next month because of his performance in the movie Capote : A Cold - Blooded Confession , interpreting the American author Capote . 
His great performance skills have been acknowledged long before this , and won the acknowledgements of many awards , including the Best Actor Golden Globe Award . 
The thirty-eight - year - old actor stated in the interview that it would have been impossible for him to be nominated for the Oscar Award if he had not made the painful decision to change his bad habits before he became famous . 
He said that he really admires those beautiful nineteen - year - old actresses who suddenly become famous and rich . 
Signs of Bird Flu Emerge Everywhere in Europe , and People are in a Panic in Nigeria 
AFP , Brussels , 16th . 
Signs of bird flu virus continue to emerge in Europe and send people into panic . 
The Executive Committee of the European Union has passed a resolution for the establishment of additional " buffer area " controls , including all areas of countries where the virus has been discovered for control , and forbidding all trade and transportation of poultries and bird species . 
The bird flu breakouts continue to spread to more chicken farms following the eighth day since the deadly H5N1 virus was discovered in Nigeria , Africa , and tracks demonstrate that it has crossed the northern border of Nigeria and entered into Niger . 
Egyptian officials are investigating the sudden mass death of chickens on a chicken farm in the south , and there is concern that the virus might continue to spread . 
Chicken meat markets in Europe are falling to a great extent because of the impact of the virus event . The Executive Committee of the European Union stressed that there is no reason to panic . 
Jipu Ruinuo , an executive member of the committee responsible for sanitation and food safety , said that it is understandable for people to be concerned about the event but there is no need for overreaction . 
The Executive Committee of the European Union has issued a new regulation and listed all of the European areas where the virus has been discovered as " buffer areas " after passing a previous resolution about the establishment of a three - kilometer protection area and ten - kilometer warning area around every virus discovery spot . 
An official for the European Union , who preferred to remain anonymous , pointed out that everyone is very nervous , and processing news from everywhere in Europe about suspicions of breakouts of the epidemic . 
Until now , the H5N1 virus has been discovered in European regions including Austria , Bulgaria , Croatia , Germany , Greece , Italy , Romania , Slovenia , Ukraine , and Russia , and has been discovered almost exclusively in groups of wild swans . 
On the 16th , Romania discovered its 31st epidemic case , and Slovenia , Austria , Greece , and Ruegen Island in Germany have also discovered new epidemic cases . 
The bird flu virus was discovered in the bodies of two ducks in southern Italy , which are the first poultry infected with the H5N1 virus in the European region , aside from wild swans . 
The greatest concern that European Union officials have is those migrant birds that will be flying back from Africa . 
The Nigerian government is strengthening its work to prevent the human infection of the virus on the African continent . 
The Nigerian government announced that all poultries and bird species must be destroyed within a five - kilometer area of where an infected farm is discovered , regardless of whether they are threatened by the virus or not . 
The government of Niger , its neighbor country , has announced a national warning state , and made an emergency plan by providing 4 million USD to monitor the border areas with Nigeria . 
The newly established National Emergency Committee stated that they have received a report that nearly 400 poultries and bird species are dead in Magaria , a loosely guarded area between the two countries . 
Now let 's look at Iran 's nuclear issue . 
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed on the 6th that the Iranian government had written to the agency requesting the removal of all equipments that monitor Iran 's nuclear facilities by the middle of the month . 
Since the IAEA decided to report Iran 's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council , Iran had announced the termination of all supportive and cooperative measures it had adopted in the nuclear issue , and refused to allow the IAEA to conduct any further surprise inspections of its nuclear facilities . 
Speaking on the tension in Iran 's nuclear issue , Russia 's Foreign Minister Lavrov stated in Athens , Greece , on the 6th that the collaboration between Russia and Iran still exists . 
This will be the driving force in resolving Iran 's nuclear issue . 
A spokesman for Russia 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed on the same day that Russia 's proposal to Iran on building a joint uranium enrichment enterprise in Russia is still effective . 
The two parties may hold discussions on this issue next week . 
On the same day , Lugar , the U.S . Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman , indicated at the UN Headquarters in New York that the United States disagreed with Israel 's attack on Iran 's nuclear facilities . 
Recent reports claimed that Israeli defense experts said that the Israeli air force may deliver a heavy blow to Iran 's nuclear facilities if necessary . 
The Xinhua News Agency reported that Kislyak , Russia 's Deputy Foreign Minister , stated on the 7th that Russia is willing to cooperate with Iran on the nuclear issue , assisting Iran to obtain the legitimate right to peacefully develop nuclear power . 
Kislyak said that Russia 's proposal on a joint uranium enrichment enterprise with Iran is still effective . 
Russia hopes to discuss the issue with Iran soon . 
Russia submitted a proposal to Iran on building a joint uranium enrichment enterprise in Russia at the end of last December . 
The European Union and the United States both indicated that they could accept this compromise plan . 
Iran hopes that Russia can continue to revise the original plan . 
Kong Quan , spokesman for China 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs , said on the 7th that even though the IAEA had reported Iran 's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council , it had not shifted its responsibility to handle Iran 's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council . 
Thus , all parties still have to break the stalemate of Iran 's nuclear issue within the IAEA 's framework . 
According to the IAEA resolution , the agency 's Director - General ElBaradei will submit a report on Iran 's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council in March . 
The UN Security Council will make a final decision after evaluating the report . 
We believe this resolution is asking Iran to fulfill its obligations and commitments , but it is not transferring the IAEA 's responsibility on handling the Iran nuclear issue to the UN Security Council . 
Recently , China has been seeking peaceful resolutions to Iran 's nuclear problem through diplomatic channels for some time . 
Kong Quan said that Zhang Yan , Director - General of China 's Department of Arms Control and Disarmament at the Foreign Ministry , had held talks on Iran 's nuclear issue with Larijani , Secretary of Iran 's Supreme National Security Council and chief negotiator , in Tehran on February 1 . 
China hopes that Iran will take great stock in the emphasis of the international community and create conditions for a peaceful solution to Iran 's nuclear issue . 
To solve the Iranian nuclear issue within the IAEA framework serves not only China 's interest , but also the interest of all parties concerned . 
Therefore , we again call on the parties concerned in the international community not to quit the diplomatic effort that has been conducted on this issue . 
Hamas , which is in the process of establishing the new Palestinian autonomous government , officially announced that the Cabinet list of the new government is ready , except for the Prime Minister candidate . 
This had caused various speculations on the Prime Minister candidate . 
A senior Hamas official revealed to the Associated Press on the 8th that Hamas plans to nominate al - Khudairi , Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Islamic University in Gaza and ( ( businessman ) ) , as the new Prime Minister of the autonomous government , but the nomination has not been formally presented to Abbas . 
Al - Khudairi , 50 , ran in the Palestinian Legislative Council elections as an independent candidate last month with the support of Hamas . 
Al - Khudairi never mentioned anything relating to violence or anti - Israel in his public address . 
However , he had mentioned that internal reform is needed for Palestine . 
A senior delegation from Hamas is currently visiting Cairo to discuss with Egypt the issue of Hamas ' establishment of the new Palestinian government . 
Khaled Mashaal , a member of the delegation , told the press on the 8th that despite the continuous pressure from the international community and some Arab countries , the Palestinian government led and established by Hamas will not recognize Israel . 
Mashaal also issued a warning to Abbas in his statement not to change the structure of the Palestinian leadership without consulting Hamas . 
Analysts believe that this was a response to Abbas 's plan to appoint Interior Minister Youssef as deputy commander of the Palestinian security forces . 
In regard to the establishment of the new Palestinian autonomous government , Mashaal declined to confirm Hamas ' plan to name al - Khudairi , Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Islamic University in Gaza and ( ( businessman ) ) , as the Prime Minister of the government . 
Mashaal said , " We have not decided who we will name as Prime Minister . " 
Before Mashaal reiterated the refusal to recognize Israel , Marzuk , another Hamas political leader , stated during an interview with an Egyptian television station that Hamas will never recognize the legitimacy of Israel , but the new government will keep in touch with Israel in all areas since recognizing Israel and dealing with them are two different things . 
Territorial issues have always been a staggering problem in the Israel - Palestinian relationship , despite all the old and recent grudges between the three Hamas Prime Minister candidates and Israel . 
Olmert , acting Israeli Prime Minister , said during an interview with Israel 's Channel 2 TV on the 7th that Israel has to separate from Palestine through the drawing of permanent borders . 
This implied that Israel must withdraw from parts of the West Bank territory . 
However , Olmert stressed that Israel will maintain control of the Jewish settlement blocs in the West Bank and the Jordan River Valley , and will retain a united Jerusalem .

In regard to the specific compensation figure , we still do not have a definite , exact answer . 
Er , one of them is an insurance , a 400,000 yuan , er , accidental injury insurance . 
Er , the families have not directly contacted the insurance company regarding the compensation , but the work unit represents them to negotiate with the compensation company , er , the insurance company , about the compensation . 
Er , these are what I know about the situation so far . 
Great . Thank you for your live coverage , Li Guangyu .

Even though the bodies of the three murdered Chinese engineers were flown back to China , the investigation into the Pakistani attack continues . 
An hour ago , which was Beijing time 20:00 , Pakistani police and staff at China 's embassy and consulates in Pakistan held a meeting to inform the Chinese authorities about the investigation progress about the incident . 
Now , let us connect to Tao Ye , our reporter who traveled to Pakistan . 
Hello , Tao Ye . 
Oh , hello ( ( ) ) . 
Yes . 
In the meeting held earlier ,

They believed that these people might have provided , er , some clues , offered some information to the murderers , for example , information on when the Chinese engineers left and when they went to certain places . 
Moreover , they might have provided cover for the murderers . 
Well , these , this is what the police are focusing their investigation on . 
According to the police chief , they had interrogated over 50 people in these two days of investigation . 
At present , they are gradually narrowing down the scope of the investigation . 
In addition , after the communication meeting , the police chief and other police officers also went to pay their respects for , er , the three victims at the mourning hall set up at our Consulate General in Karachi .

Er , when answering the inquiry in this matter by our station reporter , the police chief explained that this , this terrorist group is in fact a very loosely organized terrorist group without a complete structure . 
Well , er , % pw , many people claim to be members of this group . 
Well , therefore , for Pakistani authorities , they , er , are still focusing their investigation on many specific people . 
They have not considered the group as % pw a , a key area . 
Good . 
Good , Tao Ye .

Uh , we will continue to follow up on the investigation . 
Thank you , Tao Ye , for your live coverage . 
Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen held a press conference at the Prime Minister 's residence on Tuesday . 
He stated that extremists are exploiting the cartoon incident regarding Mohammed , the founder of Islam , that has developed so far . 
He ( ( said ) ) , " Denmark respects all religions . And we believe in equal rights for everyone . Er , we appeal to the Muslims to exercise restraint and not to resort to violence . " 
Prime Minister Rasmussen and the Foreign Minister held a press conference at the Prime Minister 's residence at 4:30 p.m. on the 7th . 
Rasmussen said , 
" The violent attacks on several European embassies demonstrate that this is not a matter between the Muslim countries and Denmark alone . 
It is of utmost importance to my government and the Danish people that we receive widespread international support on this difficult situation . 
We ally with France . 
We are working in close cooperation with friends and allies in Europe and the United States , as well countries and organizations in the Muslim world . 
Just a few minutes ago , US President Bush called me . 
The President called to express support and solidarity with Denmark . " 
Rasmussen said , " We agreed that the way ahead is through dialogue and tolerance , not violence . 
And we emphasized that freedom and democracy , and respect for all faiths , are crucial values . 
Today I want to appeal to all people in the Muslim countries : Let us work together to stop the violent attacks from expanding . 
We need to solve this issue through dialogue , not violence . 
We are today facing a growing global crisis 
We saw Danish flags being burned and Danish embassies being attacked . 
We saw that Danish people were characterized as intolerant people , or as enemies of Islam . 
That is incorrect . 
Extremists and radicals who seek a clash of cultures to magnify the incident . " 
Rasmussen stressed , " Denmark and the Danish people are not enemies of Islam or any other religion . 
Danes have for generations pursued human rights , democracy , and freedom beyond politics . 
We will continue to do that . 
It is a part of our history and a fundamental part of our society today . 
Denmark is one of the world 's most tolerant and open societies . 
We respect all religions . 
We oppose violence . 
And we believe in equal rights for everyone . "

Iranian extremists angered by the publishing of the Mohammed cartoons attacked the Danish embassy in Tehran again and threw firebombs on Tuesday . 
Meanwhile , an Iranian state - run newspaper held a Holocaust cartoon contest in retaliation . 
The United States condemned the act as an exploitation of the opportunity to strengthen the prolonged presumptuous anti - Israel position of the Iranian President Ahmadinejad . 
About 20 to 30 protesters climbed over the fence and entered the Danish embassy in Iran . 
In addition , as many as 300 people threw stones and firebombs outside the compound . 
The day before , student members of Iranian hard - line militia groups led several hundred protesters in attacking the Danish and Austrian embassies in Tehran . 
The controversial cartoons were first published by the Danish daily Jyllands - Posten last September . 
Other European press and three Arab newspapers reprinted the cartoons , one after another . 
In a tit - for - tat move , Hamshahri , the most - circulated newspaper in Iran , announced earlier that it will hold a Holocaust cartoon contest . 
The action was condemned by countries including the United States . 
McCormack , spokesman for the U.S . State Department , said he saw the initiative by Iran 's largest - selling paper as an extension of Iranian President Ahmadinejad 's campaign of virulent anti - Israeli rhetoric . 
McCormack reiterated US support for freedom of expression throughout the world , including in Iran . 
But he saw no comparison between the plans for a cartoon contest by Hamshahri and the move by Danish media to publish the Mohammed cartoons . 
McCormack said , " I don 't think that anybody would draw any equivalences between , quote / unquote , 'freedom of the press ' in Iran and freedom of the press in Western Europe or the United States . " 
Ahmadinejad once drew widespread criticisms from the United States and other countries for dismissing the Holocaust as a myth and urging the wiping of Israel off the map . 
McCormack suggested that Hamshahri was financed by Tehran 's conservative metropolitan government . 
Holding the cartoon contest at that time was no coincidence . 
Since Attorney Gao Zhicheng launched the countrywide 10 - city synchronized 24 - hour hunger strike on February 14 to protest the oppression of the Chinese Communist Party , 170 Shanghai protesters collectively signed their names to express their willingness to participate in this civil rights action in recent days . 
They also stated that they will continue to publicize the signatures and number of the second group of participants . 
Now , let us watch the coverage by our station . 
According to information , real estate prices in Shanghai have become one of the world 's highest under the government 's speculation . 
Many government agencies try every means to forcibly demolish the houses and resettle residents in high - priced areas , but fail to provide them with reasonable compensation . 
These people who lost their homes due to mandatory demolition and resettlement suddenly lost their income source . 
They cannot afford their children 's tuition fees , so they are afraid to go to school . 
Throughout the years , the majority of the people have earned themselves reform through education time by appealing for intervention from higher authorities . 
According to statistics , Shanghai is the area in China that has the highest number of people who appeal for intervention from higher authorities . 
Han Zhongming originally owned a store , but it was torn down by force ; even his private residence was resold at a profit . 
He was under house arrest and was even detained by the authorities for appealing for help from higher authorities . 
He protested by committing suicide by jumping off a building and cutting his wrist . He was only released recently . 
Chen Enjuan 's store was also forcibly torn down by the government . 
The government hired gangsters to drag the three people in her household outside , and then used a forklift to destroy her house , together with the furniture . 
She had been reeducated through labor for nearly two years for appealing to higher authorities for help . 
When talking about her support for the hunger strike , Chen Enjuan said that besides protesting against the gang - like behavior of the government , 
Attorney Gao has given us much legal assistance and helped us selflessly . 
Our civil rights protest is to demand democracy , because we are also concerned about our next generation . 
The generation before us has already suffered dearly . We need to fight for our next generation , so that they will not be persecuted . Thus , we need to participate in the civil rights protest and cannot give up . 
According to a report published by the Center on Housing Rights and Evictions , a human rights organization based in Geneva , China has been listed as one of the countries in the world that has committed the most serious infringement on housing rights . 
Wang Xin , NTDTV reporter , Gu Qinger , NTDTV correspondent .

The Indian border paramilitary beefed up patrols at the Nepali borders on February 17 . 
Worrying that the upsurge in Maoists rebellions in recent months may infiltrate the border , the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) , responsible for guarding the 200 - mile stretch of India - Nepali border in the Darjeeling district , has increased three battalions . 
Nepal borders at the Himalayas in the north . 
Its other three sides border on India , with a 1,477 - kilometer border . 
Maoist insurgents frequently sneak into Indian border villages and obtain weapons from local gangs and drug dealers . 
Seyana , Deputy Inspector General of Ranidanga , claimed that they will increase from the existing 26 battalions to 36 to patrol the 100 - mile border between the Darjeeling district and West Sikkim .

The SSB will set up 18 Border Outposts to further strengthen border safety . 
Trained police dogs will accompany the SSB on their patrols to detect explosives and narcotics .

After price adjustments , the actual increase in the quarter from October to December had increased by 1.4 percent compared to the last quarter , higher than the 1.2 percent expected . 
The main factors were the strong domestic demand and the growth in exports to major countries such as China and the United States . It had shown a sign of continuous economic recovery . 
This was the fourth consecutive quarter that Japan had showed an economic growth , and the largest since the first to the third quarter in 2005 . It was mainly because of the help from personal expenditures , capital expenditures , and steady exports . 
In addition , Japan 's Central Bank will also terminate its five - year - long extremely relaxed monetary policy in April , thus fostering an expectation for an economic boom in the financial market . 
With the slight improvement in the unemployment rate and wages from October to December , private consumption had increased by 0.8 percent . 
The Nikkei Index rose after the release of the GDP information . However , by morning closing it had dropped 0.74 percent .

Shortly after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) decided to hand over Iran 's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council , Iran reiterated that there is no room for negotiation with the United States , one of the advocates . 
Er , a spokesman for the Iranian government stated on Monday that it has maintained its policy toward the United States of non - discussion and non - negotiation on its relationship with the other party . 
He said that it was a huge mistake for the West to hand the nuclear issue over to the UN Security Council , showing that the West is blocking Iran 's development . 
Iran said on Sunday that it will end the cooperation with the IAEA , resume refining enriched uranium , and ban surprise inspections of nuclear facilities . 
Iran 's attitude toward this issue is quite strong , while the US position is even stronger . 
Er , Rumsfeld , US Secretary of Defense , has stressed repeatedly that the use of violence cannot be ruled out in this issue . 
Well , now there is a rumor that the US military is actually executing such a plan . 
They are developing an ultra - large mother of a bomb . 
Er , this ultra - large bomb will be used to bombard Iran once the Department of Defense gives the order . 
Then , how big is this mother of a bomb ? 
Allegedly , its weight alone is 30,000 lbs , the equivalent of a double - decker bus . Er , moreover , its volume is huge . 
Well , the development of such a super bomb is mainly for the bombing of Iran 's underground facilities . 
Due to its extremely strong penetrating force , it can penetrate cement and sheet steel , and will probably create a large pit of 60 feet by 0.5 mile , er , and will destroy many underground buildings and facilities . 
Well , from what we see , it seems that the United States has actually started to sharpen its weapons or produce bombs at the last moment . 
Rumsfeld claimed that he does not rule out any means in this issue , in resolving Iran 's nuclear issue , and forcible means have been put on the table . 
On the other hand , Iran 's nuclear issue , issue continues to aggravate . Well , er , a relevant Iranian official in China said during an interview with our station that Iran will indeed insist on adopting a peaceful negotiation method to cooperate with the international community , er , hoping to alleviate the crisis . 
However , he also indicated that Iran will adjust the content of the nuclear cooperation project with Russia . 
Speaking on the second round of negotiations with Russia on the enriched uranium project on February 16 , Iran said that the negotiation will be held as scheduled , but emphasized that some adjustments will be made in the negotiation content due to the changes in the current situation . 
Russia had shown its support for Iran 's peaceful utilization of nuclear power , and stated that it would insist on not handing over Iran 's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council . 
However , we saw that they have already agreed to hand over Iran 's nuclear issue to the UN Security Council . 
Now that we have such a new development , we may therefore amend the previous agreement we reached with Russia . 
Before the UN Security Council makes its final decision on whether to impose economic and political sanctions on Iran in March , Iran suggests holding continuous talks with relevant international organizations . It is also willing to cooperate with the international community in order to alleviate the current crisis . 
We stress that Iran will not give up the rights to peaceful use of nuclear power in order to strive for our economic development and the building of our country . 
Iran has not violated relevant international law . We hope that the United States can understand . 
Iran 's nuclear issue is completely different from the Afghani and Iraqi issues . 
I think the United States is also clear on this . 
As for the so - called military attack , we have not seen a clear position from the United States . 
We do not want to see the escalation of the crisis . 
We also emphasize the use of peaceful negotiations , but we will not succumb to pressure . 
In addition , ( ( Agabi ) ) stated that he hoped that China will continue its cooperation with Iran based on its original position .

Let 's look at today 's headlines first . 
The first snowstorm of this winter swept through the northeastern US states and regions along the Atlantic coast this morning . 
Some areas have a snow accumulation of over 60 cm . 
Many airports have been forced to close . 
Over 2,000 flights have been cancelled .

Some small villages have lost contact with the outside world . 
A roof caved in from the snow in Bad Reichenhall , Bavaria , last month , killing 15 people . 
This is a news roundup by Phoenix TV . 
A snowstorm swept through the northeastern region of the United States . Of course , New York is also one of the affected cities . 
We will immediately connect to Luo Xiaoying , our reporter in New York , to understand the local situation . 
Hello Xiaoying . 
Hello Xiaonan . 
Ai . 
What is the situation there under such heavy snow ? 
I heard that some areas are out of power . Is that true ? 
What other areas are affected ? 
It is true . 
In fact , this , this snowstorm covered a huge area . 
I am glad to tell you that the snowstorm has finally stopped now . 
Despite the fierceness of % pw , this snowstorm , no serious casualties have been reported . 
The areas it covers , several states in the eastern United States have been affected . Maryland has 21 inches of snow accumulation , Pennsylvania has 19 inches , New York and New Jersey regions have over 24 inches . 
Snowflakes can be seen from Virginia to Maine , and even Tennessee . 
As , er , you said before , um , it has caused many places in the Washington area and Baltimore to lose power . 
% pw , approximately over one hundred thousand households in total are experiencing a power failure . 
The situation in New York City is better . The loss of power , er , the power supply in the Manhattan district in New York City is normal . There are only some power failures in the Long Island area . 
Rhode Island has declared a state of emergency . 
Only snow plows and emergency vehicles such as ambulances are allowed on the road . 
In transportation , the three airports in the New York , er , area were all closed earlier . 
However , er , later in the evening , we have found that some activities for the reopening of the airports have appeared at the Newark Airport in New Jersey and the LaGuardia Airport in New York . 
Thus , some people anticipate that these airports may reopen % pw , in a few hours . 
For instance , Delta Airlines , Delta Airlines has announced that all the flights in Washington , Philadelphia , Boston , Baltimore , and Connecticut are canceled until Monday . 
The Reagan Airport in the capital city of Washington has reopened . 
The bus services in New Jersey and New York is canceled . 
% pw , the train services have been reduced . 
It is now , % pw , er , now Sunday in New York . It is also the Lantern Festival . 
For us Chinese , originally , some local Chinese communities would have some activities during the Lantern Festival , but they were forced to cancel . 
Most of the Sunday activities of the general New York public are also canceled . Oh , not too many people go out . Well , they all stay home . 
Uh ha . 
People are worrying what to do when they go to work on Monday . 
Um , the snow clearing and the snow accumulation may also cause some flooding . 
Thus , the governments in the affected areas in er , the United States are considering how to handle the crowd and the traffic when people go to work on Monday . 
Xiaonan . 
Great . 
Thank you Xiaoying for the latest coverage from the United States . 
Since there is no other means , all we can do is relax and enjoy this beautiful snow scene . 
Let 's look at some news on Japan . 
Er , Koizumi has always wanted to upgrade the Japanese Defense Agency to a ministry to increase Japan 's military power . 
However , intense debates have been created during the course , and it is full of twists and turns . 
Recently , scandals surfaced during the bidding , during the bidding on construction projects at the Defense Facilities Administration Agency under Japan 's Defense Agency , leading to the arrest of existing and former officials . 
Therefore , many people advised Koizumi to be careful in the course of upgrading the agency to a ministry . 
Well , Koizumi stated recently that he will temporarily shelve the plan and will not submit it to the Cabinet for deliberation for the time being . 
Well , he hopes that the two ruling parties will carefully discuss this issue and er , continue the discussion . 
Another bit of news is that if you go to Japan , there is a new regulation . 
Japan plans to require the majority of the tourists , visitors visiting Japan , to have their fingerprints and pictures taken . 
This is to prevent dangerous figures from entering Japan and to avoid illegal immigrants . 
Er , therefore , it should be more inconvenient to go to Japan now . 
Well , of course , there is good news in Japan recently . 
Kiko , the wife of Japan 's second prince , is pregnant . 
The pregnancy has led to the hope of many Japanese that she will give birth to a son to inherit the throne . 
However , she has also stirred up some waves in the imperial family , which has been relatively quiet . 
Er , in fact , Kiko is definitely an older pregnant woman . Moreover , people had always believed that she was happy with a four - person household . 
For her to get pregnant again at such an age , many people cannot help but to speculate that , er , a fight for the throne between the two brothers may be unfolding in the imperial family . 
Of course , many people take delight in talking about this conspiracy theory . 
They claim that this incident may be traced back to a few years ago . 
Er , this is how it goes . It was in 2002 when the wife of the eldest Prince Naruhito was diagnosed with depression . As a result , the imperial family did not invest too much hope in them , and pressured the second eldest Prince Akishino in turn . 
Akishino did not have too much of a response at the time . 
However , in 2004 , the conflict was intensified because Naruhito , er , was eager to protect his wife and um , criticized the imperial family in public . 
Well , allegedly , the imperial family was furious at that time and requested the second - eldest Prince Akishino , who is of the same generation as Naruhito , to come forward to refute his brother , saying that his doting on his wife was a disrespect to the imperial family . 
Since then , the brothers have been at odds . 
Now , if the second - eldest Prince Akishino has a boy , well , then their spindle will become a pillar of the imperial family , 
while the crown prince , who is also the eldest prince , will thus decline for sure . 
Er , therefore , many people say that it will have a great impact on the imperial family and Japanese society . 
Annan , the UN Secretary - General , met with US President Bush on Monday at the White House . 
In regard to Iran 's announcement of postponing its nuclear negotiations with Russia , Annan urged Iran to stop its nuclear activities as soon as possible and to resolve the issue through negotiations and not resistance . 
Moreover , there is news that the US Department of Defense has begun to work closely on the plan to bomb Iran as a last resort if diplomatic efforts fail . 
Initially , the outside believed that Bush and Annan would discuss the possibility of the UN Security Council imposing sanctions on Iran , but the two did not make public the discussions in this area after the meeting . 
Both Bush and Annan reiterated that they hoped to resolve Iran 's nuclear issue through talks . 
Annan expressed his worries over Iran 's launching of enriched uranium activities and its decision to postpone the nuclear talks with Russia . 
On the same day , the US media reported that military strategists at the Pentagon have begun to work closely on the plan to take military actions against Iran in case diplomatic efforts fail and the United States uses military means to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons . 
According to the report , commanders at the US Central Command have started ascertaining the targets of attack . 
The attack may be by means of the launch of ballistic missiles from submarines and air raids from B2 bombers . 
Annan appealed Monday for all parties to refrain from taking actions that will escalate the crisis . 
Military specialists analyzed that Iran may be capable of producing nuclear weapons in two years . 
Bush has more than two years remaining in his second term . 
He will strive to resolve Iran 's nuclear issue during his term of office , whether it is through peaceful or military means . 
Mou Naiqian , Phoenix TV , Washington . 
Iranian President Ahmadinejad stated on the 13th that superpowers that use their own weapons to threaten other nations will soon disappear . 
Ahmadinejad met with diplomatic envoys from other countries in Tehran at the commemoration of the 27th Anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution . 
He indicated that the arms race and the fight for supremacy among nations will not produce any result . 
The superpowers ' appetite will never be satisfied . They even use weapons to threaten other nations . 
However , he claimed that superpowers that rely on weapons to threaten other nations will soon disappear . 
The day when mankind can enjoy eternal peace and stability will soon arrive . 
Thus , we can see that it is not only a fight of words ; in fact , the increasingly explosive situation between Iran and the Western world , with the United States , is becoming more intense . 
Due to the mutually unyielding positions between Iran and the United States , some recent changes have appeared in which Iran officially announced the resumption of its enriched uranium refining program two days ago . 
In fact , some Western diplomats have speculated that Iran might have actually resumed some enriched uranium refining procedures before that . 
In addition , Iran announced that it will postpone the talks with Russia indefinitely , the negotiations on Russia refining enriched uranium for Iran . 
Well , of course , the indefinite postponement of the negotiation plan is decided under the new development of the situation . 
Recently , due to the continuous threat of the United States to attack Iran , a British think - tank - the Oxford Research Institute - has issued such a report . 
If the United States resorts to force , half the people will die . Moreover , it will definitely touch off um , continue the wave of violence in the Middle East this year . 
In addition , some terrorist attacks will be intensified . 
Of course , oil prices will skyrocket ; which is also among the series of domino effects . 
The report also stated that if the United States fails to force Iran into compliance , it will definitely accelerate Iran 's determination to produce nuclear weapons by itself . 
We just mentioned the Russia - Iran negotiation issue . 
The Iranian official spokesman indeed stated on Monday that due to the emergence of the new situation , it will postpone the negotiations with Russian officials on the refining of enriched uranium in Russia originally scheduled for the 16th . 
A spokesman for Russia 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it had not received any formal notification from the Iranian authorities . 
It is still too early to tell if the meeting will continue . 
Moreover , Yusufov , Minister of Atomic Energy for the Russian Federation and Minister of Energy for Russia , stated on Monday that Russia is prepared for talks with Iran to discuss the conditions and principles of the nuclear issue . 
Meanwhile , the New York Times based in the United States recently issued an editorial . 
The headline of the editorial was also very conspicuous . It was titled ' Japan 's Offensive Foreign Minister . ' 
The editorial specifically mentioned that Japan 's Foreign Minister Taro Aso had made a string of appalling remarks recently . 
These statements were all very dishonest and unwise . Moreover , they had provoked a general rage in Asian countries . 
The editorial particularly mentioned that Japan should acknowledge and learn from its own mistakes , instead of avoiding to mention what it did during the Second World War in its teaching materials after the war , as it is currently doing . 
At the same time , the editorial also claimed that many of Taro Aso 's statements , such as requesting the Prime Minister to visit the Yasukuni Shrine , and that Taiwan 's colonial rule had heightened um , oh , Japan 's colonial rule had heightened the um , educational standard in Taiwan , remarks like these were appalling . Moreover , it was obvious that he lacks knowledge of history and has poor diplomatic sense . 
The New York Times was the third - largest circulated newspaper in the United States last year , so it should be very influential in US society . 
Thus , this editorial should create a huge impact . 
Meanwhile , um , former senior US government officials and experts specialized in Asian issues in the United States recently held a special symposium - a symposium on the Sino - Japanese relations . 
Some experts put forward this argument at the symposium . 
They said that the Sino - Japanese relation is very tense right now , with the potential danger of a military clash . 
Moreover , they even claimed that the possibility of an outbreak of a um , military clash between China and Japan is even higher than one between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits . 
Er , once a military clash breaks out , the United States will be dragged into the mire because it will definitely be drawn into it . 
A spokesman for Japan 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs , who participated in the symposium , said that the Sino - Japanese relation is currently at a very tense stage . 
Any mistake will lead to serious consequences . 
In addition , the Parliamentary Committees on Defense and Security of the Georgian Parliament held an enlarged session and decided to drive out Russian peacekeeping troops in the South Ossetia area . 
The Russian Parliament will hold a general assembly today to deliberate on this motion . 
Er , experts argued that if the Parliament carries the motion to expel the Russian peacekeeping troops , it will lead to a fundamental rupture of the Georgian - Russian relationship . 
A spokesman for the Russian peacekeeping troops stated on the 14th that two Russian peacekeeping troops food transport vehicles were blocked by the Georgian police , and the drivers were driven away . 
Er , the spokesman demanded Georgia to stop such provocations immediately ; otherwise , Russia will not be responsible for the consequences . 
Two provisions and non - staple food military vehicles under the Russian peacekeeping troops logistics system were interrogated by the Georgian police in the South Ossetia area on Monday night . 
The Georgian police officers on duty expelled the Russian drivers , and the escort personnel then drove the two military vehicles away by force . 
The incident had infuriated the Russian peacekeeping troops . 
A spokesman for the Russian peacekeeping troops said that the Georgian police used a traffic accident as an excuse to detain a Russian military vehicle on February 1 , and has not returned it so far . 
On February 8 , they held three Russian officers in custody for two days and two nights on the pretext of a visa issue . 
The ruthless provocations of Georgia is in hopes that it will create bloodshed in this area and force the Russian troops to open fire , so that it can achieve the aim of making the peacekeeping troops withdraw from South Ossetia . 
The Russian embassy in Georgia lodged serious statements with Georgia on that day , demanding that Georgia stop its desperate provocations immediately . Otherwise , Russia will not bear the responsibilities of any clashes resulting from it . 
The media indicated that on February 13 , Okruashvili , Georgia 's Minister of Defense , announced that leaders at the Russian military base in Akhalkalaki had sold several ' STRELA - type ' missiles for use with self - propelled anti - aircraft missile systems to South Ossetia . 
The Parliamentary Committees on Defense and Security of the Georgian Parliament held an enlarged session on that day to listen to reports from law enforcement departments , and decided to expel the Russian peacekeeping troops in Georgia , and requested the parliamentary assembly scheduled on the 14th to deliberate on this issue . 
Experts believe that once the final decision is made , it may lead to the final fundamental breakdown of the Georgian - Russian relationship . 
Earlier , Georgian Foreign Minister Bezhuashvili fiercely criticized Russia 's position , refuting Russian President Putin 's statement that if the West recognizes Kosovo , then Russia may recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia , arguing that Russia is sending encouraging signals to all the separatist regions . 
Russia 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also declared earlier that it will protect the Russian citizens in South Ossetia , which implied the threat of direct force toward Georgia . 
Lu Yuguang , Phoenix TV , Moscow . 
Roughead , Commander - in - Chief of the U.S . Pacific fleet , announced Tuesday that the United States will dispatch four aircraft carriers to conduct the largest military exercise in 10 years in the Asian - Pacific region this summer . 
Roughead added that the United States will not er , consider China as a threat . 
The U.S . army hopes to conduct another joint military exercise with the Chinese People 's Liberation Army . 
The declaration immediately raised concern among U.S . defense experts . 
The Heritage Foundation held a seminar Wednesday on the Pentagon 's defense evaluation report . 
The subtle relations between the defense report and the military exercise had become one of the discussion topics . 
Some people argued that Roughead 's open invitation for China to participate in the military exercise is a friendly gesture by the United States toward China . 
While extending its invitation to China for its participation in a military exercise , the U.S . army also indicated its hope for more transparent operations by the Chinese People 's Liberation Army . Thus , some defense experts argued that it is a sign that the Pentagon cannot fathom China 's intentions in expanding its military power , and hopes to learn about the real situation and feel each other out through a joint military exercise . 
Moreover , since the defense evaluation report released by the Pentagon at the beginning of the month had considered China as the biggest potential threat in the future , thus , two defense experts also pointed out that the Asian - Pacific military exercise will be the first step for the U.S . Department of Defense to adjust its strategy on this basis . 
Xie Xiaoshuang , Phoenix TV , Washington . 
In addition , the wide attention given to this um , summertime military exercise by the United States is also because this will be the first time in 10 years that the United States has four um , aircraft carriers participating in a military exercise together . It is also the first time since the Vietnam War that the United States has dispatched the aircraft carrier on the East Coast to take part in such a military exercise in the um , Western Pacific region . 
Well , the military exercises will indeed be very frequent . There will be four exercises within a few months . 
Er , one of them will also be a multi - nation military exercise . 
Well , the multi - nation military exercise will include Japan , Korea , and Australia . 
Now , let 's look at today 's headlines .

Moreover , Hu Jintao expressed his heartfelt condolences to the victims , and extended his sincere concern for the victims ' families . 
Good . We will get in touch with Chen Yiming , a reporter for the People 's Daily in Islamabad , immediately on the issue and check with him on the most updated information . 
Hello Mr. Chen . 
Would you please brief us on the newest development in the investigation into the gunning down of the Chinese engineers ? 
Er , sure , anchor . 
Er , according to the information I gathered from the Chinese Consulate General in Karachi , um , er , the Chinese , um , consulate has already notified the victims ' work unit about the unfortunate incident . 
Well , according to common practice , well , um , the aftermath of the victims should be discussed between the victims ' work unit and er , the families , er , before the final decision is made . 
In addition , Pakistan 's um , Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement yesterday . 
It , er , the statement stated that the people responsible for the incident , er , attempted to sow dissension between China and Pakistan . 
Er , the statement claimed that it will conduct a thorough investigation into the incident and er , will , er , er , strengthen the security protection for all , er , Chinese working in Pakistan , and that er , Pakistan will do its utmost to prevent similar incidents from happening again . 
Er , besides , according to the nightly report of the er , privately - run GEO in Pakistan , Bashir , the Chief Executive Officer of Attock Cement Factory in Pakistan , said during an interview with the station that night that after the attack , Pakistan will arrange well , for the return of the remaining 11 Chinese engineers working on this cement project to China as soon as possible . 
Bashir also said in the interview that some Pakistani media questioned why er , the Chinese engineers were not accompanied by security officers , er , when the incident happened . Er , he said that er , in fact , the cement factory that the engineers er , worked for has its own security protection system . However , since the accident happened within the factory compound , thus no security officers were accompanying them when the accident happened . 
Well , he er , expressed deep regret over this unfortunate incident . 
Anchor . 
Yes , good . 
Er , moreover , this was indeed not the first time that Chinese engineers have been murdered in Pakistan . 
Such an incident happened in October 2004 . 
Two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by a militant group in South Waziristan . 
Eventually , one of the people was unfortunately killed during the rescue effort . 
Moreover , in May of the same year , three engineers were killed by a bomb in Gwadar . 
Let us review the incidents . 
On May 3, 2004 , at the Gwadar port south of the Balochistan province , Pakistan , a vehicle carrying 12 Chinese was attacked by a car bomb on its way to the work site at the port . 
Three Chinese engineers were killed and nine others were injured in the end . 
The attack was believed to have been launched by local separatists and tribal insurgents . 
On October 9 of the same year , two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by insurgents in the South Waziristan district at the Pakistan - Afghanistan border . 
An engineer was unfortunately shot to death when the Pakistani troops later rescued the hostages . 
However , the kidnapping was believed to have been orchestrated by a militant group linked to al - Qaeda , and not by separatist insurgents . 
Due to the frequent economic contacts between China and Pakistan , many Chinese engineers take part in Pakistani infrastructure projects and work in the local areas . 
Tribal insurgents in Pakistan also accuse the government of seizing their natural resources . 
As a result , Chinese have fallen victim to several attacks and kidnaps . 
This is a news roundup by Phoenix TV . 
Let 's look at a few Japanese news items . 
There is a rather shocking piece of news in Japanese politics recently . 
Tsuneo Watanabe , President of The Yomiuri Shimbun , a leading outlet in Japan 's media , instructed The Yomiuri Shimbun to publish um , articles criticizing Koizumi 's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine . Since then , The Yomiuri Shimbun has held the same position on the matter . 
Er , well , um , Tsuneo Watanabe railed against Koizumi in um , his speech a few days ago , calling him very ignorant , and that he does not know any history or culture . 
He also equated the visitation of the Yasukuni Shrine to the glorification of Hitler . He added that such an act by Koizumi has made China and Korea consider Japan as an extremely dangerous nation , which will cause endless trouble . 
Why would Tsuneo Watanabe 's position create huge shock waves ? 
In fact , he is very influential in politics and has always been a hidden hand . 
He had been a far rightist in the past . 
He had supported the hawks and aggressively promoted the revision of the Constitution . 
However , it is a um , huge turn now . 
He has turned the cannon around to start bombing Koizumi and opposing such a position . 
Actually , in 2004 when people criticized Koizumi for visiting the Yasukuni Shrine , um , Tsuneo Watanabe still claimed that , he claimed that he supported Koizumi , and asked him to stand up to the pressure . 
Nonetheless , he made a speech recently saying , " I 'll be 80 years old this year . I have very little time left . " 
Well , now he comes forward and makes anti - war speeches in a lofty tone . 
His change in um , allegiance no doubt creates a huge impact on Japanese , um society . 
As Tsuneo Watanabe put it himself , " I believe I have the confidence and the ability to change the political situation . " 
He added that if the government exerts pressure on the freedom of speech and assembly and the editorial freedom of The Yomiuri Shimbun , he would risk his life to resist . 
Then , what kind of situation has been formed now ? 
Japan 's largest newspaper , The Yomiuri Shimbun , and its second largest newspaper , um , the % pw Asahi Shimbun , the two major newspapers have joined hands in opposing Koizumi 's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine . 
Originally , the two major newspapers were two opposing groups . However , after the two presidents met , at least they had reached a consensus on this matter . 
Thus , they both adopt strong offensives in um , railing against Koizumi . It can be said that they have formed a dream team . 
In fact , these two major newspapers have huge , um , influence on the mainstream public opinion in Japan . 
Moreover , let us look at the meeting of the um , House of Representatives in Japan . In a recent meeting , the same remark was made by the top two successor candidates um , of um , Japan 's Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi . 
Who were these two people ? 
% pw one was Shinzo Abe , Chief Cabinet Secretary , and the other was Taro Aso , Japan 's Foreign Minister , who has repeatedly made um , shocking remarks in recent days . 
What remark did both of them make ? 
They both said that Japan 's war criminals of the Second World War were not criminals . 
What they meant was that er , it was the international court that called them um , criminals and convicted them . 
While in Japan , according to international laws , according to Japanese laws , er , the war criminals had not broken any Japanese laws . 
Thus , they argued that war criminals of the Second World War should not be considered as criminals in Japan . 
In the meantime , um , Shinzo Abe mentioned that Japan should now have the whole world in view and develop its relationship with the United States and business and trading ties with um , East Asian countries . Moreover , it should develop close ties with India instead of focusing on China all the time . 
China 's New Electronic Banking Business Management Regulations will be Implemented on March 1 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , February 6 ( reporter : Han Jie and Xu Bo ) Reporters learned from China 's Banking Supervision Committee on the 6th that the " Electronic Banking Business Management Method " and the " Guidance on Electronic Banks Security Assessment " issued by the Banking Supervision Committee in recent days will be implemented on March 1, 2006 . 
A spokesman for the Banking Supervision Committee said that based on the management method regulations , the approval method for foreign financial institutions is unchanged , i.e . if a branch of a foreign bank is approved to establish an online banking business and it needs to add a new service item for the online banking business , the major unit that reports to the branch in China 's territory should be solely responsible for the application and review . 
To normalize banking business development of commercial banks that use the Internet , the Chinese People 's Bank has made and issued the " Temporary Method for Management of Online Banking Businesses " in June, 2001 . 
The spokesman for the Banking Supervision Committee said that with the continuous development of electronic banking business at commercial banks , the Temporary Method cannot meet the requirements for electronic banking risk control anymore . Thus , the Banking Supervision Committee has made two new regulations . 
As the spokesman for the Banking Supervision Committee introduced , the acknowledgement of the Banking Supervision Committee on qualification of a security assessment setup is different from industrial admission or administrative approval for admission qualification for enterprises , and it is not a necessary condition for an assessment setup to conduct its security assessment business for electronic banking , and it is only a reference when financial institutions select an assessment 
As long as a security assessment setup follows related conditions and requirements , even if it is not acknowledged by the Banking Supervision Committee for its qualification , financial institutions can still invite it to conduct an assessment for electronic banking security , but it should be controlled according to related regulations . 
The " Method for Management of Electronic Banking Businesses " has a total of nine chapters and 99 articles that are divided into nine parts , including the General Principle , Application and Renewal , Risk Control , Data Exchange and Transfer Control , Business Contract Control , Cross - Border Business Activities Control , Supervision Control , Liabilities , and Additional Regulations , etc. 
The " Guidance on Electronic Banks Security Assessment " has a total of five chapters and 57 articles that are divided into five parts , including the General Principle , Security Assessment Setup , Implementation of Security Assessment , Management of Security Assessment Activities , and Additional Regulations , etc. 
Publication of On Investigations and Studies by Mao Zedong , Zhou Enlai , Liu Shaoqi , Zhu De , Deng Xiaoping , and Chen Yun 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , February 6 . The book On Investigations and Studies by Mao Zedong , Zhou Enlai , Liu Shaoqi , Zhu De , Deng Xiaoping , and Chen Yun , compiled by the Document Studies Office of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party , has been published in recent days by the Document Studies Office of the Central Committee . 
Conducting deep investigations and studies on reality , sticking to integration between theory and reality , and making and implementing correct guidelines and policies are the essential experiences and working methods of the Chinese Communist Party that lead revolutions , constructions , and reforms . 
The old generation of revolutionaries , including Mao Zedong , Zhou Enlai , Liu Shaoqi , Zhu De , Deng Xiaoping , and Chen Yun , used to publish many important and brilliant discussion documents on the issues of investigations and studies . They also often went to grass - root units , conducted social investigations themselves , and wrote many investigative reports . 
The practices and accomplishments of their investigations and studies have played important roles in guiding developments of the Party 's and people 's cause along a correct path . 
The book On Investigations and Studies by Mao Zedong , Zhou Enlai , Liu Shaoqi , Zhu De , Deng Xiaoping , and Chen Yun is divided into three parts : the first part includes selected and compiled comments and words of the old generation of revolutionaries , including Mao Zedong , on investigations and studies ; the second part contains selected articles by Mao Zedong and the old generation of revolutionaries on investigations and studies ; the third part involves those investigative reports w 
Most of the investigative reports are being published for the first time . 
In addition , there are two attached summaries about the investigations and studies done by leaders of the Central Committee of the Party in the 50s and 60s of the last century . 
Russia Reiterates Sticking to Its One - China Position 
Xinhua News Agency , Moscow , February 6 . Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Losyukov reiterated that Russia is sticking to its One - China policy when he met with Liu Guchang , the Chinese ambassador to Russia , on the 6th .

Aleksandr Losyukov said that the Russian Foreign Ministry will publish a statement as soon as possible to reiterate its One - China position and oppose " Taiwan Independence . " 
( Overseas Affairs about China ) Third Chinese Countryman Robbed and Killed within Two Days in South Africa 
Xinhua News Agency , Johannesburg , February 6 ( reporter : Chen Ming ) Lin Yixing , an overseas Chinese from Fuqing , Fujian Province , China , was wounded when he was running his bar , and was robbed by local gunmen in the early morning of February 5 , South African local time . He died after unsuccessful emergency treatment at a hospital in Bloemfontein , the judicial capital of South Africa , in the early morning of the 6th . 
As Feng Yang , the President of the Overseas Chinese Association of Freedom State Province , said , the incident occurred at a bar in Welkom , more that 130 kilometers northwest of Bloemfontein . 
While Lin Yixing , the bar owner , was cleaning items under the bar counter and preparing to end that day 's business , 
there were still three customers at the bar at that time . One of them pulled out a pistol and rushed behind the bar to rob him . 
Lin Yixing , who was more than 40 years old , wrestled with those robbers . They shot Ling Yixing one time , and then fled . 
Locals rushed to the scene after they heard the news , and sent Lin Yixing to the hospital for emergency treatment . Since Lin Yixing 's body had " symptoms of diffuse capillary bleeding , " and the bleeding could not be stopped , Lin died around 3:30 a.m. in the early morning of February 6 . 
Xu Defu and Wu Gang , the two consuls from China 's General Consulate in Johannesburg , and Lin Changming , the Vice President of China 's Fujian Townsmen Association in South Africa , drove to Bloemfontein on February 6 , and assisted family members of the dead with handling the subsequent affairs . 
Lin Yixing becomes the third Chinese to be killed by a robber 's gunshot within 36 hours , and the fourth Chinese to have died in South Africa this year . 
( Newspaper Digest ) Part - Time Workers and High School Graduates Become Major Forces of Hourly - Paid Work in Shanghai 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , February 7 . The " Guidance on the Current Standard for Hourly - Paid Wages in 2006 " issued by the Labor and Social Support Bureau of Shanghai City on February 6 , lists 120 occupations , which is 11 more than the number issued last time . The " wage levels " of the original positions are either increased or reduced . 
As an estimate made by related experts of the Labor and Social Support Bureau of Shanghai City , currently the hourly - paid workers in Shanghai are more than one million . 
As China Youth Journal reported , part - time workers and high school graduates are the major part of the team of hourly - paid labors . 
Through a direct survey of more than 8,000 hourly - paid workers , more than half of them are part - time workers , and their ratio is 51.1 % . 
Those part - time workers are generally well educated , and mainly do more technical work . For instance , the ratio of part - time workers in the translation occupation is as high as 81.7 % , and that in the gym business is 61.6 % . 
High income is one of the important reasons for many people to work at hourly - paid part - time jobs . 
As was learned , monthly income for some positions can reach up to several tens of thousands of Yuan , and it is difficult to find high - demand talents , such as simultaneous interpreters ; most hourly - paid workers ' monthly incomes can reach more than 2,000 Yuan , such as part - time financial workers , wedding ceremony managers , etc. 
One of the important reasons for the popularity of part - time workers for hourly wages is that those jobs suit individual interests and workers can learn more knowledge from those jobs . 
For instance , Mr. Gu , who is a manager of the Human Resources Unit at a company , uses several hours to handle business accounts for a foreign business agency every week . 
Mr. Gu thinks that the greatest benefit of a part - time job is to continuously renew his own knowledge , and has opportunities to know another field , and of course , a monthly income of 2,000 Yuan is also attractive to a certain extent . 
Since some positions for hourly - paid workers are low - skill ones , and their working patterns are flexible and free , they have gradually become popular among a lot of graduates who are looking for jobs . 14 % of hourly - paid workers are graduates from colleges and polytechnic schools in the last three years . 
" I did not want to do an hourly - paid job in the beginning . But several months later , I feel it is better than 9 to 5 work . " 
Xiao Huang 's job hunting is not that satisfying after he graduates from college . He eventually registers with a hotel and plays background music on a piano . 
" I am quite satisfied with my current work , 100 yuan per hour , and the environment is also good . What I should do now is to find several more hourly - paid jobs . " 
As has been learned , hourly - paid jobs have become an important path for those graduates who are looking for jobs to accumulate work experience , exercise their work skills , improve their communication skills , and enrich their social experience . 
Those graduates who work at hourly - paid jobs are mainly concentrated in positions that require more knowledge and skills , including translation positions , which require professional skills , and entertainment and performance positions , which require current popularity . These two kinds of positions are 22.1 % and 26.8 % , respectively , among those jobs that require more knowledge and skills . 
Some positions for hourly - paid workers do not require high skills , such as food promotion workers , merchandise handlers , and unemployed workers who are able to work through simple trainings . 
Data shows that those hourly - paid workers who used to be unemployed are 39 % of the total hourly - paid workers ; among them , workers who used to work in retail business are 68.4 % ; and those in restaurants and food businesses are 58.7 % . The hourly - paid jobs have become an important channel for unemployed workers to find their employment . 
Wu Bangguo Investigated Work in Anhui 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , February 8 ( reporters : Zou Shengwen and Zhou Limin ) . Wu Bangguo , member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party , and President of the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress , stressed when he investigated work in Anhui in recent days , that we should be guided by the important ideology of the " three represents , " stick to using a concept of scientific development to guide the whole situation of econom 
Wu Bangguo visited Ma 'anshan , Wuhu , Hefei , etc. , successively from February 6 to 8 , and went into businesses , rural areas , scientific research institutes , and colleges and universities for investigations . 
Wu Bangguo pointed out that Anhui has an advantageous position that links the eastern and western , southern and northern regions , and is an important agricultural area , and that it has rich natural resources , a better industrial foundation , stronger scientific and educational strengths , unique cultural and tourist resources , and great developmental potential . 
Anhui should tightly grasp the important opportunity for promoting the rise of the Middle Region , consistently stick to focusing on economic development and never shift the focus , carefully carry out guidelines and policies of the central government while closely integrating them with Anhui 's reality , creatively do its work , and implement a concept of scientific development in its concrete measures and actual work . 
It should promptly sum up practical experience , fully rely on the masses of people , vigorously support reforms and innovations , and continuously create new working development in Anhui . 
It should actively promote construction of a harmonious society , stick to the policy for further realizing , maintaining , and developing the essential interests of the masses of people as the starting point and goal of its entire work , and actively create conditions to gradually overcome difficulties for the masses , and solve actual problems for them , and gradually adjust allocation relations , change the dual structure between urban and rural areas , gradually reduce regional gaps , m 
Wu Bangguo stressed that China has entered the historical phase in which she must rely more on strengthening her self - innovative capability and promoting labor qualities to advance economic and social developments , and that only if scientific and technological progress and innovations are vigorously advanced can quality of productivity be greatly improved , and economic and social developments actually be turned to a path of scientific development . 
It should establish and perfect systems and mechanisms that are good for innovations as soon as possible , enhance science and technology investment , encourage patents and inventions , develop well - known brands , accelerate the transformation from scientific and technological accomplishments to realization of productivity , strengthen enterprises ' autonomy in their own innovations , and continuously promote the contribution rate of scientific and technological developments in economic g 
It should support and encourage technological elements participating in allocation , establish and perfect a statistical index system that demonstrates self - innovative capability , study and make policies in aspects of finance , tax , and government procurement for the support of self - innovations , and form a policy system to encourage self - innovations . 
It should cultivate innovative awareness in the entire society , vigorously advocate an innovative and competitive spirit , and focus on creating a good atmosphere for cultivation of talents . 
Wu Bangguo pointed out that the People 's Congress is playing more important roles in the process of administration of the nation with laws and construction of the socialist country with legal systems . 
For the People 's Congress to do a good job in the new situation , the first thing should be to stick to a correct political direction , firmly walk on the developmental path of socialist politics with Chinese features , and organically integrate staying with the leadership of the Party , people being in charge , and governing the country according to laws . 
The second thing should be to focus on the major work of the party and state , important issues in reforms and developments , and working on hot and difficult issues that the masses of people care about , and continuously strengthen the efficiency of the work of the People 's Congress . 
The third thing should be to fully take advantage of the features and superiority of work in the People ' s Congress , stick to the democratic centralization system , do things strictly by law and procedure , and make collective decisions . 
It should stick to following the mainstream , regarding peoples ' needs as a priority , using power for people , sensing peoples ' needs , and bringing benefits to people . 
China Comes Up With an " Important Science and Research Plan " for Future 15 Years 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , February 9 ( reporter : Li Xing ) To promote China 's international competitive capacity , vigorously advance sustainable development , and realize a prioritized plan for surpassing ( developed countries ) , the " Outline Plan for the State 's Medium - and Long - Term Scientific and Technological Development ( 2006 to 2020 ) , " issued by the State Council on the 9th , has arranged four important plans for scientific studies . 
The four important scientific plans include protein studies , quantum adjustment and control studies , nano - studies , and growth and reproduction studies . 
The outline points out that protein science is the peak of life science that developed countries are fiercely competing for . 
In the next 15 years , China should focus on studying transcription repression histochemistry , protein histochemistry , metabolic histochemistry , structural biology , functions and interactions of protein biology , biology and systematic biology regarding protein calculation , methodology of protein studies and related application and basic studies , etc. 
At the same time , the outline thinks that quantum adjustment and control studies has an obvious forward - looking nature , and might significantly impact the economic development of human society to an extent that can hardly be assessed in 20 to 30 years . 
China should focus on studying the carrier , adjustment , and control rationales and methods of quantum communication , quantum calculation , the new quantum effect of constrained small quantum systems , quantum adjustment and control demonstration , and a new rationale and technical basis for quantum measurement , etc. 
Moreover , the outline points out that nano - technology has become the strategic selection for many countries to promote their core competitive capacity , and also is one of the fields for China to realize its surpassing development . 
In the next 15 years , China will focus on studying in this field , including controllable equipment , self - assembly , and functionalization of nano - material , nano - electronics , nano - biology , nano - medicine , nano - size demonstration and metrology , and applications of nano - material and technology in fields such as energy , the environment , information , medicine , etc. 
Since China 's population is growing on a large scale , there are many birth defects , a serious shortage of organs for transplants , and the aging peak is coming , it urgently needs to make breakthroughs and technological innovations in the scientific theories on reproduction and development . 
Based on the outline , from 2006 to 2020 , China will focus on studying stem cell reproduction , differentiation , adjustment , and control ; production , maturity , and fertilization of reproductive cells ; the mechanism of declination and degenerative pathological changes in human reproductive functions ; and the safety and ethics of assisting reproduction of stem cells , and stem cell technology , etc.

( Overseas Affairs about China ) Overseas Chinese and Chinese People in Argentina Strongly Denounce the Speech Made By Chen Shui - bian about " Taiwan Independence " 
Xinhua News Agency , Buenos Aires , February 8 ( reporter : Cao Yu ) The Argentine China Peaceful Unification Promotion Association , established by overseas Chinese and Chinese people who live in Argentina , published a serious statement on the 8th strongly condemning a recent speech made by Chen Shui - bian about " Taiwan Independence " and opposing any schemes that attempt to split Taiwan from China .

China 's Experts : " China 's Military Threat " Touted by the United States Is an Unreasonable Accusation . 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , February 9 ( reporters : Li Xuanliang , Xiong Zhengyan , Lin Liping ) . The Quadrennial Defense Review formally submitted by the United States Pentagon to the Congress a few days ago first calls China " a newly arisen power that is most likely to challenge the United States militarily . " 
Experts think that this is an unreasonable accusation against China 's normal defense construction , and an interference in China 's internal affairs by exaggerating the " theory of China 's military threat . " 
The Quadrennial Defense Review is a new guidance document for national defense of the Pentagon . 
This 92 - page report uses three paragraphs to discuss the issue of China 's military strength and how the United States should cope with it . The report directly mentions the two terms of " China " and " Chinese " 15 times , and says that , " As a major newly arisen power , China has the most military potential to compete with the United States ; if the United States does not take any countermeasures , China is very likely to develop destructive military technology , and break the US supremacy o 
Yao Yunzhu , a research fellow at the World 's Military Study Office of China 's Military Science Academy , said that although senior US officials expressed similar views before , this is the first time for the United States to come up with the idea that " China is most likely to challenge the United States militarily as a newly arisen power " in a Defense Strategy Report . 
" This report first regards Russia , India , and China as newly arisen strategic rivals , and especially , pays more attention to the so - called 'theory of China 's military threat , ' " 
said Major General Peng Guangqian , a research fellow at China 's Military Science Academy . 
The noticeable thing is that on the same day when The Quadrennial Defense Review was submitted , US President Bush also presented his administrative budget for the 2007 fiscal year to the Congress , and the defense budget is as high as 439.3 billion dollars in the budget . 
" If the budget for military activities in Iraq and Afghanistan is added , the defense budget for the US in the 2007 fiscal year will break the historical record of 500 billion dollars , " said Peng Guangqian . " And this almost amounts to the sum of military expenses of all the countries in the world . " 
Peng Guangqian thinks that the US method of making " theories of threats from other countries " reflects its consistent style of " making enemies , " and its real goal is to strive for more defense funds and fish for more profits for the US 's gigantic defense industry groups . 
Experts said that compared with the large military expenses of the US , China 's military expenditure is quite limited . 
Deng Hongzhou , a military expert who has participated in the writing of the China Defense White Paper many times , said that since the 90s of the 20th century , with the economic development , China 's defense funding has been increased to some extent , but it tends to fall in its ratio to the state 's financial expenditure in the same periods . 
Official data shows that comparing 2004 with 1979 , the ratio of China 's defense expenditure in the state 's financial expenditure was decreased nearly 10 percentage points . 
China 's defense funding in 2005 was RMB 244.656 billion Yuan , which only amounts to 1/14 of that of the US ; military expense per capita is only equal to 1/60 of that of the US ; and military expense per serviceman is about only 1/30 of that of the US Armed Forces . 
" The US land area is about as big as China 's , but the gap in military expenditures between ( the two countries ) is so huge that there is no need to point out whose military strength indeed exceeds the needs of a justifiable defense , " 
said Peng Guangqian . 
Teng Jianqun , Director of the Study Office at China 's Armament Control and Disarmament Association , said that the US side should objectively comment on China 's military construction , and China 's peaceful development does not mean that China and the United States will become military rivals in the future . 
China 's Defense White Paper 2004 says that China firmly follows the path of peaceful development and implements a defensive policy of national defense . 
China never threatened or threatens or will threaten any countries . 
China has never established any military bases in any other countries so far , nor sent any troops to other countries ; but the United States has established more than a hundred overseas military bases , and deployed more than 100,000 troops in the Asian region alone . 
Zhu Feng , a professor at the International Relations College of Beijing University , said that both China and the United States should strengthen communications and exchanges through established channels between the two countries to promote understanding and mutual trust , thoroughly advance the constructive collaboration relation between China and the United States in the new century , and jointly develop and maintain peace and development in the world .

( International Observation ) Hamas Seeks Breakthrough in Organization of its Cabinet 
Xinhua News Agency , Ramallah , February 9 ( International Observation ) . Hamas Seeks Breakthrough in Organization of its Cabinet 
Xinhua News Agency reporters : Wang Hao and Huang Min 
How the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) draws the blueprint for its first government after it won the Legislative Committee election has become the focus that the international community is currently paying attention to . 
What kind of a new policy Hamas is going to carry out will directly affect the next appropriate policy direction of every party concerned in the peace process . 
At the same time , the boycott attitude of the United States and Israel has made the prospect of the Hamas government more uncertain . 
Currently , all the parties in Palestine are consulting each other tensely , and actively looking for breakthroughs in difficulties and sensitive aspects in future development of the cabinet organization . 
( subtitle ) Who Will be Selected to Take the Position of Prime Minister ? 
Some outsiders worry that a " Hamas Prime Minister " might have disagreements with Abbas , the current supreme leader , after Hamas wins the right to organize its cabinet . 
Moreover , a Hamas leader , Mushir , who is visiting Egypt , stressed that a new Palestinian government established by Hamas leadership will not acknowledge Israel . This strong signal has also raised more international concerns . 
The United States and Israel have clearly stated that they do not accept a Hamas government that controls real power , and threatened to stop their economic aid to Palestine and suspend transferring tax income to the Palestinian side . 
However , these things do not hinder Hamas from adjusting its strategy flexibly . Selection of an independent candidate is one compromise . 
As it has been reported , to win maximum acknowledgement internationally , the Hamas leaders from home and abroad who gathered in Egypt a few days ago , had decided to select Jamal al - Khudairi , an independent person who is the Chair of the Board of Gaza Islamic University , to be the new Prime Minister . 
This move has not been responded to by related parties . 
Hussein , a Palestinian analyst , said that no matter who is selected as the prime minister , the most important thing is to soften the " strong " attitude of Hamas as much as possible on the selection of the candidate for prime minister , and only in this way can it assure the success of the cabinet organization . 
( Subtitle ) How to Allocate Power 
The biggest challenge for Hamas in organizing its cabinet is that it lacks sufficient administrative experience from the perspective of its internal capabilities . 
An article published by the Palestinian Daily Journal analyzed that although Hamas has won support from people through social welfare items , it lacks administrative experience , and a better strategy is to collaborate with the Palestinian National Liberation Movement ( Fatah ) , which has administrative experience . 
Hamas suggested to establish a " political partnership " with Fatah to organize a national coalition government after the election , but Fatah has not actively responded to it so far . 
Inside Fatah , there are now different opinions on whether it should join the cabinet ; some think it should join the new government to play a role in it ; some refuse the invitation from Hamas and would rather become an " active opposition " in the Legislative Committee . 
A well - informed source pointed out that Fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government after Abbas 's persuasion . 
Even so , Fatah will bargain with Hamas on the allocation of cabinet positions . 
Moreover , another path is to establish a cabinet that is out of the framework of the Legislative Committee and free of partisan leanings . 
As it has been reported , Hamas has also designed a pure technocratic government , but the concrete name list of the government is unknown . 
Because of the attitude of the United States and Israel , a technocratic government is a cabinet organization method that can reduce external pressure . 
According to regulations of the Palestinian " Essential Law , " nomination of the prime minister and the cabinet organization work will be completed within 3 to 5 weeks after a new Legislative Committee assumes office on the 16th of this month . 
( Subtitle ) Where does the Armed Wing go ? 
Another difficult issue for organization of a new government is the weapons in the hands of Hamas . 
The attitude of the United States and Israel is very strong , and they firmly request that Hamas give up violence , and refuse its joining the government with its weapons . 
Hamas leader Mushir stressed on the 9th that the armed resistance is the " strategic choice " of the organization . 
The armed wing issue includes two aspects of weapons ' legitimacy and ownership and control of armed wings . 
Hamas is acknowledged internationally because it becomes the first big party elected in the Legislative Committee through a democratic and free method , and the legitimatized path for its armed wing , the Qassam Brigades , is to integrate it into a security organization for the government . 
Hamas used to suggest integrating military wings of all factions into a " People 's Army " under the Palestinian National Authority , but it has not received broad responses , and has even been criticized by the Palestinian Islamic Organization ( Jihad ) . 
Palestine currently has more than 60,000 personnel in security organizations , and most of them come from the Fatah camp . 
Moreover , Fatah has some armed wings and keeps loose organizational relations with them , such as the " Al - Aqsa Martyr Brigades " and " Fatah Hawks , " etc. 
Hamas , responsible for the cabinet organization , must make an agreement with Abbas on how to control those self - governed armed wings and reasonably allocate security and administrative power . 
As local media reported , Abbas tends to control security and intelligence troops ; organizations such as the police and civilian defense can be administrated by the Internal Affairs Ministry of a new government . 
However , all parties concerned are still consulting each other on this sensitive issue , and have not produced any results . 
China Issues a Polar - Region Exploration Report for the First Time 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , February 10 ( reporter : Li Jianmin ) . The China 's Polar - Region Exploration Report 2005 issued by the State Ocean Bureau of China is the first published one since China started its polar region scientific exploration activities more than 20 years ago . 
The report thoroughly reflects the major developments and accomplishments of China 's scientific exploration activities , exploration logistic support , and scientific studies in the polar regions in 2005 . 
Based on the record of the report , China 's Antarctic Inland Ice Cover Exploration Team successfully climbed to the A area of the peak of the ice mountain where the top of the inland ice cover at the South Pole was above sea level at 22:15 on January 9, 2005 ( Beijing Time ) , and determined that the highest spot of Ice Mountain A was 4,093 meters at 3:15 on January 18 ( Beijing Time ) . 
" On the stage of international polar - region exploration , where competition is becoming increasingly fierce , the Chinese resort to their strong will and fearless spirit , bravely exploring the new field and successfully first climbing the 'highest point of ice cover at the South Pole ' with one move , and making one more dream of mankind come true at the South Pole . " 
Sun Zhihui , the head of the State Ocean Bureau , said : 
The report demonstrates that the 21st Antarctic Exploration Team of China accomplished its tasks completely and returned to Shanghai on March 24, 2005 . The exploration lasted 151 days , and its total voyage was 26,500 nautical miles . 
On November 18 of the same year , China 's 22nd South Pole Exploration Team left Shanghai for Zhongshan Station at the South Pole to conduct scientific exploration activities , and would leave Zhongshan Station and return to Shanghai through Australia before the end of February 2006 . 
Since it is the first time for China to issue the polar - region exploration report , China 's Polar - Region Exploration Report 2005 also traces back and summarizes China 's polar - region exploration efforts , which started in the 80s of the 20th century . 
According to the report , China formally joined the Antarctic Treaty in 1983 , and became a member country of the Antarctic Treaty , and a consulting member country of the Antarctic Treaty , and a member country of those most influential international organizations of South Pole affairs , respectively , including the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research , and the Antarctic Bureau President Council . 
In 1997 , China became a member of the Arctic Science Committee , and won its speaking right and decision - making right in international polar - region affairs . 
The report points out that in more than 20 years , China 's polar - region explorations have been developed from nothing to having something , and advanced continuously into an initial size . A scientific and exploration system for the South and North Poles , including " three stations and one ship , " has been formed , i.e . the Antarctic Great Wall Station established in February 1985 ; Zhongshan Antarctic Station established in February 1989 ; the Arctic Huanghe Station established in July 2 
Based on the statistics in the report , China has organized 22 scientific explorations , 2 scientific explorations in the Arctic by using the " Snow Dragon " ship as a carrier platform in the Arctic , and 2 batches of explorations around the Arctic Huanghe Station by the end of 2005 . There have been more than 3,000 person times of team members nationwide so far who have been in the Antarctic or Arctic to do field explorations . 
" Currently , we are doing investigation work for the feasibility of building the third exploration station in the Antarctic , that is also China 's first inland exploration station in the Antarctic , " 
said Sun Zhihui . 
" Through more than 20 years ' efforts , China 's polar - region exploration cause has played a role in the world 's polar - region explorations . But compared with those major countries of polar - region explorations , there is still a bigger gap ( between China and them ) , and we must catch up with them , " 
he said . 
Sun Zhihui disclosed that China will publish a polar - region exploration report every year in the future .

High - Definition TVs Have Gradually Become Mainstream in United States 
Xinhua News Agency , New York , February 12 ( reporter : Fan Xiaolin ) . As the price of high - definition TV is continuously falling and its market is constantly expanding , US TV broadcasting institutions are also eagerly promoting appropriate high definition TV programs . 
The just - ended US " Super Bowl , " a US type of football game , has become a warm - up competition for US broadcasters to greet the age of high - definition TV . 
As The Financial Times reported a few days ago , the US Congress has recently passed a bill , and regulates that US broadcasters must completely stop broadcasting current analog TV signals and transmit only digital signals by February 17, 2009 . 
This means that the complete digitalization of TV program broadcasts has gotten a clear schedule . 
The universalization of high definition TV depends not only on consumer TV purchases , but also the making of high definition TV programs by production institutions . 
Although digital TV has been mentioned in the past several years , it is still not a reality . 
But a turning point in this issue appeared this year . 
As the US 's Consumer Electronics Association forecasted , the sales amounts of digital TVs will surpass that of traditional TVs in the United States for the first time this year , and 85 % of digital TVs are high definition products . 
Japanese Researchers Have Developed a New Type of Highly Efficient Manmade Kidney 
Xinhua News Agency , Tokyo , February 13 ( reporter : Qian Zheng ) . Researchers at Japan 's Tokai University have developed a type of manmade biological kidney that can not only function the same as a human kidney for catabolism , but can also keep useful substances in the body . Since it is small in size and easy to transplant , it is hopeful that it will bring good news to patients who have kidney disease with the further development of the study . 
As Japan Economic and Industrial News reported a few days ago , the newly developed manmade biological kidney is composed of two parts . One is the " manmade nephron , " which filters metabolites and water in the blood ; the other is the " manmade urinary tubules , " which extract useful substances such as water and amino acids from the original urine and sends them back into the blood . 
Both the " manmade nephron " and " manmade urinary tubules " are made of hollow threads , and the internal walls of the " manmade urinary tubules " are paved with epithelial cells of urinary tubules that have the function of catabolism . 
This type of epithelial cells can treat diseases caused by repeated hemodialysis and decompose the causative substance of " dialysis - related denatured starch " into an amino acid , and send it back into the blood . They can also send those substances necessary for the human body such as glucose , vitamins , and minerals back into the blood again . 
Previous manmade kidneys depended on the osmosis pressure gap of dialysis to filter metabolites , which cannot totally get rid of them , and does not have the function of making amino acids and other substances return into the blood . 
Researchers used goats to do the manmade kidney transplant experiment , and the inner walls of hollow threads of the manmade kidney are lined with epithelial cells from a hog . 
Two weeks later , researchers confirmed that the manmade kidney is able to function . 
They are currently developing the manmade biological kidney using human kidney cells , and are about to do clinical studies after verification of its safety . 
China 's Secure Power Production Still Faces Serious Challenges 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , February 13 ( reporter : An Pei ) . A leader of the State Power Supervision and Control Committee said on the 13th that although the secure power production generally maintained a stable status in 2005 , secure power production still faces serious challenges . 
Vice Chairman of the State Power Supervision and Control Committee Shi Yubo said at the Fifth ( expanded ) Session of the National Secure Power Production Committee that in 2005 China 's secure power production was stable in general , and accomplished the task smoothly for power peak usage in the summertime , realized a secure power supply , actively coped with the strikes of natural disasters , and basically assured the secure and stable operation of power systems , greatly reduced equipm 
But he pointed out that with changes in power supply and demand situations , and that many of the newly established generating sets are put into operation one after another , secure power production will face new challenges . 
These challenges include : regional , seasonal , and time interval power shortages still exist ; power supply and demand situations in some regions are still tense ; since a good mechanism for the price of power and coal has not been formed , supply of power and coal is still quite problematic ; at the same time , the falling power and coal quality problem has not been effectively controlled , and will seriously affect stable operations of generating sets ; some power network structures are 
Shi Yubo said that with the further development of power system reform , many deep - rooted contradictions will be continuously exposed , and how to maintain stability of employee teams and assure a normal production order will be a new issue to face . 
For the secure power production work in 2006 , Shi Yubo said that the basic control secure power production work should be further consolidated ; an emergency control mechanism for power safety should be established and quickly perfected to strengthen responsive capabilities for emergencies ; coordination between power factories and networks should be strengthened ; security of big dams should be assured ; safety control of power facility constructions should be strengthened to reduce o 
It has been learned that based on a new power safety control situation , this year the Power Supervision and Control Committee will revise and perfect the issued Temporary Regulations on Accident Investigation of Power Production , and at the same time will continuously issue and execute additional documents about the safety of the hydraulic power station dam and safety protection of the secondary power system this year . 
In 2005 , the whole of Chinese society used a total power of 2468.9 billion KWh , and increased 13.45 % compared with that of last year . 
Facing the situation in which power supply and demand is still tense , and the unfavorable status of transportation problems with coal , power , and oil , power enterprises have taken effective measures and strengthened equipment control , and prevented the occurrence of large equipment accidents in national power production in all of last year . 
There were 74 power network accidents , which were reduced by 127 compared with those of last year ; equipment accidents were 427 , which were reduced by 132 compared with those of last year . 
Minister of South Africa , in China , Says There Are No " Organized " Criminal Activities against Chinese Citizens in South Africa 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , February 13 ( reporters : Wang Jiangang and Hao Yalin ) . Charge d ' Affaires ad interim and Minister of the South African Embassy in China Vusi Bruce Koloane said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 13th that there are no " organized " criminal activities against Chinese citizens in South Africa . 
He said at the same time that the South African government will make every effort to " strike against all forms of criminal activities . " 
Vusi Bruce Koloane stated that the South African government hopes to " reduce the crime rate to zero , " and wants the life and asset securities of every foreigner who works in South Africa to be fully protected by local laws and citizens . 
Since 2006 , 4 Chinese citizens have been killed , one after another , in South Africa , and the Chinese world has broadly paid attention to it . 
China 's Foreign Ministry has contacted the South African side about the matter , and warned Chinese citizens who are traveling in South Africa to increase their awareness of their security and protection , and to strengthen unity and caring for each other among overseas Chinese , and to collaborate with the police to jointly strike against criminal activities . 
" We express our sincerest sympathy and condolences to family members of those victims . " 
Vusi Bruce Koloane said , " We are sorry for this , and we also want the Chinese people to believe that the South African government is carefully investigating every case related to the Chinese . " 
As the embassy of South Africa presented , the South African police have successfully broken a case in which Chen Jianqing , a woman came from Fujian , China , was killed on February 5 in South Africa , and have arrested a suspect . 
The police are searching for another suspect at present . 
As the South African embassy in China disclosed , the suspect , who is charged with the gun death of a Hong Kong businessman in January of this year , has been arrested by the South African police , and the belongings of the victim have been recovered . 
When talking about the possible impacts of the killings of Chinese citizens , Vusi Bruce Koloane thinks that those incidents will " indeed " impact trade , tourism , and exchanges in other fields between the two countries , and produce negative outcomes . But in the long run , those impacts " should not be big . " 
As Tourist Attache of the South African embassy Nian Beixi presented , the embassy issued more than 2,000 visas for Chinese to go to South Africa in the first 15 days of this year . 
Based on the statistical data of the Chinese government , South Africa had maintained its number one status as China 's biggest trade partner in Africa in 2005 . 
The bilateral trade amount reached 7.27 billion USD , and increased 23 % compared with that of last year . 
However , people in the tourist industry think that the continuous occurrences of killing Chinese citizens in 2004 have apparently affected the number of tourists who visited South Africa . 
Based on the statistics of the Sightseeing Bureau of South Africa , there were 20,331 Chinese tourists who visited South Africa in the first half of 2005 , which were reduced 14.9 % compared with that of last year . 
There are about 200,000 Chinese who live in South Africa at present , and are scattered everywhere in the towns and villages of South Africa . 
Analysts here think that since there are big gaps between the rich and poor in South African society , and a high unemployment rate , guns are spread everywhere , and no death penalty , the crime rate is still high there . 
Because many Chinese do not speak English , and they carry cash with them and put cash in their homes , they become easy targets for criminals to attack them for their assets .

Peking University Sets Up Mourning Hall to Express Condolences over Academician Wang Xuan 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , February 15 ( reporter : Li Jiangtao ) . Through several days of tense arrangements , the mourning hall for Academician Wang Xuan that was set up at the Memorial of the Hundred - Year Anniversary of Peking University was formally opened at 9 a.m. on the morning of the 15th . By noon of that day , several hundred people had come and offered their condolences . 
Before the mourning hall 's opening time , about 8 a.m. that morning , several dozen people had waited in a long line outside the hall 's gate . 
Inside the memorial hall , the reporter saw the dark , horizontal banner with the calligraphy " Express Profound Condolences over Academician Wang Xuan " hanging on the wall of the Memorial of the Hundred - Year Anniversary of Peking University . 
Below the banner , there was a big picture of Wang Xuan that was more than ten square meters in size . Wang was wearing a pair of glasses , smiling with a scholarly air . 
Several cypress trees and several dozen wreaths were put along both sides of the picture . 
An elegiac couplet on a wreath was written like this : " It began in the Qin Dynasty , prospered in the Tang Dynasty , glorified China , and skillfully laid a foundation ; the contemporary Bi Sheng said farewell to the lead age , greeted the electronic one , and drew a blueprint . " 
Low - volume funeral music was mingled in the mourning hall , in a solemn and respectful atmosphere . 
Among groups who came to express their condolences , there were leaders , teachers , students of Peking University , and friends , colleagues , students , neighbors of Academician Wang Xuan , and also , many strangers who did not know him . 
Some of them held fresh flowers in their hands ; some carried flower baskets ; everybody , wearing small white flowers on their chests , slowly walked to the picture of Academician Wang Xuan , and bowed to express their condolences . 
Many could not help but weep warm tears . 
Zhang Wenbin , who was the Director of the State 's Cultural Relic Bureau and an old alumnus of Peking University , told the reporter that , more than ten years ago , when he worked in Henan Province , he invited Professor Wang Xuan to give a report on scientific and technological innovation for cadres of the provincial Party Committee . 
" The conduct and academic studies of Academician Wang Xuan are the model for us to learn . He made important contributions for the country and society , and people will never forget him . " 
Jin Ruilin , a professor at Peking University 's Law School , has been an old friend and neighbor of Wang Xuan for more than 40 years . 
He just left the hospital several days ago , and insisted on coming today to say farewell to his old friend . 
When Mr. Jin wrote his words in the visitors ' book , he could not help but sadden and wipe the tears pouring from his eyes many times with tissues . 
He told the reporter that Professor Wang Xuan lived a very simple life , " when he lived in Tongfu Yuan , he had already been a professor and had accomplished significant achievements . But he still lived in a very small one - level house for many years . 
He later moved to Chengze Yuan , where he had a space of 70 to 80 square meters , and lived there for more than ten years . 
He refused an offer when Peking University provided him a big 140 - square - meter flat in the Academician Building located in Lan Qiying ; he also refused an upper - floor flat provided by Fangzheng Building . 
Mr. Jin recalled and said with deep emotion that when Wang Xuan visited foreign countries , he simply refused to take positions with very good offers provided by foreign institutions . 
" He insisted on not applying for the title of Academician at the beginning ; then he gave up and filled out an application only after Mr. Zhou Peiyuan went to get him moving him many times . " 
Another thing that moved Mr. Jin was Wang Xuan 's attitude toward the training of young people , " he himself stressed many times that what should be found and relied on are not what achievements I have achieved , not myself , but the training of young people . " 
Mr. Jin said that when Wang Xuan was around more than 50 years old , he started to pay attention to cultivating young people . He had stressed that we should pave a path , be willing to become a human ladder , and make way for young people . 
" It is not easy at all for a very accomplished scientist to do this . " 
The reporter learned from the Peking University news center that the mourning hall for Academician Wang Xuan will open to the public for people coming from various circles to express their condolences from 9 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every day from 9 a.m. on February 15 to 12:00 noon on February 19 . 
Professor Wang Xuan of Peking University died from a disease after the failure of a medical treatment at 11:03 p.m. on February 13 at Beijing Xiehe Hospital . He was 70 years old . He was praised as a " Contemporary Bi Sheng , " and had assumed positions including Vice - Chair of the National Political Consultation Conference , Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences , Academician of the Chinese Engineering Academy , and Academician of the Third World 's Academy of Sciences .

China to Implement Protection Regulation on Dissemination Rights for Information Networks 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , February 15 ( reporters : Zhou Wei and Li Fei ) . Many networks and websites currently rely on republishing a lot of news and reports from newspapers and magazines to increase their click rates , but many of them are neither authorized , nor pay related fees . To cope with this , Director of the Copyright Department of the State Copyright Bureau Wang Ziqiang said in a press conference , held by the News Office of the State Council on the 15th , that the State Cou 
Wang Ziqiang said that according to existing laws and regulations , regarding those works published in newspapers , as long as their authors did not state that " they cannot be used , " newspapers can use those works without their authors ' permission , but at the same time should pay them , and the State Copyright Bureau has made the payment standard specifically for newspaper reprint practices according to the law . 
However , according to regulations in existing laws , newspapers have the right to such legal permissions , but the Internet currently does not have rights for such legal permissions . 
According to related interpretations made by the People 's Supreme Court , the legal permission for newspaper reprints is applied to the Internet , i.e . to any small or short articles published in newspapers or on the Internet , whose authors did not state that " they cannot be used , " the Internet can use them without permission , but at the same time needs to pay their authors . 
But because the legal interpretation does not determine the payment standard , the Internet has not made payments when it used those works in practice . 
" Regarding whether the Internet use of published small or short works applies to the legal permission , it still needs to be determined according to the laws . " 
Wang Ziqiang said : " Whether it will be included in a category of law depends on the confirmation of the implementation of the Protection Regulation on Dissemination Rights for Information Networks this year . " 
( International ) Russian Military Says Georgian Parliament 's Resolution Will Not Affect Russia 's Peacekeeping Activities 
Xinhua News Agency , Moscow , February 15 ( reporter : Song Shiyi ) . Xie Duofu , a news officer for the Russian Defense Ministry , told the media on the 15th that the resolution made by the Georgian Parliament on Russia 's peacekeeping troops will not affect the Russian military 's peacekeeping activities in the short term , and Russian troops will continue to fulfill their peacekeeping mission in the conflict area of South Ossetia . 
The Chair of the Russian Independent State Affairs Committee of the State Duma ( lower house of the parliament ) , Kokoshin , made a speech and indicated regarding the resolution made by the Georgian Parliament on Russia 's peacekeeping troops , on the same day the resolution was published , that the resolution will harm the stability of the situation in that area and negatively impact the relations between Russia and Georgia . 
He stressed that the resolution made by the Georgian Parliament is a further bad step toward damaging the relations between Russia and Georgia . 
He thinks that the Georgian accusation against the Russian side is absurd . 
The Georgian Parliament passed the resolution on that day , and requested Russia 's peacekeeping troops to stop their peacekeeping activities in South Ossetia , but did not set a concrete deadline for Russia 's peacekeeping troops to withdraw . 
The Georgian Parliament accuses Russia 's peacekeeping personnel of a failure to fulfill their designated obligation , and regards the actions taken by Russia in the conflict area as " trying to annex Georgian territory . " 
The Georgian Parliament requests the Georgian government to take an active action and consider inviting international peacekeeping troops - to be stationed in the conflict area of South Ossetia - to replace the peacekeeping activities currently undertaken by Russia in that area . 
The Georgian Parliament also requests the government to revise a related agreement that determined the stationing of Russia 's peacekeeping personnel in the conflict area . 
South Ossetia is an autonomous Georgian state , and borders with Russia 's Republic of North Ossetia . 
It announced its own independence after the Soviet Union collapsed , and has been confronting Georgia 's central government for a long time . 
Russia currently has a peacekeeping battalion of 500 soldiers stationed in that area . 
The troops stationed there are based on the agreement signed by four parties - including Russia , Georgia , North Ossetia , and South Ossetia - in 1992 .

But at that time the circuit breaker did not automatically switch to the socket . Zhang Diankun , the head of the technici 
Those smoky underground cables , which should be laid out on a flat surface in very good order , were tangled together without any order , and fire prevention layers should be set up . 
Thus , three individuals including Zhao Yongchun , the 57 - year - old head of the electrical equipment installation team of the Textile Company of Liaoyuan City , Sun Fenglin , a retired cadre ( senior engineer ) from the Liaoyuan Power Affairs Bureau , and Jin Taicheng , a reemployed retiree worker at the Central Hospital of Liaoyuan City , will be prosecuted as suspects in the liability for the big accident .

Honesty and self - discipline should clearly come up as requirements when talking with newly promoted cadres in their appointment meetings . 
Leadership teams at every level should be urged to stick to the democratic centralization system , establish and perfect rules and procedures for meetings and decision - making , and carefully practice the system that integrates collective leadership with individual responsibility in related fields . 
The supervision over the major leader of a leadership team should be emphasized . Leaders of organization ( personnel ) departments should frequently talk with and conduct heart - to - heart talks with the major leader of a leadership team at the next lower level to learn the status of his ideology , work , and style of work , etc. 
A routine control and supervision system should be established and perfected for leaders ; the status of ideology and style of work of a leadership team should be regularly learned and analyzed , and suggestions and measures should be come up with to solve problems . 
A warning talk and letter inquiry system for leaders should be practiced . Once the hint of a problem emerges , a warning talk or letter inquiry should be promptly conducted . 
As for those obvious problems with leaders reported by the masses , they should be carefully investigated and clarified ; if a problem is true , the leader concerned should be criticized and educated , or disciplined by appropriate organizational measures ; if any leader violates any regulation or law , he or she should be transferred to the law or discipline enforcement organization to be investigated ; if a leader is found innocent through an investigation , a clarification should be ad

Supervision measures on the stages of cadres ' recommendation , nomination , test and review , discussion , and determination , etc. , should be further perfected , and cadres should be strictly selected and used , and vigorous support should be provided for recommendation and selection of cadres who are politically reliable , talented at their work , maintain a good style of work , and are trusted by the masses of people to take leadership positions at every level . 
The implementation status of the regulations for cadre appointment should be reviewed vigorously . Any conduct that violates the regulations for cadre appointment should be seriously investigated and disciplined , and indecent practices and corruption in the use of cadres should be firmly contained . 
A supervision and investigation system for any serious violation of regulations for the use of cadres should be practiced to further strengthen supervision , investigation , and disciplinary work . 
A system of selection and appointment of cadres - and investigation of their working responsibility - should be established and perfected . Based on the principle that power matches responsibility , every stage of the cadres ' selection and appointment work , including the main body of responsibility and content of responsibility , should be scientifically defined , and an investigation method should be clarified to strengthen investigation work . 
The supervision role played by the masses should be fully exercised to establish and perfect a reporting mechanism that is " convenient , secure , and highly efficient . " 
The supervision role played by public opinion should be fully employed , and the status of cadres ' selection and appointment work should be notified to the news media within an appropriate amount of time , and accept the supervision of public opinion . 
The suggestion proposes that a coordination mechanism of cadre supervision work should be further perfected . 
Organization ( personnel ) departments should strengthen coordination with discipline investigation organizations , establish a work communication system , contact person system , and responsibility system , with discipline investigation organizations in the aspect of cadres ' fair administration and their Party spirit , in order to strengthen integrated supervision . 
Visiting and investigation work should be carefully and well done with discipline investigation organizations ; visiting and investigating methods can be improved and perfected to promote visiting and investigation quality . 
An auditing system for leaders ' economic responsibility should be carefully practiced with auditing organizations . 
An internal supervision mechanism for cadres ' selection and appointment work of the organization departments should be perfected .

On the 15th , an economic affairs administration of the Taiwan authorities decided to fine Lianhua Electronics Corporation ( shortened name : " Liandian " ) , one of " the two giant wafer producers " in Taiwan , 5 million New Taiwan Dollars , because it " violates regulation by providing assistance and participating in creation " for Hejian Science and Technology Company on the Mainland . 
Taiwan 's China Times reported that this is the first case used by Taiwanese authorities to fine and discipline a Taiwanese business that invested on the Mainland since Chen Shui - bian came up with the economic and trade policy of " actively controlling and effectively opening . " 
As has been reported , a person from the Taiwan " Report and Review Committee of the Economic Department " said that the reason why Liandian was fined was because it violated " the Regulation of the People 's Relation across the Strait , " and regulations of " Permission Methods for Investment and Technological Cooperation on the Mainland . " 
In the future , the Report and Review Committee will fine Tsao Hsing - cheng , former Chair of the Board of Liandian , according to the circumstances . 
The " Liandian Case " originated in February 2005 , and by then Taiwanese investigation departments had used around a hundred people to hurriedly search the residences and offices of several high - level Liandian employees , and alleged that Liandian was suspected of investing on the Mainland and " illegally providing capital , technology , and human resources " to Hejian Science and Technology Company . 
Tsao Hsing - cheng , the then - Chair of the Liandian Board , later publicly stated that Liandian did not violate any of the Taiwan authorities ' regulations , and the assistance Liandian provided to Hejian Science and Technology was for Liandian 's long - term interest , and Liandian would lose business opportunities if it did not enter the Mainland market as soon as possible . 
After that , the " Financial Supervision and Control Committee " of the Taiwan authorities fined Liandian 3 million New Taiwan Dollars for its violation of the regulation regarding disclosure of commercial information . 
On January 9, 2006 , the Liandian Board accepted Tsao Hsing - cheng 's resignation , and he was formally prosecuted for violation of regulations on investment on the Mainland within several hours .

Those 5,243 shafts announced to the public , and more than 700 coal mine shafts recently reported from many local areas , should be completely and truly shut down . 
Closure should be regarded as a regular activity , and those coal mines that damage resources , pollute the environment , and lack safe conditions , should be continuously shut down . 
- - Strengthen basic control of coal mine safety . 
Immediately correct and stop losing management in a few big state - owned mines , and guide small mines that have mismanagement in establishing standard safety and management systems . 
Especially , major state - owned coal mines should be paid more attention to , and any productions exceeding their capacities , intensities , and fixed number of employees should never be allowed . 
The controlled percentages for safe production for this year require the number of deaths in various accidents nationwide to be decreased 3 % compared with that of last year , and among them , the number in coal mines to be decreased 3.5 % . 
The number of large accidents that cause more than ten deaths each should be decreased by 5 % , and among them , the number in coal mines should be decreased 7 % . 
These controlled percentages have been announced to every provincial people 's government , and local administrations are dividing them in terms of different levels and allocating them to grass - roots and businesses . 
Statistics show that there were 5,986 victims in coal mine accidents nationwide in 2005 , and the number was 0.7 % lower compared with that of last year . 
However , large accidents that had more than ten victims each have increased , and the number of victims has increased 66.6 % compared with that of last year . 
( International ) Barroso Appeals for Every Party to Make Compromise in Negotiation for Future Status of Kosovo 
Xinhua News Agency , Belgrade , February 17 ( reporter : He Yi ) . News from Pristina : Chair of the European Union Committee Barroso said in Pristina , the capital of Kosovo , on the 17th , that he hopes that all of the parties concerned are ready to make compromises in the negotiation process for the future status of Kosovo , and to make efforts for the eventual establishment of a democratic and multi - ethnically integrated Kosovo . 
Barroso also met the President of Kosovo 's Provisional Authorities , Sejdiu , and a representative of the ethnic Serbs of Kosovo , respectively , on that day and told the media that all of the parties concerned should have a tolerant attitude , and only a democratic and multi - ethnically integrated Kosovo that respects government administration and protects the interests of minorities can be acknowledged by the international society .

Before that , Barroso had visited Croatia , Serbia and Montenegro . He will also visit Macedonia , Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina . 
( Winter Olympic Games : Stimulant ) News Analysis : Pyleva Incident Might Be Settled by Leaving it Unsettled 
Xinhua News Agency , Turin , February 17 . News Analysis : Pyleva Incident Might Be Settled by Leaving it Unsettled 
Xinhua News Agency Reporters : Gao Peng , Ding Ying 
Although Italy reiterated that any athletes who are discovered using stimulants may face the " disaster of being jailed , " many cases currently demonstrate that it is unlikely to happen to Russian women 's biathlon athlete Olga Pyleva , who is at the center of the first scandal over stimulant use at the Winter Olympic Games . 
The first stimulant use scandal at the Turin Winter Olympic Games was exposed on the 16th , and Olga Pyleva was discovered to have used the illegal and banned drug carphedon . 
The next day , the International Olympic Committee announced that Pyleva had been thrown out of the Winter Olympic Games , and the silver medal she won for the 15 km women 's biathlon had been withdrawn . 
The same day , the International Winter Biathlon Alliance determined to forbid Pyleva to participate in the sport for two years . 
The International Olympic Committee has been implementing the regulation that once athletes are discovered using stimulants , they will lose their qualification to participate in the Games , and the scores they achieved will be withdrawn , but they are not subject to legal punishment . 
However , according to Italian law , the carrying and use of stimulants by any athlete are criminal activities . A law enforcement organization has the right to directly arrest and investigate any athlete who uses stimulants . Any violators of the law are subject to jail for 3 months to 3 years . 
The International Olympic Committee had been " bargaining " with the Italian government for one year , and eventually reached an agreement last December . Both sides agreed that during the period of the Winter Olympic Games , any athletes who use stimulants would be handled according to Italian laws . 
Through the unremitting efforts made by the International Olympic Committee , the Italian side made a compromise four days before the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympic Games , and promised that the police would not enter the Olympic Village to search athlete residences during the Olympic Games . But any athletes whose drug tests show positive will be investigated by Italian prosecution organizations . 
Some reports said that Pescante , an official of the Italian government responsible for supervision of the Turin Winter Olympic Games , has transferred Pyleva 's stimulant case to a Turin prosecution organization . 
However , the International Olympic Committee and Pescante himself have not confirmed this so far . 
Andrey Dmytriev , a doctor for the Russian Biathlon Team , disclosed at noontime on the 17th that Pyleva had left Turin and returned home . 
Shi Kangcheng , a Chinese sports official who had been in a position at the World Anti - Stimulant Organization for many years , thinks that once Pyleva returns home , this case might eventually " be settled by leaving it unsettled . " 
Shi Kangcheng said that the International Olympic Committee and the Italian government have not " completely addressed " the anti - stimulant issue at the Winter Olympic Games , and it is hard to say what the outcome would be even if Italian prosecution organizations really did get involved in the case . 
Based on past penalty cases in which Italy sentenced or punished its own athletes who used stimulants , the most serious penalty was merely a " two - year probation . " 
Thus , senior reporter Piali from the Italian ANSA said that the possibility of Pyleva being jailed is " very small , " and at most , she might be fined . 
Piali also said that although an Italian court could sentence her by default , it is impossible for the Italian police to catch Pyleva abroad and bring her back to serve the sentence . 
If Pyleva refuses to accept the sentence , the Italian side can do nothing about it . 
Comprehensive News : New Epidemic Spots Continuously Emerge ; Every Country in the World Taking Strict Prevention Measures 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , February 18 . A comprehensive report by Xinhua News Agency reporters abroad : Bird flu is further spread on the African continent . 
The World Health Organization confirmed on the 17th that birds have been found dead of infections by the bird flu virus in three areas of Egypt . 
In Europe , France also first discovered the H5 bird flu virus ; Europe and Africa are on high alert and strengthening prevention measures against the epidemic . 
Hussein Bushila , a consultant for the Eastern Mediterranean region of the WHO , told press in Egypt on the 17th that three areas in Egypt - including Cairo and Jizah in the central region , and Minya in the southern region - have found birds dead of H5N1 bird flu virus infection ; Egyptian government departments have started to kill poultries suspected of being infected with bird flu . 
Experts pointed out that Egypt is an important passage for migrant birds in the Middle East and North Africa . The possibility of migrant birds bringing bird flu virus across borders is very high . 
Egypt has announced a ban on import of any live poultries from foreign countries , and strengthened quarantine work at border ports . 
More than 800 chickens died of unknown causes on a chicken farm in the capital of Cameroon , Yaounde , in the past week . 
Cameroon has decided to immediately suspend imports of all poultries and pork from Nigeria , where the bird flu epidemic was discovered , and discontinued trade of poultries and related products in markets in border areas between the two countries . 
The Cameroonian government has also established a monitoring and detection network that can cover its overall territories for epidemic detection . Its Bayside Center and the State Veterinary Laboratory are also under an emergency status so that they can deploy any test work associated with the H5N1 virus at any time . 
In Europe , Denmark and Sweden initially excluded the epidemic on the 17th . 
The Swedish Veterinary Institute issued a test result that shows the dead swans found in Sweden this Wednesday were not infected with the bird flu virus . 
An initial test result done by the Danish State Veterinary Control Bureau also showed that the 30 dead swans found in Danish territories in recent days were not infected with the bird flu virus . 
But an agricultural department stated that Denmark still cannot lower its guard . 
9 bird flu epidemic spots have been discovered in Romania in Eastern Europe this year . WHO experts in Bucharest said on the 17th that bird flu has spread to almost every area of the Delta Region of the Danube River , and the situation must be carefully coped with , and Romania might be continuously threatened by bird flu within 3 to 5 years . 
In Bangladesh in Asia , the government has taken every measure necessary to prevent bird flu . 
The government 's Poultry Service Bureau has provided related officials books about prevention of bird flu , and also simultaneously organized poultry raisers for trainings . 
( Newspaper Digest ) China 's First Blood Sharing Information Management System Established in Zhejiang 
Xinhua News Agency , Beijing , February 18 . As the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province disclosed , China 's first blood sharing information data management and control network system has recently been formally established at the center and has been put into operation . 
A leader involved with the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province said that this means that any citizen who has freely donated his blood in any county ( city , district ) blood collection and supply institutions of Zhejiang Province will have a unique code record . When he donates blood again , information that determines if he is qualified to donate his blood will immediately show up as long as his code record , individual information , blood type , blood donation record , and time of last bloo 
The leader further explained that if the system shows a free - blood donor is still within an interval period through entering the related code records , it will point out that the person does not meet the requirements for blood donation at this time . 
In this way it can protect not only the health of the blood donor , but also the health and safety of blood recipients . 
In addition , when the blood supply is in shortage , a blood donor or his relatives can have the right to use his blood first . As long as you enter a valid I.D . for the blood donor , his related information will show up , which is pretty convenient . 
As Today 's Morning Journal of Hangzhou reported , the information system has currently been put into operation in 36 blood collection and supply institutions throughout the province . And the blood resources status for all of the blood collection and supply institutions in the province can also be shown in real time , which has accomplished data sharing throughout the province . 
11 Villages Hurriedly Evacuated in Case Mudslide Occurs Again 
Xinhua News Agency , Manila , February 18 . Local Philippines officials said on the 18th that 11 villages in the eastern Philippines have been hurriedly evacuated in case a similar mudslide occurs again . 
Rosette Lerias , a Southern Leyte Province official , said on that day that those villages are located in the same area as the village where a mudslide occurred on the 17th , and the terrain features are similar . 
Residents of the 11 villages who were evacuated will be placed in 7 evacuation centers . 
Lerias said that the government ordered residents to evacuate yesterday , and today it sent people to check those villages because some of the villagers do not want to leave their homes . 
The mudslide incident occurred on the 17th close to a village located beside a mountain in St. Bernard Township in the southern part of South Leyte Province . Mud and rocks had buried the entire village , and only a few roofs could be seen from TV footage . 
Since mud is very thick and wet , there is almost no hope for buried humans to survive . 
At present , 109 people have been found dead and 57 people have been rescued . 
As has been estimated , the number of deaths caused by the incident may be as high as 1,800 . 
( Overseas Chinese towns and their sentiments ) Exports in First Month of This Year in Quanzhou , Overseas Chinese Town in South Fujian , Increased 35.2 % Compared with That of Last Year 
Xinhua News Agency , Fuzhou , February 19 ( Guo Yu ) . Foreign trade in Quanzhou City continued to maintain its high - speed growth tendency in January of this year . 
Based on statistics from the Customs Office , exports for Quanzhou in January reached 0.33 billion USD , which is the best score in history , and increased 35.2 % compared with that of last year , and is higher than the average growth level of the whole province . 
As the Foreign Trade and Economic Bureau of Quanzhou City estimated , the reason why the foreign trade for Quanzhou grew rapidly in January is because it had benefited from several foreign trade support services and measures taken by Quanzhou ; enterprises were very enthusiastic about promoting exports ; economic operations in Quanzhou were thriving ; enterprises raised their confidence in running businesses ; and there was a highly efficient and unblocked environment for development of 
Championship Hopeful but Not a Sure Thing 
Loving Life and Luneng 
The gunpowder smoke of the Chinese Super Cup Soccer Game will soon bring flames of war . 
The Luneng Team of Taishan is ready for the new game season , and is preparing to rush to the championship again . 
The battles for seizing dominance among Lian , Lu , and Hu , the three strong teams , will break out at any moment . 
Who will win the championship at last ? 
Based on an analysis of actual strengths , although the Taishan Team has a great hope of seizing the championship , it has no full certainty of success . 
First , the time for new team members to adapt to each other is short . 
The Taishan Team had nothing new last year . 
The Taishan Team introduced Li Leilei and Wang Liang , the two members from the national team , this year . Soon after that , it will also add two members to the team from foreign teams , and its actual strength should be seen as increased , not reduced . 
But because the national team is preparing for the matches with the Palestinian and Iraqi teams , those members of the national team cannot coordinate with the members of this team . 
When they return to the football club , the league matches will start right away , 
So , the issue of adapting to each other is the biggest issue the Taishan Team is facing . 
I think that those members from the national team can be substitute players for the first several rounds of games in the league matches . 
Firstly , they can be trained to adapt to the team in matches ; 
secondly , those national team members who have played two group matches can have a rest . 
After several rounds of matches , their edge would be honed , and it won 't be too late for them to participate . 
Second , its defense has hidden problems . 
The defense of the Taishan Team was scolded as a sick one by its fans last year . 
Li Leilei was introduced this year , and has improved the defense , but the team has not reached the time for sitting back and relaxing . 
The problem of center halfbacks ' and fullbacks ' slowness in turning back still exists , and those substitute players are either older in age or lack experience . 
If center halfbacks and fullbacks can solidly play their roles , the Taishan Team would have one more advantage in its path to seizing the championship . 
I think that it does not hurt to use Ren Yongshun who has good physical qualities , although lacking experience . He can exercise this year in preparation for the future . 
And also , it is OK to withdraw Gao Rao to play fullback . 
Many members of the Taishan Team can play fullback , including Cui Peng and Hai Bin . 
Gao Rao is strong physically , and can aggressively and fiercely intercept the ball , and should be able to do a good job in the position of either center halfback or fullback . 
Third , whether foreign players can adapt to the team . 
The introduction of foreign players is a big issue that has been puzzling the Taishan Team . 
Nobody dares to say anything good about Dan Qiu 's performance last year . 
It is known that foreign players have not been selected for introduction for this year . 
I think that in addition to introduction of an outstanding forward , a very good left - foot forward should be introduced too . 
Except Xing Rui , who played on the Taishan Team several years ago , there has not been a real left - foot player on the team . 
Although some players like Cui Peng can play the role , a real left - foot forward would be much better than one who is a guest player . 
If these three issues can be solved well , the path for the Taishan Team to seize the championship should be somewhat smoother . 
As a Shandong football fan , I really hope that the Taishan Team will be able to seize the championship this year . 
But frankly speaking , the Taishan Team is very hopeful , but has no full guarantee of winning the championship this year . 
Baidi Ad Incorporated into JWT Network ; Is It Too Late Now to Say Happy New Year ? 
BrandVista Post : 
How is everyone ? 
The Spring Festival has passed us again like this , and friends who combined vacations with the Spring Festival holidays have gradually returned to their posts . 
We wish all friends a happy new year , if it is not too late to say Happy New Year now . 
On that day I chatted with NPLCN in a cafe ; he mentioned that the present Geometry Brand 
Website looks much prettier . 
Good from contents to formats . 
His most favorite is the recent thoroughly innovated BBS that is based on Discuz Community . 
As for the community , I have to thank someone . 
He is Mr. Li Mingshun , the General Manager of Discuz Beijing Corporation . 
A heap of results can be found if you search his name on Google . 
You probably know that he was at Sina.com , and later he himself created a business , and established an Internet advertisement exchange platform for small and medium - size enterprises , similar to adbrite.com abroad . 
He debated on MSN at that time . His rough idea is that : Geometry feels that the development of many of China 's industries depends on the strength of private economy and small and medium - size enterprises . 
But in China 's present market , this situation cannot make people optimistic . 
So , intellectual trades , similar services , and consultation of small and medium - size enterprises cannot form sizable ones . 
Collection of higher fees for their own development will eventually bring a pessimistic cycle . 
He later went to Discuz . 
Discuz is an excellent community program based on PHP and MySQL databases . 
With the help of Ramboo , a technical engineer from Beijing , Geometry Brand 's community is finally seeing the light again , and is stepping on stage with a very fresh face . 
The feedback is very good . 
The interface is clean and friendly . 
Speed is quite quick . 
I 'm starting to feel a kind of joy at writing words that make myself aware of something and inspire others , and communicate with friends who pursue the same thing in the same trade about small things in our work and life in a very clean interface . 
Thanks Discuz ! 
There is a lot of news in the advertisement field . 
The system on opening advertisement trade regulated by the WTO is starting to be implemented from the beginning of January . 
All of the big Laowai ( old foreigners ) have arrived on the site , one after another , and small Laowai are sharpening their knives noisily . It seems to be prosperous everywhere . 
Baidi Advertising out of Singapore has many troubles . 
Sir Martin is finally finding a little time away from the lawsuit in Italy to consider shuffling the deck after losing some heavyweight customers and continuous development setbacks on the Mainland . 
Baidi Advertising and Batey will be incorporated into JWT network and maintain their brands , and will be managed by JWT . 
And at the same time , some rumors say that Bates and 141 networks will be incorporated into the Aomei system , and will be managed by Aomei Advertising Network . 
Although 141 has been returned to Aomei before , it is still an interesting thing to let Da Pisi return to Aomei . 
Websites have updated many articles during the Spring Festival . We don 't need to mention every one of them here . 
If everybody has time , he or she can check Websites . 
At the same time , friends who have not participated in the new forum can click the mouse one more time without any trouble , and enter into the totally new Geometry Brand community . 
Feel the environment , experience the atmosphere , and contribute your words . 
Hope you 'll be happy for finding the organization . 
We wish every friend a beautiful mood . 
Best Wishes !

Mom of Ten Years Ago 
Helen Li 
Read this article , and wanted to share it with people . 
This is not an impulsion , but warmness and kindness staying in my heart for a long time . 
I ask myself if it were me , what I would do . 
The answer is very clear . I would hang up the phone , " You dialed a wrong number . " 
This year I have been thinking about what really counts for helping people . 
I have given up tentative conduct , such as donations of cash or items . 
Some friend said a couple of days ago that he has no time to take care of himself , not mention to help people , even though his desire for providing help is bigger than his ability . 
Wish you a happy day : )

Mom of Ten Years Ago 
It was one day ten years ago when this teacher was taking a nap by using the rest time at noon . Suddenly , the phone rang . 
She picked up the phone , and heard a strange and rude voice : " Your child stole a book , and we caught her . Come and hurry up ! " 
The crying noise of a little girl and denouncing voices from others came out of the handset . 
She understood the thing immediately when she turned her head and looked at her only daughter , who was watching TV . 
There must be a little girl who was caught by the saleswoman for stealing a book . She does not want her family members to know this , so she made up a phone number , and a phone call happens to come here . 
She could of course hang up the phone and give no response , and even scold the other side . 
Because this thing has nothing to do with her . 
But she herself is a teacher ; maybe that girl is one of her pupils . 
She could probably imagine through the phone that that little girl , who made a wrong decision at that moment , must be very panicked , and may be facing the most terrible situation of her life . 
After she hesitated for a moment , she suddenly had an idea in her mind . Yes , I will do it this way . 
Then , she asked for the detailed address of the bookstore , and hurried there . 
As she expected , a little girl with tear stains all over her face was standing in the bookstore . 
And those adults standing around were scolding her ferociously in loud voices . 
She rushed to the poor little girl and held her in her arms , and turned her head to the sales clerks around , and said : " Talk to me if you have something to say . Do not terrify the child . " 
She took the little girl with her and walked out of the bookstore after she paid out several dozen Yuan as a fine , while the sales clerks were whispering reluctantly . Then , she could clearly see the face messed with tears and panic . 
She smiled , and brought the little girl home . She cleaned her up thoroughly and let her go without asking anything . 
She especially urged her before she left , " If you want to read books , you could come here , auntie 's home has a lot of books . " 
The little girl , who was still in a panic , gazed at her deeply before running away , and never showed up again . 
Time passes as quickly as running water , and a period of ten years has passed in a flash without notice . 
She had forgotten the thing a long time ago , and still lives there with a calm and serene life . 
One afternoon , knocking noises came from outside the door . 
A young and strange girl with a pretty face appeared when she opened the door . She had a big smile on her face and was holding a big pile of gifts in her hands . 
" Who are you looking for ? " 
She asked with doubt . 
The girl was moved and talked with a lot of words . 
It was not easy for her to find out from the strange girl 's talking that she was the little girl of that year . Ten years after , she had graduated from a university without any difficulties , and now she had made a special trip to see her . 
The young girl said with a soft voice and tears in her eyes : " Although I still don 't understand why you were willing to pretend to be my mom and save me , during these 10 years , I have always felt that I want to call you mom . " 
The teacher 's eyes also started to become blurred . 
" If I did not help you that day , what was going to happen to you ? " She asked with curiosity . 
The face of the girl suddenly became gloomy . She shook her head slightly and said , " I cannot explain it clearly , I might have done a stupid thing or even killed myself . " 
The teacher felt a sudden jump in her heart , and began to rejoice in her mind . 
The decision she made at that moment in that year could even impact a person in her life . 
Looking at the happy smile on the face of that girl , she also smiled with her .

The world is filled with lies and frauds in trash short - text messages flying everywhere . Buddha said , " If I do not enter hell , who would enter hell , " 
anyone who does this , then , congratulate him , he can become a Buddha sooner . 
Any human being has a kind personality when he starts his life . 
Everyone has a sympathetic heart . 
Now social ethics is going down day by day , and human hearts are not what they were in those old days . 
Maybe only selfless Buddha can do something good . 
Military Situation Observation : How Long can Iran Hold Up under Air Attacks by US Armed Forces ? 
Yun Feiquan 
If traditional warfare of attrition is described as letting an opponent bleed to death , then modern warfare is shooting at the head of an opponent first and making him a " human vegetable " before he bleeds . 
The gap between the military capabilities of Iran and the United States is not their quantities , but understanding of modern warfare . 
Iran , which came to a draw with Iraq in an eight - year war , does not seem to understand the real meaning of modern high - tech warfare . 
The British International Intelligence Comments pointed out a few days ago , after it analyzed the state of US armed forces movements , that the US armed forces are preparing to launch large - scale air attacks on Iran ... 
The current status of the Iranian air force is worrisome . 
The present status of the Iranian air forces is quite similar with that of the Iraqi air force before the Iraq War in 2003 . 
Iran itself does not have the capacity to independently develop modern weapons , and is embargoed from importing weapons from the West . 
Once a war breaks out , it is really a question of whether those old and obsolete aircrafts of the Iranian air force could take off to confront the US armed forces . 
Currently , the Iranian air defense system is mainly composed of the air force and ground air defense troops of the Iranian regular armed forces , and the air - defense forces of the Revolutionary Guard Corps . 
Among them , the Iranian air forces have around 50,000 troops , and more than 300 various types of combat aircrafts . 
Their primary aircraft models include the F-4 " Phantom , " F-5 " Tiger , " and F-14 " Tomcat " made by the US and the MIG-29 made by Russia , etc. 
The ground air defense troops are mainly equipped with surface to air missiles , including the US " Hawk , " British " Javelin " and some of the Russian " SAM " series of missiles . 
Harold Hutchinson , a US military expert , and Helamuchisin , a military expert from Russia 's Politics and Military Analysis Institute , analyzed the current status of the Iranian air defense forces , and think that the Iranian air defense capacities and air defense system and construction still have some loopholes in the current status . 
Hutchinson thinks that the Iranian air forces are not at all at the same level with the US armed forces from the perspective of whole actual strength . 
A lot of the Iranian combat aircrafts made by the US cannot be used because of lack of parts , upgrades , and maintenance . 
The F-14 fighter planes previously regarded as the elite ones in the Iranian air force only have about ten capable of taking off from the ground . 
The combat reliability of AIM 54 " Phoenix " missiles , claimed to be capable of over - the - horizon attacks , is also doubtful . 
Helamuchisin pointed out that those Iranian air defense missile systems provided by the US from the 1970s to the 1980s of the last century have lost their combat powers because of lack of spare parts . 
And other air defense weapons that do not form any systems , such as weapons obtained from Russia and other countries , have no capabilities at all to cope with the US armed forces , which have powerful electromagnetic combat capabilities . 
Scrappy weapons affect combat power 
Apparently , the Iranian government realizes that its fate in a war depends on whether it is capable of defending the sky over its head , and is starting to prepare only at the last moment , scrape weapons together , and strengthen its air defense system . 
Its methods can be summed up as the two strategies from the current state : 
The first one is to conceal important nuclear facilities as much as possible and strengthen their anti - strike capabilities . 
According to a report from the British newspaper Times , Iran has hidden core parts of its nuclear facilities 18 meters under ground and added a protection shell of 2 - meter - thick cement , including the nuclear plant in Natanz and the uranium enrichment center in Isfahan . 
But the US armed forces have taken a strategy in advance . They saw the effects of underground bunkers in anti - air attack combat as early as during the Gulf War in 1991 , and have rushed developing various ground - penetrating bombs . 
Through more than 10 years ' studies on targets , the US armed forces have had a whole set of combat methods and weapons coping with underground consolidated bunkers . 
Iran has also purchased a lot of advanced air defense weapons from Russia in recent years . 
Since the end of last year , the Iranian government has reached agreements with Russia , one after another , for the purchase of the Pechora-2A air defense missile system and 29 sets of " Dower " air defense missile systems , worth 700 million US dollars . 
However , a modern war is a rivalry between systems . 
Various US armed forces air - attack weapons are developed by the US itself , and they have been sharpened and become a set of war machines with outstanding effects after years of tests in actual warfare . 
And those " new weapons " scraped together by Iran from other countries are still a question of whether they can form combat power in a short time . 
Weapons are not Iran 's only gap . 
Combat Outlines , published by the US armed forces in 1982 , first came up with the idea of " integrated air - ground warfare , " and stressed the use of air supremacy to strike high - value targets in an enemy 's strategic depth area , paralyzing the enemy 's command system at the beginning of a war , and making him as " meat on the cutting board " even though he has very powerful conventional forces . 
In the Gulf War in 1991 , Kosovo War in 1999 , and the Iraq War in 2003 , what the US armed forces paid attention to was not how many aircrafts the opponents had , but the firing range of their own " Tomahawk " cruise missile . 
Although the Iranian government has prepared for possible air attacks and started to take measures to strengthen air defense capabilities , Iran , which came to a draw with Iraq in an eight - year war , does not seem to understand the real meaning of modern high - tech warfare . 
With the development of US armed forces military transition work in recent years , the air - attack activities of the US armed forces are totally different from the carpet bombing method in the Vietnam War era , and rely on various new high - tech weapons and high - precision and whole - depth air strikes that are based on modern information technology . 
How long the Iranian ground air defense system can sustain itself in this kind of air strikes is still an unknown element .

Rivaling Microsoft by Uniting with Google ; Is Dell Collecting a " Stocking Fee ? " 
Yun Feiquan 
Dell Inc . ( US ; DELL ) and Google confirmed on Tuesday that Dell is testing personal computers loaded with Google 's software packages . 
This move might pose a serious threat to the dominant status of Microsoft Corp. , MSFT , in the PC software market . 
Jess Blackburn , the news spokesman for Dell Corporation , said that the corporation is assessing Google 's software . 
After the software is installed , PC users can use the software to search not only on the Internet , but also for information stored on their PCs . 
Blackburn confirmed that the software the corporation is testing includes the Dell homepage supported by Google , Google 's desktop search system and Google 's toolbar . 
Google 's news spokesman , Jon Murchinson , also confirmed at the same time that his company is testing a batch of software , developed by Google , with Dell . 
As the Wall Street Journal previously reported , Google - the IT new baron - is negotiating with Dell and Hewlett - Packard Co . , and is trying to persuade these computer manufacturing giants to install Google 's software for their computers . 
According to an internal source cited by the Wall Street Journal , to achieve the goal , Google might pay 1 billion dollars to Dell in the coming three years . 
However , neither company has disclosed related details . 
And also , the Hewlett - Packard side has refused to make a comment on it . 
The Microsoft Corporation news spokesman , Neil Charney , refused to make a comment on the news mentioned above . 
Microsoft is currently planning to promote its next - generation search tool for the Windows operating system and strengthen development of its online business . 
On the day the news was released , Google 's stock price fell another 4.46 % , dropping to 367.92 dollars . 
The Microsoft 's stock price fell 1 % , and closed at 26.94 dollars on that day . 
Some analysts pointed out that Google is anxious to seek another direction of expansion in addition to network searches , and that its integration with Dell and other PC giants might prompt Google to threaten Microsoft 's core business . 
Matt Rosoff , an analyst on Microsoft 's direction at a market investigation and research company , said that Microsoft is absolutely concerned and worried that Google is eager to expand its new income sources . 
But some analysts do not think so . 
Charles Di Bona , an analyst at market analysis company Sanford C. Bernstein , pointed out that it is too early for Google to shake Microsoft 's dominant status . 
Reporter 's Journal : Google Shakes Microsoft 's Domination ? 
Hui Zhengyi 
There is no doubt that computers have become necessities in the life and work of modern people . 
However , there is only a minority of people who understand the working rationale of computers , when everyone can skillfully operate them . 
Like they use " dummy " cameras , most " newbies " can play the black boxes well as long as those boxes have friendly interfaces , and convenient and simple software . 
Thus , original software installed on a PC manufacturer 's products can usually determine most consumers ' using habits . 
It is through this measure that Microsoft has tightly controlled the PC operating system market . 
Right now , Google , a new rival of Microsoft , tends to share part of the market through the same measure . 
A well - known economics medium in Taiwan recently made a very interesting metaphor . 
" Computer manufacturers including Dell and Hewlett - Packard are starting to use computers like shelves in a supermarket and are collecting the " stocking fee " from software companies . 
A successful bidder can make its own software show up in the 'critical ten minutes ' when users turn on their new computers , and guide consumers to use its products . 
This kind of fee collection mode is like how a supermarket collects stocking fees from food manufacturers . 
This phenomenon demonstrates that Microsoft 's control power is beginning to loosen without a doubt . 
Managers at Microsoft have warned Bill Gates that the Microsoft 's hegemonic status will eventually be threatened if Google starts to pay PC manufacturers for installation of Google 's software on their computer products . 
No matter what the outcome is , the number one status that Microsoft has been enjoying in those comfortable days may become history . 
After all , it is easy to become dominant , but it is difficult to maintain a dominant status .

Just Sword : Prospects for 2006 
Author : Just Sword 
I remember that in the beginning of 2005 , Apple Journal in Hong Kong published an article titled " Dharma Wheel Spins Constantly and Its Merits Can Overcome an Enemy Country . " 
The article alleged that 2004 was a year in which Falun Gong advanced rapidly while singing triumphant songs . 
The article stated that overseas officials of the Chinese Communist Party acted like buffoons suppressing Falun Gong in various places , and totally lost face when beginning Falun Gong learners told the truths everywhere in the world . 
But compared with the marvelous scene showing the great wave of Party membership withdrawal brought by the " Nine Comments " in 2005 , 2004 does not seem outstanding . 
Then , how will 2006 be ? 
The two events that occurred at the beginning of this year can probably demonstrate some development track for this year . 
One is the article " Elimination of Evil " published by the founder of Falun Gong . This article announced and sentenced that those agents of the Chinese Communist Party will face their coming judgment day after July 20, 1999 . 
Maybe many people still have doubts about or disbelieve this article . 
But no matter whether they believe it or not , the history and facts will prove it ! 
Of course , those agents of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are like rats living in dark ditches . 
Their " natural or accidental death " will not draw attention from the society and public opinion . 
But broad deaths or remorse of CCP agents at home and abroad brought by the Heavens will definitely bring powerful strikes and shake the power strata of the CCP . 
They will have to carefully consider their path of retreat and road for life - withdrawal from the Party , desertion or changing their side under the awesome deterrence of the elimination brought by the Heavens . 
Thus , the " superbly stable bureaucratic system and group of the CCP " will begin to be shaken , disrupted , and collapse ! 
The other event is the hunger strike campaign for human rights launched by Gao Zhicheng . 
This suddenly arisen campaign , which did not receive a good prediction from some people in the beginning , unexpectedly brought warm reactions from everywhere in the world , and common responses from all strata and various forces . 
If this activity can integrate various just forces and suffering masses into a connection and make it real and big , then the outside force that launches the final strike on the CCP , the evil regime that is as fragile as a pile of eggs , will finally be formed from it . 
If we say that 2005 was a year when the Communist Party was eliminated from the perspective of the spiritual aspect , then 2006 will be the phase in which the Party will be gotten rid of in both the spiritual and material aspects . 
With the further spread of the " Nine Comments " and further development of the wave of Party membership withdrawal , the self - disruption of the CCP , and the cohesion and formation of outside just forces , the life of the CCP monster will formally enter into a countdown state . 
The wills of the Heavens and humans have been integrated , and the sacred power and human strength are gathering . 
The long sword in the sky is directly pointed at the CCP monster ! 
If we say that 2004 was a year for advancing rapidly while singing triumphant songs , and 2005 is a marvelous year , then what will be the conclusion of 2006 ? 
I hope it will be a shocking great change , and a victory and triumphant return !

Xu Zhiyong : A Letter to Li Qun , the Secretary of Linyi City Party Committee 
< POSTER > Fa Buer 
Sender : sunnypku ( sunny ) 
Mail area : square 
Title : Xu Zhiyong : A Letter to Li Qun , the Secretary of Linyi City Party Committee : Hooliganism will Also Harm Yourself 
Website for sending mail : Feeling Like Old Friends at the First Meeting ( Wed Feb 8 13:56:14 2006 ) . This website ( yjrg.net ) 
Until yesterday , the government of Linyi , led by you , had illegally placed Chen Guangcheng under house arrest for 165 days . 
You collaborated with rogues and the mafia society to put a blind legal citizen in jail illegally for a long time . 
You cut off his home 's phone line , installed a cell phone jamming device in his yard ; 
You also beat him and his family members many times . 
Your barbarous conduct has gone beyond the bottom line of a civilized society . 
You also used means of rogues and the mafia society to beat me and lawyer Li Fangping in the beginning of October, 2005 . But we bore this , and we always tried to understand your difficult situation as much as possible , and were even acquiescent for a time of the house arrest of Chen Guangcheng . 
However , 165 days have passed . You not only have not controlled your behavior , but you also make it worse . 
You sent a big team of policemen and rogues to harass villagers ; 
You continued to arrest and beat villagers ; 
What you have done is too outrageous ! 
Today , I clearly remind you that those means of rogues and the mafia society will harm yourself in turn at the moment when you continue to organize rogues and the mafia society to besiege Chen Guangcheng . 
It was worth your examination when this thing started in the beginning . 
The family planning of Linyi is the first one from the bottom of the provincial list in the whole province . 
The anxiety in your mind is understandable as the secretary of the city Party committee . 
But it is wrong for you to think that only use of violence and force can implement the state 's law and policy because of the low qualities of the people in Linyi . 
Whose fault exactly is it that citizens do not coordinate with the conduct of the government ? 
Is it because of the low qualities of the citizens or much less public trust , since the government has told too many lies and made too many schemes ? 
If (we) say that the same government 's conduct was not that absurd ten years ago , in 2005 China 's society has made obvious progress and human rights protection has been written into the Constitution ; don 't you think that your barbarous conduct is too outrageous ? 
Why don 't you examine that only your Linyi dares to act in this way ? 
Why is only your Linyi unable to practice law enforcement by using democratic and legal means ? 
Linyi City should have been able to make a sincere explanation and make the public understand , after a batch of brave citizens including Chen Guangcheng reported about the fact of the barbarous law enforcement , a batch of citizens including Teng Biao - who dared to protect citizen 's rights - were involved , and the investigation conclusion was made by the National Family Planning Committee . 
After all , family planning is a difficult topic with Chinese characteristics . 
Everyone can understand your difficulties . 
However , you took a further absurd measure - brought Chen Guangcheng back and put him in jail by catching him from Beijing - and also tried to accuse him of illegally providing the state 's confidential information . 
Don 't you think that it is a very absurd accusation for a blind man who lives in a poor mountain village ? 
In fact , as long as you have truly corrected mistakes , as long as you have done things very well , are you still afraid of the criticism of a blind man ? 
Is it necessary for you to send several dozens of people to watch him 24 hours a day , and even sentence him in a hurried and desperate way ? 
I and Lawyer Li Fangping arrived in Dongshigu Village on October 4, 2005 . We demonstrated our very clear position and hoped to solve the conflicts . 
We made a suggestion that we could talk with your officials to learn your ideas and requests . 
We took the initiative and suggested that we could help you to persuade Chen Guangcheng , to influence him not to say some of his words . 
We hoped that you would not treat a blind man in this way , and both sides should make some compromises . 
However , your decision maker just follow his own way , and moreover , even had " carefully planned " an episode - to beat and put us in jail illegally . 
Do you think that your activities can make us scared ? 
We have not done anything that violates laws . 
We are fearless . 
Although China 's legal system is not perfect , at least it has not become absolutely lawless . 
You think that use of means of rogues and the mafia society can scare us away , then you have greatly underestimated our determination and willpower . 
As long as we would like to , we have many people who have many legitimate reasons to go to Linyi or go to see Chen Guangcheng . 
You can beat lawyers and scholars one , two , and three times , but every time would attract broad attention and reports about it . 
Do you really dare to beat us ten times ? 
Don 't you care about your official position very much ? 
If somebody is beaten and injured , will your position still be in a solid status ? 
Not listening to our reasonable advice , instead using some indecent means of rogues , don 't you think this is very silly and dangerous ? 
I want to tell you clearly that , in China , there is a big batch of excellent citizens who are loyal to conscience and follow the legal system . 
We do not fear rogues and the mafia society . 
We cannot stand reckless trampling on the bottom line of human civilization . 
If you have done too much beyond boundaries , we will calmly and confidently march forward batch by batch toward your sticks until the moment when you retreat . 
You should be clear that use of the means of rogues and the mafia society is not something good for you . 
Do not think that you can get rid of any link connected with those local rogues or hooligans who beat villagers as long as you hide backstage . 
Finally , I also want to remind you to treat Chen Guangcheng well . 
A person who was blind from his childhood , graduated from a college of traditional Chinese medicine , self - studied laws and English , and sued Beijing Subway Company for the interest of the blind , and brought tap water for villagers , and became a well - known " Lawyer Chen " everywhere . 
You even mobilized shameful indecent individuals to make rumors about and slander him , and tried to accuse him of illegally sending confidential information across the border . Don 't you think that what you did is too outrageous ? 
It is illegal for you to place Chen Guangcheng under house arrest , and it is also dangerous for you to do this . 
You should have been able to release him for sure . 
If the conduct of barbarous law enforcement has been stopped , how long could he maintain the criticism if you let him criticize it freely ? 
But today you are continuously smearing your own image . 
You won 't be peaceful as long as Chen Guangcheng has not been set for free for a day . 
It is enough for you to make him suffer . 
We would never stand by and do nothing if you still want to charge him with any crime or use further rogue means . 
Citizen Xu Zhiyong , February 8, 2006 
Does the Chinese Nation Deserve to Have Democracy ? 
< POSTER > Exploration of the path of China 's peace and liberation , and promotion of the ideological liberation of our countrymen 
I admit very disappointedly that the Chinese nation does not deserve to have democracy ! ! ! 
Aren 't those who post their messages here doing this thing now ! 
The pity is that there are not many people who go online and read it ( compared with 1.4 billion ) . 
Those who go online and care and participate in these kinds of topics would be much fewer : I dare to allege that the number would be less than 1 % of people online . 
Not to mention that this network has the Golden Shield project , which is the biggest , most thorough , advanced , expensive , and quality one . 
It is true . 
One could feel depressed , hopeless , helpless , and even think of surrendering , but if one wants to live a human life , whom can he depend on except that he himself struggles for it ? 
Although doing a thing depends on human effort , and success relies on the Heavens , I would think I am wrong if I have not made an effort for my own ideal , even though it is not successful , and I deserve to live like a dog . 
Making an effort for a just thing itself can make one 's own life somewhat wonderful , and at least in his heart when he evaluates himself . 
In fact , I do not need to be concerned about China 's future at all , 
because the environment in the world is no longer allowing a regime that has not been elected to exist for long . 
This is just a matter of time . 
What I lament is that the Chinese nation is very lucky to be led on the path to hell by a world - class great man and completely exploited from its bone and blood whenever it is at a historical turning point . Even if somebody calls piles of white bones and areas of blood stains along the path as brilliances , and forces us to be proud of the brilliances . 
Everywhere has a dark night , but the longest one is in Shenzhou ( the sacred state ) . 
People would suffer a lot when the Qin Emperor integrated with the Confucian Sage . 
Qin Shihuang was an open tyranny and the Confucian Sage privately washed brains . 
It is not that Chinese people do not deserve to have democracy ; it is because they have not had the democratic gene or their gene has been degenerated . 
A nation that has been established for more than three thousand years , it might have had democracy a long time ago if its national culture contained democratic elements . 
What were Chinese people doing when Athens established a democratic system , Rome set up a republic , the British passed the Constitution , the French published the Declaration of Human Rights , and the Americans issued the Declaration of Independence ? 
Mongolians had a Kurultai system for selection of their king before they entered into Zhong Yuan ; Manchurians in their early time had a Ministers Council of the Prince Regent for democratic consultation . Why were those systems all gone when they entered into the Han region ? 
Chinese people pursue materials only and have no interest in spiritual faith and political rights . 
If you do not believe it , as long as a Chinese person has an election right , he can sell it to you for a meat pancake . 
500,000 years later , if Chinese people want democracy , there must be an earthquake coming . If you can run , please do it !

Dalai Envoy Holding Closed - Door Meeting with Chinese Officials 
CGP Beili 
Dalai Envoy Holding Closed - Door Meeting with Chinese Officials 
The Dalai Lama stressed that he hopes that Tibet will have autonomy instead of independence . 
An envoy of the Dalai Lama , the Tibetan spiritual leader in exile , is holding a closed - door meeting with Chinese officials in Beijing , and no details have been disclosed publicly . 
This is the fifth formal meeting since China and the Dalai government in exile restored their contact in 2002 . 
But as usual , neither side has disclosed any details when holding the closed - door meeting . 
A reporter said that both sides have held many talks , but have not made any substantial achievement so far . 
The Dalai Lama , who is in exile in North India , said that he hopes that Tibet will have autonomy instead of independence . 
The Chinese side refused to make any comment on the bilateral talks . 
But as analysts said , the reason why Beijing hoped to have the bilateral talks is partially because it is worried that if the spiritual leader in exile dies , it might make Tibetans unhappier about China 's rule . 
Cultural identification 
The Dalai government in exile delegation is led by Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari , who was the chief delegate for several previous talks . 
A spokesman for the Tibetan government in exile said that several talks held in Switzerland between them and Chinese officials in 2005 were very " close and frank , " which brings hope to Tibetans . 
The spokesman said that they hope to eventually solve related issues with the Chinese leadership based on the foundation established by negotiations , and let the Tibetans have freedom , and maintain the cultural identification that they think is the most important thing . 
CGP Beili 
Dalai Lama Envoy Reiterated not to Seek Tibetan Independence . 
The Dalai Lama will visit Washington DC this month . 
Before the Dalai Lama , the Tibetan spiritual leader , visits the United States on November 8 , his envoy said that the Tibetan government in exile does not request Tibetan independence . 
Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said in Washington that he hopes that the Chinese government will ensure protection of the unique Tibetan culture and tradition . 
It is expected that when the Dalai Lama visits the United States next week , he will discuss Tibetan issues with President Bush , and hope that Bush could urge the Chinese government to give Tibet real autonomy . 
Delegates of the Dalai and officials from Beijing had direct contact for the first time in Bern in July of this year . 
" A Real Autonomy " 
Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari pointed out that both the Tibetan government in exile and Chinese authorities have seen some positive aspects from their talks in recent years . 
The Dalai Lama 's envoy discovered that leaders from Beijing , especially those delegates of the Central United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party , are more willing to listen to their views than they did before . 
However , Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said that there are too many differences between the Tibetan government in exile and the Chinese government , and there is a big gap between the positions of both sides . 
He said that in the past five years , the Tibetan government in exile has done its best to create a good environment for negotiation requested by China , 
and China should also create a good environment for negotiation of the Tibetan issue , and should not suppress the Dalai Lama all the time . 
He said that the Dalai Lama does not request Tibetan independence , and Tibet is still a part of China , but the Chinese government must maintain the unique culture of Tibet and " let Tibetans have a real autonomy . " 
Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari also pointed out that some Chinese think that as soon as the Dalai Lama passes away , the Tibetan issue will disappear . 
He said that this view is very dangerous , because once the Dalai Lama is gone , China would lose the historical opportunity to solve the Tibetan issue . 
He said that as long as the Chinese government responds to the request raised by the Dalai Lama , and comes up with a final solution , the Dalai Lama would not need to talk about the Tibetan issue internationally any more . 
Negotiation and Compromise are the Important Means of Democracy ! (ZT) 
Houze 
I just now saw a poster on " Great Decency - To Old Mr. Guiren " sent by a network friend . 
His ( her ) original words are that " Negotiation and compromise are the important means of democracy . Otherwise , a split because of different views is a failure of democracy ! ! ! Hope that those ideal democrats pay fully attention to this ! " 
This plain and tasteless sentence , which has not attracted interest from any network friends , has made me imagine a lot and have many sorts of feelings . 
At that moment I thought of the ancient times of China and the past of the West . 
I seldom sent the main poster . I cannot help but reply to the poster of the network friend in the way of the main poster . 
Let 's see China 's ancient times . 
Everyone knows that since Qin Shihuang established the universally unified and centralized power system in China , any subsequent dynasties were operated under the political framework . 
Although the Han Dynasty temporarily implemented a " two - track system , " i.e . a political system that practiced the feudal system and centralized power system at the same time , it eventually switched to a complete centralized power system in the end . 
The outcome of this kind of centralized power system had an advanced aspect in the historical condition by then , which promoted the development of productivity . 
But we should also see that the long - term operation of the system for more than 2,000 years had made local administrations lacking of their creativities , initiatives , and enthusiasms , and unable to make various suitable systems and policies for local developments based on local circumstances . 
The pyramid type of ruling system had made lower - class officials looking upward only and following directions from their superiors for everything . 
There was no room for coordination and negotiation because even local officials at the county level were appointed by the central government , not to mention those common people . 
When rights of farmers were infringed upon in ancient China , they could only bear it time and again . 
Only when their basest rights were threatened , i.e . when a famine spread in big areas , a tyrannical rule or natural disaster caused loss of their living rights , would they rebel . 
In more than 2,000 years , many peasant uprisings spread everywhere in the country like storms , but they never won a victory in a real sense except Zhu Yuanzhang , from Chen Sheng , and Wu Guang , who did not plan their uprising to the planned Huang Jin Insurrection , from the Huang Chao Revolt in the Tang Dynasty to the Li Zhicheng Rebellion that established a dynasty for only a month . 
Even the Ming Dynasty created by Zhu Yuanzhang was only a cycle of other dynasties , and there were no systematic changes . 
Zhu Yuanzhang , who came from a common family and did not receive much education , played the Chinese ancient centralized power system to a sick extent , and to extremes . Since then , the vigorous state of the type of the Tang Dynasty that was open , free , and tolerant , had become depressed . 
The atmosphere of freedom of speech disappeared in the vast land of China for a time . 
Human nature was suppressed to the maximum extent . 
Everybody became very cautious and dared not to say more words with reverence and awe . 
This was the only outcome of peasant uprisings in 2,000 years , and it made Chinese people neither humans nor ghosts . 
Let 's see the Medieval Ages of the so - called dark time in Western Europe . 
The Medieval Ages of Western Europe were formed after the Western Rome was destroyed by nomadic nations , and lasted for a thousand years . They had nothing to do with the ancient Greece and Rome of the past . 
Those ages featured the feudal system , i.e . land holding . 
Many layers of land feudal lords , from the top to the bottom , had more autonomy . 
No matter whether small feudal lords who had an area of several square kilometers , or nobles who had titles of Duke , Marquis , Count , Viscount , and Baron , since superiors and inferiors , and the left and right , could balance , restrain , and were interdependent with each other , and had their prerequisites and capabilities to strive for their own rights against kings , the scenes in which nobles sat with a king negotiating for their own interest emerged , which never happened in China 's 
Compromises and concessions were made mutually instead use of violent means to knock down or replace opponents . 
In this way , through making various contracts , rights were continuously transferred to nobles and common people , and they had more and more rights , and kings had fewer and fewer . 
Later , the British Queen had only a status for display , and not any substantial power . 
Democracy was gradually realized in this way ! 
Let 's come back again to compare with ancient China , where every power was concentrated in the hands of emperors ( except Li Shimin ) , and there were almost no nobles . It was very difficult for peasants to be able to sit in front of a negotiation table , joyfully making compromises and concessions on a contract agreed to by both sides while enjoying a cup of tea or a glass of wine . 
Under this circumstance , when the living right was taken away , only violent means could overthrow an existing dynasty and try to replace it . 
Its outcome was the repeated cycle from the peak of the Tang Dynasty to the sick status of the Ming Dynasty . 
Comparing histories between China and the West , we discovered that the contradictions between rulers and the ruled in ancient China were much more intensified than those in ancient Western countries . 
No Western countries had so many continuous peasant uprisings as ancient China had . 
In the Western countries , when differences between ancient royal families and peasants emerged , what nobles and common people thought of first was to settle them through a negotiation path , to obtain more rights gradually by making mutual concessions , and they seldom used violent means . 
Understanding this , when we enter into the 21st century , we can still see those democratic warriors in networks who have inherited the ideology of the absolute power concentration system of the Ming Dynasty , 
and have been poisoned by the virus of the Cultural Revolution that they can say nothing except those words of " Down with or overthrow something . " 
And those concepts are the biggest barrier to democracy , because those people do not understand that negotiation , coordination , and compromise are the most important means and path for realization of democracy . 
Cao Xiaoming : Who is Going to " Pay the Bill " for Enriching Cultural Activities in Rural Areas 
Hou Ze 
The author was lucky to spend this year 's Spring Festival in a rural area of the Mainland , and visited some relatives and friends . 
I was not only influenced by the dense atmosphere of the festival in the Chinese rural area , but also concerned about those boring cultural activities there . 
The author discovered in a village where my relatives lived that this village organized villagers spontaneously to play a drama called " trotting horse lamp " for every Spring Festival in the past . 
The drama is based on figures in the story of The Three Kingdoms . Any adult or child could play a role in the drama , and villagers were not bored at all to watch it a hundred times . 
There were several of this kind of performance teams of " trotting horse lamp " in the whole township . They performed not only in their own villages , but also went to other villages for visits , and exchanged frequently . 
But this village did not organize the performance this year . 
The reason is that just the costumes for " trotting horse lamp " would cost a lot , which were bought in the past through donations from villagers . Now they are too worn out to be taken on . 
Nobody was willing to donate any more , if asking villagers for donations household by household . Other villages in the township had a similar situation . 
The village suddenly became quiet without the " trotting horse lamp . " 
Adults started to play Mahjong . 
Children also began to play cards . 
Villagers said that this festival had no fun . 
The big scene in the countryside is either shooting off fireworks or playing Mahjong during the festival . 
The gambling trend cannot be stopped even though it is prohibited time and again , and is spread even further . Gambling for up to ten thousand Yuan has become a routine game . Especially , big batches of those migrant farmer workers who come back to their hometowns from other areas have played major roles in gambling sites . 
Their hard - earned money from working in other areas for a year is lost in this way . 
Family disputes occurred time and again because of gambling , which sometimes causes tragedies with families broken up and decimated . 
Some farmers said that they gambled not only during festivals but also participated in gambling frequently in slack seasons . 
Nowhere to go if they did not gamble . 
It is too difficult to organize cultural activities and look for " fun " in the countryside . 
Not only are there no facilities and funding , but also nobody organizes them . 
But in this aspect , the practice in Jiangxi is definitely good news for farmers . 
To enrich the cultural life of the farmer masses , the government of Jiangxi Province not only implemented the policy that " the government provides funding for it ; the market operates it ; townships build stages ; and farmers watch dramas " last September , 
but they also arranged at least 60 million Yuan every year for the special fund for rural cultural causes and delivered good - quality cultural products to the rural masses . 
In the beginning of this New Year , it added an additional 40 million Yuan , a total of 100 million Yuan , for the establishment of special funding for the rural cultural cause . 
And also , what this special funding " paid " toward the farmers ' " bill " is quite a good deal : 
Various professional performance organizations are invited to have shows in rural areas , and provide at least four shows for every town each year . 
Movie companies at every level are invited to organize film projection teams to show movies in the countryside , and at least six feature or scientific education movies should be shown for every administrative village each year ; 
Cultural activities with local features participated in by the masses are organized and developed at least two to three times for every township each year . 
It is not difficult for us to see from the " purchase list " that the government does not simply pay the bill , but thinks hard how to use the limited funds in the critical area and deliver a cultural banquet that exceeds its money value to the farmer masses , and has done a big substantial thing for them . 
Now , a lot of farmers are very happy and joyful for immunity from providing " royal grains and state 's tax . " 
If every government can pay the " bill " for enriching cultural activities of the farmer masses as Jiangxi did , it would be another happy thing falling from the sky for farmers . 
And this " happy thing " can not only liberate farmers from the Mahjong table , and make them " active " in cultural activities , but also add bricks and tiles for the construction of the new socialist countryside . 
It Was a False Alarm that a Child of Wang Peirong Was Almost Hijacked 
peirongwangsohu@gmail.com 
It was a false alarm that a child of Wang Peirong was almost hijacked 
The child of Wang Peirong recounted it completely at a little bit after 9 p.m. on the evening of January 24, 2006 : 
The child of Wang Peirong was called off by a gate guard when she was making up missed physics lessons at the Third Middle School of Xuzhou on the morning of January 24, 2006 . 
The guard said to Wang Peirong 's child that three unidentified men had told the gate guard at the Third Middle School that Wang Tianjiao , the child of Wang Peirong , had not gone back home for three days because of discord between her parents . 
Now her mother was missing , and they were leaders from her mother 's work unit , and wanted to enter the Third Middle School and take away Wang Peirong 's child . 
Wang Peirong 's child said : what the three men said was totally untrue . She refused to go with the three men . 
Wang Peirong 's child was not taken away with the help of the gate guard of the Third Middle School . 
Wang Peirong 's child called one of her mother 's leaders at noontime to confirm it . The leader denied that he had sent his men to visit the Third Middle School . 
Wang Peirong 's child obtained a phone number of one of her father 's leaders from her . 
Wang Peirong 's child called her father 's leader . 
Wang Peirong 's child said : three men visited the Third Middle School and wanted to take me away . 
The leader asked : why didn 't you go with them ? 
Wang Peirong 's child said : I would be dead for sure if I went with them . 
Wang Peirong 's child hung up the phone right away after she finished her words . 
Wang Peirong felt that the case was serious after she listened to her child 's description , and reported it to the police . 
The feedback from a public security station on January 25 was that Wang Peirong 's child 's description was basically true . 
The public security station asked the security unit of Kuangda if it had sent those men to look for Wang Peirong 's child ; the response was no . 
The station asked the security unit again , and other units under Kuangda , if they had sent those men to look for Wang Peirong 's child ; their responses also were no . 
Some related department passed on a message to Wang Peirong and her family members through another person , and asked them to pay attention to their security . 
Leaders of some related department in Xuzhou City had paid close attention to the incident after it occurred . 
The possibility of hijacking the child was excluded through an investigation done by the criminal detection unit of the Public Security Bureau of Xuzhou City . 
Wang Peirong thanked leaders of related departments in Xuzhou City and the criminal detection unit of the Public Security Bureau of Xuzhou City . 
This was a false alarm that was probably mainly caused by the gate guard at the Third Middle School . 
Now the criminal detection unit of the Public Security Bureau of Xuzhou City finds out that , on January 24 , three men , including leaders of the work unit of the Physics Institute where Wang Peirong works , called Wang Peirong , but could not find her ( Wang Peirong still does not know what for so far ) . They tried to find Wang Peirong in a hurry and wanted to look for a teacher of Wang Peirong 's child to ask if Wang Peirong 's child was still in Xuzhou or not . 
Heavy talking topic : why corruption has a lower risk but anti - corruption has a higher cost 
http://bbs.people.com.cn/bbs/ReadFile?whichfile=44796&typeid=39 
What a corrupted official cares about is those several related officials who are his superiors in the current cadre and anti - corruption mechanisms , not the masses of people . 
Thus , once he feels that he has successfully deceived or tamed those several officials who can determine his fate , he would boldly do whatever he likes to conduct his great cause for accumulation of wealth through corruption , and could ignore the feelings of the masses of people that are only a few feet away from them . 
On the contrary , if common people who do not have power in their hands take the initiative to oppose corruption , they might bring extremely brutal strikes and retaliation upon themselves , 
or be imposed with political accusations , and end up with failure before achieving any victory . 
Compared with the two sides , corrupted individuals have lower risk , but individuals who oppose corruption have to bear a higher cost .
