Two Laptops Containing Information on Princess Diana Death Investigation Stolen 
London , the 6th (AFP) 
London 's Daily Express has reported that two laptop computers containing material on the probe into Princess Diana 's fatal car crash in Paris in 1997 have been stolen from the office of a former metropolitan police commissioner . 
The report says the theft has given rise to conjecture that the computers may contain confidential material from the investigation headed by former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Stevens . 
However , a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said the computers did not contain any sensitive information or any material linked to the probe . 
Lord Stevens is the chief constable of Northumbria Police in England . His office is located in Newcastle upon Tyne . 
The report said detectives with the Northumbria Police have been investigating two burglaries in the last ten days . 
The first took place on the weekend of January 28 to 29 when the computers and cash were taken . The second burglary took place last week , but without any loss . 
Northumbria Police also said there was no evidence that the two break - ins were linked to Lord Stevens ' work . 
Stevens has been investigating if the princess of Wales ' death was not the result of a straightforward car accident . 
In 2004 , Royal Coroner Burgess ordered further investigation into related evidence . 
Princess Diana died in a car crash in a Paris tunnel on August 31, 1997 . Her lover , Fayed , and a chauffeur were also killed . 
A two - year investigation by French police concluded that the tragedy resulted because the chauffeur , who was drunk and taking prescription drugs , was driving too fast and lost control . 
Both Sides to Sri Lankan Conflict Agree to Talks in Geneva at End of Month 
Colombo , the 7th (AFP) 
Peace broker Norway says the parties to the conflict in Sri Lanka have agreed to hold talks in Geneva on February 22 , ending a three - year deadlock in negotiations seeking to bring a close to decades of bloody ethnic conflict . 
The breakthrough came after Norwegian peace envoy Solheim met in London with the negotiator of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , Balasingham . 
The Norwegian embassy here said in a statement , " The parties to the conflict in Sri Lanka , the government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , have asked Norway to facilitate talks in Geneva from February 22 to 23 . " 
The two - day talks will focus on strengthening a ceasefire that went into effect on February 23, 2002 . The ceasefire has not been fully respected by either party . 
The Norwegian embassy said , " The two parties will discuss how to improve the implementation of the ceasefire agreement . This is also the first time in three years that the parties have negotiated face - to - face at such a high level . " 
Solheim said he will lead Norway 's team at the talks . The four delegates of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam will be led by Balasingham and the delegation of the Sri Lankan government will be led by the health minister . 
He said , " This is a small but important step on the road to peace . We expect the negotiations to be tough . " 
The last face - to - face talks on solving the Sri Lankan ethic conflict were held in Japan in March 2003 , but the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam cancelled what would have been the seventh round of negotiations scheduled in Thailand in April . 
Torino Winter Olympics : North and South Korean delegations enter together at the opening ceremony 
Torino , Italy , the 10th , (AFP) 
At the opening ceremony of the 20th Winter Olympics today in Torino , the delegations of Cold War foes South and North Korea entered together with hands held . 
South Korean female speed skater Bora Lee and North Korean male figure skater Han Jong - in , the respective bearers of the two countries ' flags , led the North and South Korean delegations into the stadium of the Winter Olympics . 
This was the first joint march by North and South Korean Olympic delegations in a Winter Olympics . 
In a reflection of the rapprochement between the two sides in recent years , delegations from North and South Korea marched together at the Summer Olympics in Sydney in 2000 and Athens in 2004 . 
North Korea did not participate in the 19th Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City in the US . 
The Korean peninsula divided into capitalist South Korea and communist North Korea in 1948 . The two sides fought each other in the Korean War from 1950 to 1953 . 
Relations between North and South Korea have improved since a peace summit between their leaders in 2000 . 
In line with tradition , the Greek delegation was the first to appear in the stadium . Of the eighty countries participating in the competition , North and South Korea were the 22nd and 23rd to enter the stadium . 
The delegation from the host country , Italy , was the last to enter . When the Italian delegation entered the stadium , the stadium immediately broke into enthusiastic cheering and waves of applause . 
Hoffman Once Mired in Drugs , But Early Awakening Enabled Him to Launch Acting Career 
New York , the 16th (AFP) 
The recognized favorite to take home this year 's Oscar for best actor , Philip Seymour Hoffman , the male lead in Capote : In Cold Blood , has revealed that he was mired in drugs and alcohol in his untamed youth . Fortunately , he later succeeded in becoming sober , after which he was able to launch his successful acting career . 
Hoffman , speaking in an interview on CBS ' news magazine 60 Minutes , said that during that period he would use any means to obtain drugs and alcohol . 
At the time he was in his early twenties and had recently graduated from New York University 's drama department and entered the colorful society . Life each day was fast - paced as a whirlwind and it finally resulted in him losing his equilibrium and going out of control . 
At 22 , he went into rehab , where giving up his drinking and drug habit was the most terrifying experience of his life . 
At next month 's Oscar Award ceremony , Hoffman , who interprets the American writer Capote in the film Capote : In Cold Blood , is regarded as having the best chance to take the award for best male lead . 
His skillful acting has previously received affirmation and has been recognized with several awards , including a Golden Globe award for best male lead . 
The 38 - year - old actor said during the interview that if he had not made up his mind before he became famous to give up his bad habits he might not have received an Oscar nomination . 
He said he admires those beautiful actors who suddenly find fame and fortune at the age of 19 . 
Public Anxiety as Bird Flu Footprint Expands across Europe , Nigeria 
Brussels , the 16th (AFP) 
The unrelenting advance of bird flu across Europe is causing anxiety among the public . 
The European Commission (EC) approved the establishment of " buffer zones " which would cover entire areas of infected countries and in which trade and transport of poultry products would be prohibited . 
In Africa , where the lethal H5N1 strain of the virus was discovered eight days ago in Nigeria , the disease has continued spread to more poultry farms and showed signs of having crossed the northern border into Niger . 
Egyptian officials are also investigating the sudden unexplained death of a batch of chickens in a poultry farm , raising concerns that the virus may continue to spread . 
The virus has influenced Europe 's poultry markets , where sales have plummeted . The European Commission reiterated that there was no need for panic . 
EU health and food commissioner , Kyprianou , said , " It is understandable that the public is concerned , but they need not be unduly alarmed . " 
Following provisions for three - kilometer protection zones and ten - kilometer surveillance zones around virus outbreak points , the European Commission also issued a regulation that will turn entire regions where the virus is found into " buffer zones " . 
An EU official wishing to remain anonymous said that everybody was very tense and that from morning to night they were handling news coming in from areas all over Europe where it was suspected that the epidemic had erupted . 
In Europe , traces of the H5N1 virus have already appeared in Austria , Bulgaria , Croatia , Germany , Greece , Italy , Romania , Slovenia , Ukraine and the European part of Russia . Almost all cases have appeared in wild swans . 
Romania discovered its thirty - first case on the 16th . New cases have also been discovered in Slovenia , Austria and Greece , as well as on the German island of Ruegan . 
The bird flu virus was found on the bodies of two ducks in southern Italy , the first animals in Europe other than swans to be infected with the H5N1 virus . 
EU officials are now worried about the return of migrating birds from Africa . 
The Nigerian government has revved up its drive to stop the African continent 's virus from spreading to humans . 
The Nigerian government announced that all birds found within a five - kilometer radius of infected poultry farms would be culled regardless of whether they had been threatened by bird flu . 
Authorities in neighboring Niger announced a state of alert and a four-million - dollar emergency plan to monitor the border with Nigeria . 
A new national crisis committee said they had received reports that nearly 400 poultry had died at Magaria , near the loosely guarded frontier . 
We now turn our attention once again to the Iranian nuclear issue . 
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed on the 6th that the Iranian government had sent a letter to the IAEA requiring the removal before the middle of the month of all devices monitoring Iranian nuclear facilities . 
Due to the IAEA 's decision to report the Iranian nuclear issue to the UN Security Council , Iran has declared a halt to all supportive and cooperative measures taken in regards to the nuclear issue and said it would no longer authorize the IAEA to make surprise checks of its nuclear facilities . 
Addressing the current tension over the Iranian nuclear issue , Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said in Athens , Greece that that Russian - Iranian cooperation was ongoing . 
And that it would become the motive force for a solution to the Iranian nuclear issue . 
On the same day , a Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman said that Russia 's proposal to Iran about setting up a joint venture in Russia for enriching uranium was still valid . 
The two sides may discuss the issue next week . 
The same day , US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Lugar said at UN headquarters in New York that the US does not approve of an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities . 
Recently , Israeli defense experts were reported as saying that , if necessary , the Israeli air force may heavily damage Iran 's nuclear facilities . 
According to Xinhua News Agency £ ¬ Russian Vice Foreign Minister Kyslyak said on the 7th that Russia is willing to cooperate with Iran on the nuclear issue and help Iran obtain lawful power for the peaceful development of nuclear energy . 
Kyslyak said that Russia 's proposal about launching a joint venture for enriching uranium with Iran is still open . 
Russia hopes to consult with Iran regarding the issue soon . 
In late December last year , Russia delivered a proposal to Iran regarding the establishment of a joint venture for enriching uranium in Russia . 
Both the EU and the US agreed that the plan was an acceptable compromise . 
But Iran wants Russia to continue to revise the original plan . 
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman Kong Quan said on the 7th that although the IAEA reported the Iranian nuclear issue to the UN Security Council , the organization 's responsibility for settling the issue has not been passed on to the Security Council . 
Therefore , the parties concerned should still try to break the deadlock over the issue within the framework of IAEA . 
Under an IAEA resolution , IAEA Director General El Baradei will deliver a report on the Iranian nuclear issue to the Security Council in March . 
The Security Council will make a final decision after evaluating the report . 
We believe that such a resolution , it talks about requiring the Iranians ... well ... being able to implement the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and honor their commitments . Besides , it does not deliver the issue or pass it on to the Security Council . 
Recently , China has been seeking a plan for the peaceful resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomatic channels . 
Kong Quan said that on February 1 , Zhang Yan , Director of the Department of Armament Control for China 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs , met in Tehran with Ali Larijani , Secretary of Iran 's Supreme National Security Council and Iran 's chief nuclear negotiator , for talks on the Iranian nuclear issue . 
China hopes that Iran should take full note of the concern of the international community and create conditions for the peaceful solution of the Iranian nuclear issue . 
A solution for the Iranian nuclear issue within IAEA framework is not only in the interest of China . We firmly believe that it is also in the interest of all parties . 
Therefore , we again appeal to the concerned parties in the international community not to abandon diplomatic efforts in respect to the issue . 
Hamas , which is in the process of organizing a new Palestine autonomous government , officially announced that , with the exception of choice for prime minister , the list of cabinet members in the new government is essentially in order . 
This triggered speculations among outsiders regarding the choice for the prime minister . 
On the 8th , a senior Hamas official revealed to the Associated Press that Hamas intends to nominate Al - Khudairi , board chairman of Gaza 's Islamic University ( and a merchant ) , as prime minister of the new autonomous government , but the nomination has not yet been formally delivered to Abbas . 
With the support of Hamas , 50 - year - old Al - Khudairi took part in the election of Palestinian Legislative Council held last month in the capacity of independent candidate . 
Al - Khudairi has never mentioned violence or anti - Israeli content in his open speeches . 
But he once indicated that Palestine was in need of internal reform . 
A senior delegation from Hamas is now visiting Cairo to discuss with Egypt issues related to the formation of a new Palestinian government by Hamas . 
Khaled Mashaal , a delegation member , told the press on the 8th that although the international community and some Arab countries have been exerting constant pressure , the Palestinian government formed under the leadership of Hamas will not recognize Israel . 
At the same time , Mashaal also warned Abbas in his speech not to take the liberty of changing the structure of the Palestinian leadership without first consulting with Hamas . 
Analysts believe that this is a response to the intention of Abbas to appoint Interior Minister Nasser Yousef as deputy commander of the security troops . 
In reply to questions about the establishment of a new Palestinian autonomous government , Mashaal refused to confirm the news that Hamas plans to nominate Al - Khudairi , board chairman of the Islamic University in Gaza ( and merchant ) as prime minister . 
" The candidate for prime minister has not been decided yet , " Mashaal said . 
Prior to Meshaal 's reiteration of the refusal to recognize Israel , another Hamas political leader , Marzuk , said in an Egyptian TV interview that Hamas would never recognize the legitimate status of Israel , but the new government would contact Israel in various fields , for it 's one thing not to recognize Israel and it 's another to contact with it . 
Apart from the new and old hatreds between the three Hamas candidates for prime minister and Israel , the issue of territory ... eh ... has always been a difficult problem in Palestine - Israeli relations . 
Acting Israeli Prime Minister Olmert said on the 7th in an interview with Israeli TV II that Israel must be separated from Palestine through the delimitation of permanent borders . 
This means that Israel will have to pull out from part of the territory on the west bank of the Jordan River . 
However , Olmert stressed that Israel would keep its control over large Jewish settlements on the west bank of the Jordan River and the river valley and maintain the integrity of Jerusalem .

The remains of three Chinese engineers killed in an attack in Pakistan left Karachi at 7 p.m. local time today to be repatriated on a special flight by the Pakistani air force . 
Let 's watch a report by this station 's reporter in Pakistan , Tao Ye . 
The remains of the three Chinese engineers killed on the 15th near Karachi in Pakistan were repatriated early on the 17th from Faisal Air Force Base in Karachi , Pakistan .

Ambassador Zhang Chunxiang led all personnel present in bowing three times toward the three coffins . 
Afterwards , an honor guard of Pakistani soldiers slowly carried the three coffins into a special plane provided by Pakistan . 
The plane made a circle in the sky above the Chinese and Pakistanis present with me and , in the end , we watched as our fallen Chinese compatriots flew away . 
The special flight departed from the airport at approximately 7:20 a.m. 
The plane will make a short stop in Pakistan 's capital , Islamabad . 
Senior Pakistani officials will board the plane , which will then fly directly from Islamabad to Hefei , China on the same day .

It is estimated that the special plane transporting the remains of the victims will arrive in Hefei at about 10:00 p.m. this evening . 
We will now connect to the reporter at Hefei 's Luogang Airport , Li Guangyu . 
Hello , Li Guangyu . Can you tell us the situation there where you are ? 
Hello , Anchorman . 
Actually , it 's still not clear what time the plane will land at the airport here . 
What we know as of now is that at 5:30 this afternoon the plane from Pakistan landed at Urumqi Airport and then flew on from Urumqi toward Hefei . 
It 's been estimated that it will arrive at eleven or twelve o'clock tonight . 
Regarding what kind of ceremony will actually be held when their remains arrive tonight and who will be in attendance , uh , it is not very clear at this time . 
We now know that this afternoon individuals from the provincial government and the Cement Research Institute held a ... held a coordination meeting , eh , to coordinate some of tonight 's activities . 
Eh , the unit is now , eh , in these last two days the cement institute , uh , led by the chairman of the labor union , has set up a support team which has been here all along offering support to the victims ' families . 
As for the actual amount of compensation , no precise response has been confirmed as of yet . 
Uh , we do know that there is one insurance policy against accidental injury for four-hundred thousand . 
Um , with regards to compensation , currently the family members have not been in direct contact with the insurance company . Instead , it will be the work unit that will carry out negotiations with the compensation company regarding , uh , the , uh , with the insurance company regarding compensation . 
Eh , currently that is what we understand regarding the situation . 
Okay , thank you Mr. Li Guangyu for the on - site report . 
In addition , this afternoon the survivors of the 2 - 15 terrorist attack , Yuan Fengyu , Xue Qijun , and Yang Wei , as well as a total of eleven other employees of the Hefei Cement Research Institute assigned to Pakistan 's Balochistan boarded a plane to return to Hefei . 
When the plane carrying the three survivors and eleven other workers arrived in Hefei , the people waiting out the airport let out a long sigh of relief . 
We felt very gratified that they were able to return safely . 
Our county is also very ( ( ) ) , and has been paying close attention to the affair . 
Following the incident , appropriate shelter was organized for them .

Officials from Anwei Province and the China National Building Materials Group were at the airport to greet them and they expressed their condolences to the eleven workers .

They expressed an enthusiastic welcome to the other eleven comrades that today were able to safely return to the motherland . 
In a related aspect , they explained that compensation for the victims and efforts to console their families were currently in progress . 
Even though the remains of the three fallen Chinese engineers have left for China , Pakistan 's investigation into the attack was still ongoing . 
Only one hour ago , at two o'clock Beijing time , Pakistan police met with staff from the Chinese embassy in Pakistan to brief the Chinese on progress in the investigation into the incident . 
We will now connect to this station 's reporter in Pakistan , Tao Ye . 
Hello , Tao Ye . 
Yes , hello . ( ( ) ) 
Okay . 
In the meeting that was just held .... 
( ( ) ) 
In the briefing just held , what progress in the investigation was explained ? 
Uh , okay . 
As you said , only an hour ago , the police chief from Pakistan 's Balochistan province , which is the province where the incident occurred , his name is Yaqoob , he visited the China 's [ lu ba ] consulate - general in Karachi to brief our ambassador to Pakistan , and also the consul general , on the status of the investigation by Pakistani police over the last two days into the incident . 
In his briefing , he concisely explained the , uh , primary clues and targets the Pakistani police had in tracking down the assailants . 
Eh , they maintain that the incident was probably the act of outsiders but that they surely had ties with some local residents . 
Well , eh , they are now focusing on , uh , employees of the company for which the Chinese engineers worked . 
They figure that these people might have fed information to the assailants and provided intelligence ; for example , intelligence regarding the times the Chinese engineers departed and arrived at various locations . 
In addition , they might have provided the assailants cover . 
So these various aspects are what the police are currently focusing on . 
According to the police chief , after two days of investigation they have questioned more than fifty people . 
Presently , the scope of the investigation is gradually shrinking . 
In addition , um , after the briefing was over , the police chief and other police officials also at ... also went to the memorial hall set up in our country 's consulate - general in Karachi to pay their respects to the three victims . 
Uh , furthermore , something else of interest occurred . A group called the Balochistan Liberation Army ( ( ) ) has claimed responsibility for the incident , but this news has not yet been confirmed by Pakistani , uh , authorities . 
Uh , in responding to questions from this station 's reporters regarding the incident , the police chief said that the % pw , the terrorist group is actually an extremely loose network that does not have an intact organization . 
And , eh , a lot of people become members of the group just by calling themselves members . 
Uh , so , as far as the Pakistani authorities are concerned , they , uh , are still focusing the investigation on several actual individuals . 
As for the group , uh , they are not regarding it as an especially key aspect . 
Okay . 
Okay , Tao Ye . 
( ( ) ) 
Um , we will continue to pay close attention to the status of the investigation into the matter . 
Thank you Tao Ye for your on - site report . 
Danish Prime Minister Rasmussen held a news conference on Tuesday at the prime minister 's residence . 
He said : that the incident involving cartoons of Islam 's founding prophet Mohammed had developed to such a point that it was being used by extremists . 
He ( ( said ) ) : Denmark respects all faiths and urges , every person has equal rights , uh , and at the same time urges Muslims to practice restraint and not to resort to violence . 
At 4:30 p.m. on the 7th at the residence of the Danish prime minister , Prime Minister Rasmussen and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs convened a news conference . 
Rasmussen said . 
The incident , which has led to violent incidents at some European embassies , is not a matter between Muslim countries and Denmark alone . 
Receiving widespread international support in this difficult situation has been very important to the government and people of Denmark . 
We have formed an alliance with France . 
Various organizations of other European countries and the US in Moslem countries are now working together closely . 
Just a few minutes earlier , US President Bush had telephoned . 
During the telephone call , he expressed support and solidarity with Denmark . 
Rasmussen said : We still believe that dialogue and tolerance , not violence , are the means to resolve this incident . 
We emphasize that freedom , democracy and respect for faiths are precious values . 
Today , we urge the people of all Moslem countries to work together to quell the spread of this violent situation . 
We need to resolve this issue through dialogue , not violence . 
We are today facing a growing international situation . 
We are seeing Danish flags being burned and Danish embassies being wrecked . 
We are seeing the Danish being viewed as an intolerant people and as enemies of Islam . 
This is false . 
Extremists and radicals are using a contradiction between cultures to escalate the situation . 
Rasmussen emphasized : Denmark and the Danish people are not enemies of Islam or any other religion . 
For generations , Danes have transcended politics in their fight for human rights , democracy and freedom . 
We continue to carry out that struggle . 
It is a part of Denmark 's history and a fundamental part of our society today . 
Denmark is one of the world 's most tolerant and open societies . 
We respect all religions . 
We prohibit violence . 
We believe in equal rights for all people .

Iranian extremists angry at the publication of cartoons of Mohammed once again attacked the Danish embassy in Tehran on Tuesday and threw Molotov cocktails . 
At the same time , an Iranian state - run paper sought revenge by organizing a contest for cartoons depicting Nazis slaughtering Jews . 
The US denounced the initiative as an arrogant attempt to take advantage of the situation to extend the consistent anti - Israeli stance of Iranian President Ahmadinejad . 
Roughly twenty to thirty protestors climbed an enclosure to enter the compound of the Danish embassy in Iran . 
A crowd of roughly three hundred outside also threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at the building . 
The day before , student members of an Iranian hard - line militia group led hundreds of protesters in an attack on the Danish and Austrian embassies in Tehran . 
The cartoons that gave rise to the controversy were first published in the Danish newspaper Jyllands - Posten last September . 
Newspapers in other European countries and three Arab papers also carried the images . 
Seeking revenge , Iran 's best - selling newspaper , the Hamshahri daily , announced recently that it would hold a contest for cartoons depicting Nazi Germany 's slaughter of Jews . 
This move was denounced by the US and other countries . 
US State Department Spokesperson McCormack said he said that the initiative by Iran 's largest - selling paper Hamshahri as an extension of the virulent anti - Israeli rhetoric of Iranian President Ahmadinejad . 
McCormack reiterated US support for freedom of speech throughout the world , including in Iran . 
But he saw no comparison between Hamshahri 's contest and the cartoons of Mohammed published in the Danish media . 
McCormack said : I don 't think anybody would draw any equivalences between freedom of the press in Iran and freedom of the press in Western Europe and the US . 
Ahmadinejad has said that the Holocaust was a myth and called for Israel to be wiped of the map . This drew widespread criticism from the US and other countries . 
McCormack said : Hamshahri is funded and printed by Tehran 's conservative municipal government . 
The holding of a cartoon contest on this occasion is in no way a coincidence . 
Following the launch on February 20 by lawyer Gao Zhisheng of a national ten - city 24 - hour hunger strike and campaign of resistance against persecution by the Chinese Communist Party , in recent days another 170 Shanghai whistle - blowers collectively signed to express a willingness to participate in the hunger strike campaign for human rights . 
They also said that they will continue to publicly announce how many signature have been obtained for the second batch of participants and how many people with participate . 
Next , please watch this station 's investigation report . 
We 've learned that Shanghai 's home prices , under the government 's intentional manipulation , are now among the highest in the world . 
Many government agencies seek out ways to force the demolition of resident 's homes that are located in up - market sectors without giving reasonable compensation . 
The common people that experience the painful loss of their homes because they were coerced into demolishing them suddenly don 't have any income to rely on . 
There isn 't enough money for children 's tuition , so they don 't dare go to school . 
For several years now , the vast majority of people who appeal to higher authorities have been repaid with years of reeducation through labor . 
Statistics show that Shanghai is the region in China with the greatest number of appeals to higher authorities . 
Han Zhongming originally had a store , but he was forced to tear it down . His home was also resold at a profit . 
Because he appealed to higher authorities , he was put under house arrest by the authorities and even detained . 
He protested by threatening to leap off a building , cut his wrists and other methods until in recent days he was finally released . 
Chen Enjuan 's store was also forcibly demolished by the government . 
Government - hired thugs hauled the three members of her family out of the house and used a forklift to completely demolish the house along with the furniture . 
Because she appealed to higher authorities , she was subjected to almost two years of reeducation through labor . 
Besides resistance against the government 's ruffian tactics , Chen Enjuan spoke about her support for the hunger strike campaign , . 
Attorney Gao gave us a lot of legal help , help that was given very selflessly . 
The human right we are now demanding is democracy , because we are also thinking about the next generation . 
We of the last generation have already suffered enough , so we are fighting in order that the next generation will not undergo persecution . Therefore , we need to participate in the human rights campaign and we cannot give up . 
A report by the Geneva - based human rights organization Center on Housing Rights and Evictions says : China has been listed as one of the world countries that most violates housing rights . 
This is covered and reported by New Tang Dynasty reporter Wang Xin and special reporter Gu Qing 'er . 
In regards to Attorney Gao Zhisheng 's launching of a new series of hunger strike actions in support of human rights , on February 15 in Hong Kong , Taiwan , Calgary in Canada and the Greater Philadelphia region in the US , several figures from the democracy movement as well as the general public continued to express their approval and support in various ways . 
Next is a news brief by this station 's reporter . 
The 24 - hour ten - city national hunger - strike campaign launched by Attorney Gao Zhisheng to protest the tyranny of the Chinese Communist Party begins on February 24 . A signature campaign has been held in the streets of Hong Kong . 
Legco Member Leung Kwok - hung , who supports Attorney Gao Zhisheng 's hunger strike campaign , said that the Communist authorities ' indiscriminate arrest of human rights figures in recent days was a very dangerous signal that this government is categorically not based on popular will . 
That day was also the day of the week that Legco Member Attorney Ho Chun - yan , who is currently preparing to establish a human rights concern group , holds his weekly one - day hunger strike .

On February 17 , the Indian border militia stepped up patrols of the border with Nepal . 
Because of the fear that extreme Maoists who have staged evermore frequent rebellions in recent months will infiltrate the border , border troops and militiamen guarding the 200km - long Indian - Nepalese border in Darjeeling County have been reinforced by three battalions . 
In Nepal 's north lay the Himalayas . 
The other three sides border India , with the border measuring a total of 1,477 km . 
Maoist rebels often sneak into Indian border villages to receive weapons from local allied factions and drug traffickers . 
Deputy Inspector [ Shanaya ] of the border troops in the [ Lanidanjia ] region said they would increase the existing 26 battalions to 36 in order facilitate patrolling of the 100km borderline between Darjeeling County and West Sikkim . 
[ Shanaya ] said it had been reported that Indian Kamtapur Liberation Organization had joined forces with the Maoist rebels in the counties of Jhapa and Ilam in east Nepal . 
The border troops will set up 18 border observation posts to further strengthen border security . 
Trained police dogs will accompany the border troops on their patrols to detect explosives and drugs . 
Border officials have also begun to thoroughly check all vehicles and people passing through sensitive border inspection stations . 
India is worried that these people may ally with leftwing Indian extremists . 
Nepal is one of the world 's poorest countries . 
Insurgences by Maoist rebels have wrecked the entire national economy and forced tens of thousands of residents to flee from their homes . 
On Friday , Japan 's Cabinet Office released GDP data for the 4th quarter of 2005 . 
After price adjustment , actual growth in GDP in the October - December quarter was up 1.4 % from the previous quarter , registering a growth rate that was 1.2 % higher than expected . 
The primary reasons are strong domestic demand and rising exports to major countries , such as China and the United States . This is a sign of a sustained economic recovery . 
This is the fourth quarter in a row that Japan has witnessed economic growth and the highest growth rate since the first and third quarters of 2005 . It is primarily due to individual spending , capital expenditure and strong exports . 
In addition , Japan 's central bank will end in April its extremely loose currency policy of the past five years , thereby encouraging the financial market 's expectations for an economic upturn . 
In October through December , nongovernmental consumption increased by 0.8 % thanks to a moderate improvement in the unemployment rate and wages . 
The NIKKEI climbed after the release of the GDP figures , but was down 0.74 % at the close of the morning session . 
Japanese Yen fell after a short - lived appreciation and transaction prices hovered around 118.15 yen to 1 USD .

Immediately following the decision by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to refer the Iranian nuclear issue to the UN Security Council , Iran has reiterated that ... eh ... there is no room for negotiations with the US , one of the promoters of the decision . 
Well ... an Iranian government spokesman said on Monday that the policy Iran has maintained to date in regards to relations with the US is not to engage in discussion or negotiation . 
He said the west has committed a grave error in referring the nuclear issue to the Security Council in an obvious attempt to block the development of Iran . 
Iran said on Monday that ... eh ... it would discontinue cooperation with IAEA , resume the extraction of enriched uranium and prohibit spot checks of its nuclear facilities . 
So , on this issue , Iran 's current attitude is pretty hard - line , ut the attitude of the United States is even more hard - line . 
Eh ... US Defense Secretary Rumsfeld has repeatedly said that ... eh ... the use of force would not be ruled out in regard to this issue . 
Well ... now there are rumors that the US military is putting such a plan into effect . 
They are developing a super bomb , called the " Mother of All Bombs " . 
Eh ... once the Department of Defense gives the go - ahead , this super bomb will be used to blast Iran . 
So , how big exactly is this Mother of All Bombs ? 
It has been said that , in terms of weight alone , the bomb weighs 30,000 pounds , equal to the weight of a double - deck bus . Also , its bulk is massive . 
Such a super bomb has been developed mainly to bombard certain underground facilities of Iran . 
Because of its massive penetrating power , it can penetrate concrete and also steel plate . It can roughly create a pit that is half a mile in radius and 60 feet deep , destroying several underground buildings and facilities . 
So it now seems that in this respect the US has really begun to hone its sword or make the bomb . 
Rumsfeld ... eh ... said that , on this issue ... no means would be excluded as a solution to the Iranian nuclear issue and a resort to force had been put on the table . 
Elsewhere , irrespective of the continuous escalation of the Iranian nuclear issue , an Iranian official in China said in an interview with this station that Iran actually would still work with the international community by persisting in peaceful negotiation ... eh ... in the hope of easing the crisis . 
But he also added that Iran would adjust the details of cooperation with Russia on a nuclear project . 
As for the second round of negotiations with Russia regarding the enriched uranium cooperation project scheduled for February 16 , the Iranians said that the negotiations would go on as planned , though it was emphasized that the changes that have taken place so far will make it necessary to adjust the content of the negotiations . 
Russia has previously been a steady supporter of Iran 's peaceful utilization of nuclear energy and had said that it would remain stick to its position that the Iranian nuclear issue should not be referred to the Security Council . 
But , as we can see now , they have agreed to referring the Iranian nuclear issue to the UN Security Council . 
Given this new development , as a result we may make some changes to the policy we agreed on with Russia . 
Before the UN Security Council ultimately decides in March whether to impose economic and political sanctions , Iran will advocate continuous negotiations with related international organizations and , in the meantime , remains willing to cooperate with the international community to ease the current crisis . 
We stress the point that , for purpose of its own economic growth and national construction , Iran will not abandon the right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy . 
Iran has not violated any related international laws . We hope that the United States too will understand this . 
The Iranian nuclear issue is completely different from the Afghanistan and Iraqi issues . 
I think the US is pretty clear about that itself . 
As for the so - called military strike , we haven 't seen any clear - cut expression of attitude on the part of the United States . 
We don 't want to see the further escalation of the crisis . 
Although we also make a point of using peaceful negotiation , we will not bow to pressure . 
Additionally , ( ( A ge bi ) ) also said that he hoped China would continue on the basis of its existing standpoint to cooperate with Iran . 
This is Hu Lin ( ( of Phoenix TV ) ) reporting from Beijing . 
Let 's first take a look at today 's headlines . 
The US northeast states and the Atlantic coast region were buffeted by the winter 's first snowstorm this morning . 
Snow accumulation in some regions exceeds 60 centimeters 
Several airports were forced to close . 
More than two-thousand flights have been cancelled . 
And as for New York , it is the first time in history that it has seen such heavy snowfall . 
Uh , this is the second largest snowfall in recorded history . 
Let 's take a look at the actual situation . 
Residents of New York City woke up Sunday morning to find themselves in a world of white . 
Outdoors , most buildings and streets were covered with a thick coat of snow . 
New York 's Central Park recorded 57.9 cm of snowfall . 
This is the second largest snowfall on record in the history of New York City . 
New York 's Mayor Bloomberg said : This was a frightening snowstorm . 
Out of safety considerations , he urged people to stay in their homes and not to go outside . 
Most flights from New York City 's three airports have to be cancelled . 
Some of them won 't be resumed until Monday . 
The capital Washington is also experiencing a snowstorm , with snowfall having exceeded 50 cm . 
Grass and trees have all been draped in white attire . 
But President Bush still attended a church service as usual . 
Many of the city 's resident have also stepped outside their homes in order to take in the beautiful winter scenery and profit from chance to play in the snow . 
The National Weather Service 's radars show snowfall stretching from eastern Virginia through to Maine . 
In New Jersey , New York 's Long Island , Connecticut and Maryland , power to homes and businesses was also cut following the snowstorm . 
It is estimated that more than one-hundred and fifty thousand users are without power . 
Large areas of Europe are also under the influence of a snowstorm . 
The state of Bavaria in southern Germany has mobilized thousands of firefighters and soldiers to work with police and volunteers in clearing snowfall from rooftops and roads . 
The Deggendorf region in eastern Bavaria is still under a state of emergency after several days of heavy snow . 
Some small villages have lost contact with the outside world . 
A roof collapsed under heavy snow in Bad Reichenhall in the state of Bavaria last month , killing fifteen people . 
This is a news brief by Phoenix Satellite Television . 
New York was of course among the cities affected in the northeast region of the US that was hit by the blizzard . 
For the local situation , we will immediately connect with this station 's reporter in New York , Luo Xiaoying . 
Hello , Xiaoying . 
Hello , Xiaonan . 
Hi . 
You 've just been hit with so much snow , so what is the situation actually like there ? 
I hear that power has even been cut to some areas . 
What areas have been affected ? 
Yes , that 's right . 
In fact , the ... the area covered by the blizzard is extremely large . 
I 'm really happy to tell you that now we have finally seen the end of the blizzard . 
Although the , the snowstorm was very violent , it didn 't cause any serious injuries or fatalities . 
Many states in the area hit in the eastern US were affected : Maryland received 21 inches of snowfall ; Pennsylvania got 19 inches ; and the New York - New Jersey area was at more than 24 inches . 
Snowflakes could be seen from Virginia to Maine , and even in Tennessee . 
So , uh , as you just said , the , it resulted in power outages in many locations in the Washington region and Baltimore . 
The total ... total number of households affected by the power outage is approximately ten thousand or so . 
New York is okay . The power outage , uh , power supply in the Manhattan area of New York City is normal . There are just some power outages in the Long Island area . 
Rhode Island has declared a state of emergency . 
Only snowplows and rescue vehicles such as ambulances are able to circulate on the roads . 
As for traffic and transportation , relatively early on the New York , uh , area 's three large airports were closed . 
But , uh , we learned toward the evening that there appeared to be some movement toward resuming activities at Newark Airport in New Jersey and LaGuardia Airport in New York . 
So there are some people who estimate that in a few hours from now those airports will open . 
Delta Airlines , for example , has announced that all flights to places like Washington , Philadelphia , Boston , Baltimore and the state of Connecticut have been grounded until Monday . 
Reagan Airport in Washington DC has already been opened . 
Buses in the New York - New Jersey area are currently not running . 
Trains are also operating at reduced frequency . 
It , uh , it is now Sunday in New York . It is also the Lantern Festival . 
And as for we Chinese , normally on the Lantern Festival some local Chinese communities have Lantern Festival activities , but these have all had to be cancelled . 
Likewise , most of the activities that the people of New York normally take part in on Sunday have for the most part been cancelled . And , uh , no one is going outside , that is , they are all staying in their homes . 
Um . 
What is giving everybody a headache now is how to get to work on Monday . 
The snow removal , or rather the accumulated snow could cause some flooding . 
So the , uh , governments of the areas in the US being affected are now studying how to cope with the rush of people heading to work on Monday , as well as the rush of automobiles . 
Xiaonan . 
Okay . 
Thank you Xiaoying for this latest report issued from the US . 
Since there is nothing to be done , you might as well take a while to peacefully enjoy the beautiful snowscape . 
Now let 's look at some news items about Japan . 
Koizumi has been contemplating upgrading the Japan Defense Agency to a Ministry so as to build up Japan 's military muscle . 
But , heated debates erupted during the process , which ran into one obstacle after another . 
Recently , a scandal surfaced involving tenders for engineering projects offered by the Defense Facilities Administration Agency , an institution under the Defense Agency . As a result , some former and current officials have been arrested by the authorities . 
Therefore , many people advised Koizumi to be careful in his move to upgrade the agency to a ministry . 
And recently , Koizumi said that he had temporarily put the plan on the shelf rather then refer it to the parliament for review . 
And he also hopes that the two parties in power can discuss the issue carefully and , eh , continue their consultations . 
Elsewhere , here is some other news . If you go to Japan , there is now a new rule . 
That is , Japan plans to , stipulates that most of tourists arriving in Japan must have their fingerprints and photos taken . 
The move aims to prevent some unsafe individuals from entering Japan 's borders and also prevent illegal immigration . 
Er , so , it will probably be more troublesome going to Japan now . 
Of course , recently there was one good news in Japan . 
That is , Princess Kiko , wife of the second son of Japanese emperor , is pregnant . 
This development has caused many Japanese to hope that she will give birth to a boy who will be heir to the throne . 
But , she also threw the imperial family , which has always stayed relatively quiet , into a commotion . 
Uh , in fact , Kiko is now of course a mature pregnant mother and she has all along been thought to be content with a family of four . 
Being pregnant again at such an age , many people cannot help conjecturing that , uh , a fraternal scramble for the throne may arise in the imperial household . 
Of course , many people are taking delight in talking about this conspiracy theory . 
To explain this , one must go back to a few years ago . 
Eh , it 's like this . At that time , in 2002 , because the wife of Crown Prince Naruhito , contracted depression , the imperial household did not place too much hope on them at the time and instead turned to the second prince , Fumihito , whom they put pressure on . 
At the time , Fumihito did not do much in response . 
But , by 2004 , the contradiction intensified somewhat after Naruhito , uh , out of his care for his wife , reproached the imperial family on public occasions . 
It is said that the imperial family were furious and asked his peer , Prince Fumihito to stand out and rebut his elder brother , accusing him of showing disrespect for the imperial family and doting upon his wife . 
The brothers have been in discord from then on . 
Now , if Prince Fumihito gives birth to a boy , the dominant role they play will become a pillar of the imperial household 
and the East Palace , i.e . the crown prince will surely fall out of favor . 
Eh , this is why many people say that , if things go on like this , the impact on the imperial household and the Japanese society will be tremendous . 
United Nations Secretary General Annan visited the White House on Monday to meet with US President Bush . 
In response to Iran 's announcement that it was postponing nuclear talks with Russia , Annan urged Iran to halt nuclear activity as quickly as possible and to resolve the issue through negotiations and not confrontation . 
Elsewhere , news sources have reported that the US Department of Defense has actually already begun in earnest to devise plans for bombing Iran as a last resort in case diplomatic efforts fail . 
Originally , outside sources believed that Bush and Annan would discuss the possibility of the UN Security Council imposing sanctions on Iran , but the two did not make any announcement in that regard following the meeting . 
Bush and Annan both reiterated that they hoped to resolve the Iran nuclear issue through negotiation . 
Annan expressed concern over Iran 's initiation of uranium enrichment activities and its decision to postpone nuclear talks with Russia . 
The same day , US media reported , that Pentagon military strategists had begun seriously planning for military action against Iran so that if diplomatic efforts fails the US will use military methods to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons . 
Reports say that the US Central Command has started pinpointing attack targets . 
The attack could possibly be by submarine - launched ballistic missile or B2 bombers . 
On Monday , Annan urged all sides not to take actions that will intensify the crisis . 
According to the analysis of some military experts , Iran could be capable of manufacturing a nuclear weapon within two years . 
Furthermore , more than two years remain in Bush 's second term . 
He will endeavor to resolve the Iran nuclear issue before the end of his term , regardless of whether peaceful or military methods are used . 
This is reported from Washington by Mou Naiqian of Phoenix Satellite TV . 
On the 13th , Iranian President Ahmadinejad said that large superpower states that use their nuclear weapons to threaten other countries will disappear . 
Ahmadinejad was meeting with the diplomatic envoys of various countries to Tehran on the occasion of the commemoration of the 27th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic revolution . 
He said the arms race between countries and the fight to achieve hegemony will not bear fruit . 
The hunger of the large superpowers will never be satisfied and they even go as far as to use nuclear weapons to threaten other countries . 
But he said that the large superpower countries that rely on nuclear weapons to threaten other countries will disappear . 
The day when mankind will have lasting peace and stability is close at hand . 
So it can be seen that now , not only the war of words , but in actual truth , the sabre - rattling between Iran and the west and between Iran and the US has become more intense the longer it has gone on . 
And because of the uncompromising attitude between Iran and the US , recently there have been certain changes in the situation . That is , Iran officially announced the day before yesterday that it would resume its plan to extract enriched uranium . 
In fact , some western diplomats speculate that Iran had actually already resumed certain processes in the extraction of enriched uranium prior to this . 
In addition , Iran also announced that it was postponing talks with Russia for an indeterminate period of time . The talks were to deal with Russia taking over the extraction of enriched uranium . 
Of course , the postponement for an unlimited duration of the plan to hold talks was also brought about by the new situation that currently exists . 
And recently , because the US has continued to threaten that it will attack Iran , the Oxford Research Institute , a British think tank , issued a report . 
If the US actually employs military force , it will result in half the people being killed and furthermore would certainly spark a protracted wave of violence in the Middle East . 
Also , terrorist attacks would also grow in intensity . 
The price of oil would without doubt also surge in what would be one part of a domino effect . 
Moreover , the report also says that if the US fails to subdue Iran , it will result in Iran resolving to move faster toward manufacturing its own nuclear weapons . 
We just spoke about the issue of talks between Russia and Iran . 
In fact , a spokesman for the Iranian government said on Monday that because the situation had changed , Iran would postpone talks with Russian officials originally scheduled on the 16th regarding the extraction of enriched uranium inside Russia 's border . 
A spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said : No official notice has yet been received from Iran . 
It is therefore too early to say if the meeting will be postponed . 
Furthermore , Russia 's federal Atomic Energy Agency and the Commissioner of Energy Resources [ Gu Jinuofu ] said on Monday : Russian has prepared for talks with Iran on the nuclear issue and the conditions and principles for negotiation . 
At the same time , recently the United States ' New York Times published an editorial . 
The title of the editorial was also very attention - grabbing . It was called Japan 's Offensive Foreign Minister . 
The editorial highlighted the fact that Japan 's foreign minister , Taro Aso , has recently issued a string of shocking statements . 
The statements were all extremely disingenuous and also extremely unwise , and they provoked widespread resentment in Asian countries . 
The editorial likewise made special note of the fact that the Japanese should acknowledge their errors and learn their lesson , rather than , as is currently the case , avoiding mention in post - war educational material of the things they did during the war . 
At the same time , the editorial also says that many of the opinions aired by Taro Aso , such as demanding that the prime minister pay homage at the Yasukuni Shrine and saying that colonial rule improved Taiwan 's , uh , that Japanese colonial rule improved Taiwan 's educational standards , and so on , that he would make such statements shocked people , and , well , it is clear that he is bereft of any knowledge of history and that his diplomatic skills are also extremely poor . 
The New York Times had the third largest circulation in the US last year . It can therefore be considered influential in US society . 
So this editorial should also have quite an effect . 
At the same time , some former senior officials in the US government as well as some specialists in Asian issues have started a special discussion forum , that is , a discussion forum on Sino - Japanese relations . 
In the discussion forum , some specialist put forth the following viewpoint . 
They said Sino - Japanese relations were currently in a very tense period and that there was a potential danger of armed conflict . 
Moreover , they said that the possibility of armed conflict breaking out between China and Japan was currently even greater than that of armed conflict over the Taiwan Strait . 
Uh , and once armed conflict breaks out , the US will definitely be dragged into it because the US is certain to become involved . 
A spokesman from Japan 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs who also participated in the forum said that Sino - Japanese relations were in truth at a very tense stage currently . 
Any mistake could lead to serious consequences . 
Elsewhere , the Georgian Parliamentary Committee on Defense and Security held a general meeting and decided to eject the Russian peacekeeping troops that are in the South Ossetia region . 
Russia 's parliament will hold a general assembly today in order to deliberate the proposal . 
Uh , specialists say that if the proposal to expel Russian peacekeepers is approved , it could lead to a complete breakdown in relations between Georgia and Russia . 
A spokesman for the Russian peacekeeping force said on the 14th that two military food - transport vehicles belonging to the Russian peacekeeping force were blocked by Georgian police and the driver was expelled . 
Uh , the spokesman demanded that Georgia immediately halt such provocative activities , otherwise Russia would not bear responsibility for the consequences stemming from the incident . 
The two military vehicles transporting grain and non - staple foods and belonging to the logistical system of the Russian peacekeeping forces were inspected on Monday night by Georgian police in the South Ossetia region of Georgia . 
The on - duty Georgian police expelled the Russian driver and the detained personnel and forcibly removed the two military vehicles . 
The incident has angered the Russian peacekeeping force . 
A spokesman for the Russian peacekeeping force said that on February 1 the Georgian police confiscated a military vehicle in the region on the basis of a traffic accident . The truck has not yet been returned . 
On February 8 , it again used a visa problem as a reason to detain three Russian officers for two full days . 
Georgia 's arbitrary acts of provocation aim to cause a bloody incident in the region and force the Russian soldiers to fire their weapons , so that the peacekeeping force will withdraw from South Ossetia . 
The same day , Russia 's ambassador to Georgia issued an urgent petition to the Georgians , demanding that Georgia immediately halt its insane provocation , otherwise Russia would not be responsible for any conflict that resulted from it . 
Media reported that on February 13 Georgian Defense Minister Okruashvili announced that the head of the Russian military base in Akhalkalaki sold the South Ossetians a number of missiles used in Strela - type portable anti - aircraft missile systems . 
On the same day , the Georgian Parliamentary Committee on Defense and Security held a general assembly and , after hearing a report by the law - enforcement department , decided to expel the Russian peacekeepers inside Georgia 's border and ask the general parliamentary assembly on the 14th to deliberate on the matter . 
Specialists believe that once the final decision is made , it could lead to a final and complete breakdown in relations between Georgia and Russia . 
Prior to this , Georgian Minister of Minister of Foreign Affairs Bezhuashvili vehemently criticized the Russian position and rejected Russian President Putin 's discourse that if the west recognized Kosovo , Russia might recognize Abkhazia and South Ossetia , saying that the Russian government was sending out encouraging signals to all separatist regions . 
Prior to this , the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said that it would protect Russians in South Ossentia , thereby implying a threat of military force directly against Georgia . 
Lu Yuguan , Phoenix Satellite Television , reporting from Moscow . 
Admiral Roughead , commander of the US Pacific Fleet , announced on Tuesday that this summer the US ... eh ... would dispatch four aircraft carriers to the Asia - Pacific region to hold the largest military exercise in the past decade . 
Roughead also said that the US ... eh ... would not view China as a threat . 
The US military hopes to be able to hold joint exercises with the PLA navy again . 
This statement immediately aroused the attention of US defense experts . 
On Wednesday , the American think - tank the Heritage Foundation held a workshop on the Pentagon 's Defense Review . 
The subtle relationship between the report and the military exercise became one of the focuses of discussion . 
Some people hold that Roughead 's open invitation to China to take part in the exercise is an olive branch held out to China by the US . 
While inviting China to take part in the exercise , the US military also expressed the hope that the operations of PLA would be more transparent . Therefore , some defense experts believe that this is evidence that the Pentagon is unclear about China 's intention to expand its military force and hopes to use the joint military exercise as an opportunity for mutual probing and sounding out . 
Furthermore , because the Defense Review released by the Pentagon early this month regards China as the greatest potential threat in the future , two defense experts have pointed out that the Asia - Pacific military exercise is the first step taken by the US Department of Defense to adjust its strategy on this basis . 
This is reported by Xie Xiaoshuang of Phoenix TV from Washington . 
Furthermore , ... eh ... the military exercise held by the US this summer is being watched carefully because this is the first time in the past decade that the US ... eh ... will have four aircraft carriers in a military exercise at the same time and also the first time since the Vietnam War that the US will move aircraft carriers from its east coast to the western Pacific region for such a military exercise . 
And the military exercise ... eh ... actually , it is carried out frequently , and will occur four times in these few months ... 
Eh ... one of them will be a multinational military exercise . 
This multinational military exercise will include Japan , South Korea and Australia . 
Now let 's take a look at today 's headlines .

In addition , Hu Jintao also expressed profound sorrow for the tragic deaths of the Chinese personnel and expressed his sincere condolences to their families . 
Okay , regarding this issue , we are now going to contact Chen Yiming , reporter for the People 's Daily in Islamabad , in order to find out the newest developments . 
Hello , Mr. Chen . 
Can you give us the newest developments in the investigation into the shooting deaths of Chinese engineers ? 
Eh , yes , Anchorman . 
Eh , from what I 've been able to learn from the Chinese consulate - general in Karachi regarding the situation , the ... eh ... Chinese embassy and consulate have , uh , informed the unit to which the victim 's belonged of the tragedy . 
And , eh , according to standard procedure , then , uh , arrangements for the victim 's remains should be carried out after consulting with their work unit and their , uh , families . 
Furthermore , Pakistan 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a statement yesterday . 
Their , uh , statement said that , uh , the provocateurs in this incident were aiming to create tension in relations between China and Pakistan . 
Um , the statement says that a thorough investigation would be carried out into the incident and , eh , toward , uh , in Pakistan , eh , strengthen security and protection measure for all Chinese , eh , working in the country . It also says , um , the Pakistani authorities would do everything they could to prevent the reoccurrence of similar incidents . 
Um , in addition , according to a report on the evening of the 15th by Pakistan 's privately - owned television station GEO , the CEO of the Attock Cement Factory in Pakistan , Bashir , said that evening during , eh , in an interview with that station that in the aftermath of the attack Pakistan would organize as soon as possible the repatriation of the remaining eleven Chinese engineers and technicians working on the construction of the cement project . 
And this Bashir also said during the interview that , in regard to questions by Pakistani media as to why , uh , at the time of the incident the Chinese engineers were not accompanied by security personnel , uh , he said , eh , that in actuality the cement plant where the engineers worked had its own security system but that because the location of the incident was still within the limits of the factory area there were no accompanying security personnel when the incident took place . 
He expressed his extreme regret over the tragic incident . 
Anchorman . 
Um , okay . 
Uh , in addition , this is actually not the first time that Chinese engineering personnel have been killed in attacks in Pakistan . 
A similar incident occurred in October 2004 . 
Two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by an armed group in South Waziristan . 
In the end , one of the individuals was tragically killed in the rescue operation . 
Also , three engineers were killed in a bomb attack in Gwador in May of the same year . 
Let 's take a look back . 
On May 3, 2004 , in the port of Gwador in the south of the Pakistani province of Balochistan , a vehicle carrying twelve Chinese headed toward a worksite at the port was hit by a car bomb attack . 
As a result , three Chinese engineers were killed and nine individuals were injured . 
Local armed separatists and tribal militants are believed to have launched the attack . 
On October 9 of the same year , two Chinese engineers were kidnapped by armed militants in the area of South Waziristan in the border region between Pakistan and Afghanistan . 
A short while after , one engineer was fatally shot as Pakistani troops were rescuing the hostages . 
However , it is believed that the hostage - taking was carried out by armed militants linked to Al Qaeda and not armed separatists . 
Because China has close economic ties with Pakistan and participates in infrastructure projects in that country , several Chinese engineers work there . 
On the other hand , there are also armed tribal groups in Pakistan that accuse the government of plundering their natural resources . 
This has resulted in Chinese becoming the victims of attacks or kidnappings on several occasions . 
This is a news brief by Phoenix Satellite Television . 
Let 's take a look at some news items from Japan . 
Recently , Japan 's political arena produced some rather sensational news . 
That is , Tsuneo Watanabe , chairman of one of Japan 's leading papers , the Yomiuri Shimbun , he ordered Yomiuri Shimbun to publish some articles ... eh ... that oppose Koizumi 's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine , marking Yomiuri Shimbun 's shift to a stand against Koizumi 's visit to Yasukuni Shrine . 
Eh ... so ... this Tsuneo Watanabe ... , in the speech he made a few days ago , he also lashed out at Koizumi ... , saying that he is ignorant and has no historical and cultural knowledge . 
At the same time , he commented that visiting Yasukuni Shrine was just like paying tribute to Hitler and said that , in so doing , Koizumi ... eh ... had caused China and South Korea to ... eh ... regard Japan as a very dangerous country . This will bring endless troubles . 
So why has Tsuneo Watanabe 's attitude caused such a repercussion ? 
In fact , he is very influential in political circles and has always been a major behind - the - scenes operator . 
And he used to be a very rightist figure . 
It should be said that he has always been a supporter of the hawks and strongly advocated revision of the constitution . 
But , now , ... well ... this is really a major turn - around . 
He turned his gun and ... eh ... opened fire on Koizumi , adopting an attitude of opposition . 
Actually , in 2004 , when Koizumi was being criticized for visiting Yasukuni Shrine , this Tsuneo Watanabe ... he ... eh ... he said that he supported it and wanted Koizumi to withstand the pressure . 
Recently , however , he made a speech , saying : " I am over 80 years old and don 't have many days left . " 
So , he now stands up to make a high - profile speech with a very opposing attitude . 
Such a turnaround of course produced a significant impact on the entire Japanese society . 
Just as Tsuneo Watanabe himself put it , he said : " I am convinced that I have the strength to control and change the direction of the political winds . " 
And he also said that he would put up a desperate resistance if the government pressured Yomiuri Shimbun with respect to its freedom of speech or its ability to interview . 
So , what has the situation come to now ? 
Well , Japan 's largest newspaper , Yomiuri Shimbun , and the second largest newspaper , Asahi Shimbu ... eh , these two leading newspapers have started to team up in opposition to Koizumi 's visit to Yasukuni Shrine . 
Originally , the two papers were opponents , but after the two chairmen met , they were able to reach agreement on this issue at least . 
Therefore , they have now launched a campaign of considerable scale to criticize Koizumi . You can say that they have formed an ideal combination . 
Actually , these two large newspapers have great sway over mainstream public opinion in Japan . 
In a separate development , let 's look at the meeting of the Japanese parliament . At a recent meeting , two candidates favored to succeed Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi made the same type of remarks . 
Who were the two ? 
One was Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe and the other was Minister for Foreign Affairs Taro Aso , who of late has frequently made astonishing remarks . 
What did the two say ? 
They said that Japanese war criminals of the Second World War were not criminals . 
What they mean is ... eh ... that , they claimed that these criminals ... it was the intention of the international court to convict them . 
But , in Japan , according to international laws ... they were citing the domestic laws of Japan ... eh ... the war criminals ... did not break the domestic laws of Japan . 
So , they think that , in Japan , World War II criminals should not be regarded as criminals . 
This Shinzo Abe ... he also mentioned that Japan now ... eh ... should take the whole world into account , develop relations with the United States and develop commercial and trade relations with some East Asian countries , and , furthermore , it should also try to develop closer ties with India rather than always focus on China . 
China 's New E - Banking Regulations Take Effect March 1 
BEIJING , February 6 ( Xinhua ) ( Reporter : Han Jie , Xu Bo ) Reporters were informed on the 6th by the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) that two rules recently issued by the CBRC - - the Electronic Banking Administration Measures and the Electronic Banking Security Assessment Guide - - will take effect on March 1, 2006 . 
A CBRC spokesman said that according to provisions of the Administration Measures , the examination and authorization method for foreign - capital financial institutions remains essentially unchanged . Namely , if foreign bank branches that have already been authorized to open online banking services need to add additional online banking products , their primary reporting bank must submit a consolidated application . 
, In June 2001 , the China People 's Bank promulgated the Interim Measures for the Administration of Online Banking Operations to standardize use of the Internet by commercial banks in developing banking services . 
A CBRC spokesman said that with the continuous development of the online banking operations of commercial banks , the Interim Measures no longer answered the need for supervision and control of risks in online banking . For this reason , the CBRC enacted the two new regulations . 
According to the CBRC spokesman , the CBRC 's approval of the qualifications of security assessment organizations is different from the administrative approval of qualifications for industry access or market access . It is not a prerequisite for assessment organizations developing electronic banking security assessment services , but is instead only a reference for financial institutions choosing an assessment organization . 
Financial institutions can hire a security assessment organization to perform e - banking security assessments as long as the assessment organization complies with relevant conditions and requirements , even if its qualifications have not undergone CBRC approval . Assessments must however be supervised in accordance with relevant regulations . 
The Electronic Banking Administration Measures are divided into 99 items under nine chapters covering general principles , application and change of registration , risk management , management of information exchange and transfer , supervision of out - sourcing , supervision of trans - national business , oversight and administration , legal liability and supplementary provisions . 
The Electronic Banking Security Assessment Guide is divided into 57 items under five chapters , covering general principles , security assessment organizations , implementation of security assessments , administration of security assessment activity and supplementary provisions .

BEIJING , February 6 ( Xinhua ) The book " Speeches , Investigations and Study Papers by Mao Zedong , Zhou Enlai , Liu Shaoqi , Zhu De , Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun " , edited by the Party Literature Research Center of the CPC Central Committee , was recently published and distributed by the Literature Publishing House of the CPC Central Committee . 
Carrying out investigations and studies in an in - depth and practical manner , persisting in the interlinkage of theory and reality , and thereby formulating and implementing accurate paths , guidelines and policies : this is the essential experience and basic working method of the Chinese Communist Party in leading the revolution , construction and reform . 
Mao Zedong , Zhou Enlai , Liu Shaoqi , Zhu De , Deng Xiaoping , Chen Yun and others of the older generation of revolutionaries issued many important and incisive remarks on investigations and studies . They also frequently conducted in - depth social investigations themselves and wrote several investigation reports . 
The implementation and resulting fruits of their investigations and studies have played a significant role in guiding the Party and the people along the correct path of development . 
" Speeches , Investigations and Study Papers by Mao Zedong , Zhou Enlai , Liu Shaoqi , Zhu De , Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun " is divided into three sections : the first section contains a compilation of comments by Mao Zedong and others of the older generation of revolutionaries regarding investigations and studies ; the second section contains a compilation of writings by Mao Zedong and others of the older generation of revolutionaries regarding investigations and studies ; the third section 
This is the first time that most of these investigation reports have been published publicly . 
Furthermore , it also includes two overviews of investigation and study activities by the central leaders during the 1950s and 1960s .

( China - related overseas news ) Third Chinese Compatriot Robbed and Murdered in South Africa in Two Days 
JOHANNESBURG , February 6 ( Xinhua ) ( Reporter : Chen Ming ) Lin Yixing , an overseas Chinese from Fuqing , Fujian Province , China was wounded in the early morning of the 5th ( local time ) in South Africa by local armed individuals during a robbery at the bar he operated . Despite efforts to save him , he died in the early morning of the 6th in a hospital in Bloemfontein , the judicial capital of South Africa . 
According to Feng Yang , president of the Free State Chinese Association , the incident occurred in a bar in the city of Welkom , 130km northwest of Bloemfontein . 
At the time , the bar - owner Lin Yixing was behind the bar counter tidying some articles in preparation to end the business day . 
At that moment , one of the three clients that were still in the bar pulled out a gun and ran behind the counter in order to carry out a robbery . 
The forty - year - old Lin Yixing struggled with the culprit , who fired at Lin Yixing and then fled . 
Locals who rush to the scene upon hearing the news took Lin Yixing to a hospital for urgent treatment . Because Li Yixing 's body experienced " general diffuse capillary leakage " , the bleeding could not be stopped and he died at approximately 3:30 a.m. on February 6 . 
On February 6 , Consuls Xu Defu and Wu Gang of the Chinese Consulate in Johannesburg , Vice - president of the South African Fujian Township Association Ling Changming and others rushed by car to Bloemfontein to assist the relatives of the deceased in dealing with arrangements following the tragedy . 
Lin Yixing was the third Chinese in 36 hours to be killed during a robbery . He is also the fourth Chinese to be murdered in South Africa this year . 
( Newspaper excerpt £ © Shanghai : Part - timers and University Grads Become Main Source of Hourly Workers . 
BEIJING , Feb. 7 ( Xinhua ) The Shanghai Bureau of Labor and Social Security released on the 6th the " 2006 Most Recent Guidance for Hourly Wages " . It covers 120 kinds of positions--11 more than the last edition - - and reveals that wages for certain positions previously covered have risen in some cases and fallen in others . 
According to estimates by experts at the Shanghai Bureau of Labor and Social Security , the number of hourly workers now exceeds one million . 
China Youth Daily has reported that university graduates and part - timers are the main source of hourly workers . 
Results of a direct survey of nearly 8000 hourly workers show that more than half are part - timers , with the percentage reaching 51.1 % . 
The educational level of these part - timers is generally high , with most engaged in highly technical labor such as translation work , in which part - timers make up 81.7 % of the manpower . In the fitness industry , they occupy up to 61.6 % of the positions . 
High income is one of the main reasons many people do hourly part - time work . 
According to sources , the monthly income from some positions can be in the tens of thousands of yuan with manpower still being in short supply . Simultaneous interpretation is one such example . The monthly income for most hourly positions - - such as part - time accountants and wedding masters of ceremony - - can reach 2000 yuan or more . 
Another important reason that hourly part - time work has become popular is the desire to satisfy personal interest and expand one 's knowledge . 
For example , Mr. Gu , manager of an enterprise 's human resources department , spends several hours each week processing financial accounts for the representative office of a foreign company . 
Mr. Gu says the greatest benefits of part - time work are the continuous upgrading of one 's knowledge and the opportunity to dabble in a different field . Of course , the 2000 yuan in monthly income is also attractive . 
Because some hourly positions have a low threshold and flexible work arrangements , they are gradually finding favor with many job - seeking graduates . Fourteen percent of hourly workers graduated from university or technical schools in the last three years . 
" Initially , I wasn 't interested in hourly work . But after a few months , I feel that it is better than a nine - to - five job . " 
After Young Huang graduated from university , he could not find a job he liked . Finally , he signed up at a hotel to play background music on a piano . 
" At 100 yuan an hour and with the good environment , I am very satisfied with my job . What I need now is to find more hourly jobs . " 
According to reports , hourly jobs have become an important route for job - hunting graduates to accumulate work experience , hone their work skills , improve their communication skills and gain increased social experience . 
Graduates doing hourly work are mostly concentrated in positions requiring a high level of knowledge and skills , such as highly specialized translating positions and positions involving highly contemporary art or entertainment work . These two fields account for 22.1 % and 26.8 % respectively . 
Some hourly positions , such as foodstuff salespersons and shipping clerks , do not require a high level of skill and can be filled by unemployed persons following some simple training . 
Data shows that the unemployed make up 39 % of hourly workers . The proportion of unemployed workers is as high as 68.4 % in retail - related positions and 58.7 % in catering - related positions . Hourly work has become an important path to employment for the unemployed .

Wu Bangguo emphasized that China has entered the stage where it must rely more on enhancing its ability for independent innovations and improving the qualifications of its laborers to boost its economic and social development . Only by strongly pushing scientific and technological progress and innovation is it possible to bring about a leap of quality in productivity and push economic and social development onto the track of scientific development . 
Anhui should lose no time in establishing and improving a mechanism favorable for innovation , increase investment in science and technology , encourage patents and inventions , develop name brands , speed up the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into real productivity , strengthen the central status of enterprises in independent innovations and continuously raise the contribution rate of scientific and technological progress to economic growth . 
Anhui should support and encourage the inclusion of technological elements into distribution , establish and improve the system of statistical indexes for independent innovation , study and formulate policies that support independent innovation in finance , taxation and government procurement so as to form a policy system that encourages independent innovation . 
Anhui should cultivate innovation awareness in the all of society , strongly advocate the spirit of being bold in innovation and competition and work hard to create an atmosphere favorable for the emergence of talent . 
Wu Bangguo also said that the People 's Congress is playing an increasingly greater role in promoting the management of state affairs according to law and the construction of a socialist legal state . 
To make a success of the work of the People 's Congress under the new situation , it is necessary to , first , adhere to a correct political orientation , unswervingly keep to the road of the socialist political development with Chinese characteristics and organically combine the practices of persisting in the leadership of the Party , placing the people in power and managing state affairs according to law ;

It is also necessary to adhere to the mass line , be people - oriented , exercise power and pursue interests with the people in mind . 
China Puts Forth Major Research Programs for Next 15 Years 
BEIJING , February 9 ( Xinhua ) ( Reporter : Li Xing ) In a bid to increase China 's international competitiveness , vigorously promote sustainable development , and realize breakthroughs in key areas , the National Guideline on Medium - and Long - Term Programs for Science and Technology Development ( 2006 - 2020 ) published by the State Council on the 9th lays out four areas of major scientific research . 
The four major scientific programs are the study of protein , research into the control of quanta , nano research and the study of growth and reproduction . 
The guideline says protein science is a peak of the life sciences that has developed countries energetically vying with each other .

China must give top priority to the study of quantum information carriers as well as the principles and methods of control , quantum calculation , the effect of new quanta on limited small quanta systems , new principles and new technical foundations for the characterization and measure of quantum control . 
Furthermore , the guideline says nano technology has become the strategic choice of many countries for upgrading their core competitiveness and is also a realm is which China has hope of achieving great leaps in development . 
In the next 15 years , China 's key research in the domain will include controllable preparation , self - assembly and enabling of nano - particles ; nano - electronics ; nano - biology and nano - medicine ; nano measuring , characterization and metrics ; and the use of nano particles and nano technology in various fields , including energy , environment , information , and medicine . 
The growth in China 's population is large and there are many born with defects . There is a serious shortage of organs for transplant and a peak in the aging of the population is coming . For this reason , there is an urgent need for breakthroughs and technical innovation in the reproduction and developmental sciences . 
According to the Guidelines , in 2006 - 2020 China will focus its research on stem cell proliferation , division and control ; the occurrence , maturation and fertilization of reproductive cells ; the decline of human reproductive capabilities and the mechanism for degenerative illnesses ; and the safety and principles of assisted reproduction and stem cell technology .

( Overseas China - related news ) Argentinean Overseas Chinese Strongly Denounce Chen Shui - bien 's Remarks on Taiwan Independence 
BUENES AIRES , February 8 ( Xinhua ) ( Reporter : Cao Yu ) A stern declaration was issued on the 8th by the Argentinean Council for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification of China , an organization founded by overseas Chinese traveling and residing in Argentina , strongly denouncing Chen Shui - bien 's recent remarks on Taiwan independence and opposing any scheme aimed at splitting Taiwan from China . 
The declaration said that Chen Shui - bien 's assertion in his speech on January 29 that he intended to scrap the National Reunification Council and the National Reunification Guidelines is another step toward Taiwan independence .

Chinese Experts : US Making Groundless Accusations by Playing Up " China Military Threat " 
BEIJING , Feb. 9 ( Xinhua ) ( Reporters : Li Xuanliang , Xiong Zhengyan , Lin Liping ) In the Quadrennial Defense Review it formally submitted recently to Congress , the US Pentagon has said for the first time that China is " the emerging power that has the greatest potential to militarily challenge the United States . " 
Experts say this is unreasonable finger - pointing at China 's normal defense construction , an exaggeration of the " Chinese military threat " and an interference in China 's internal affairs . 
The Quadrennial Defense Review is the Pentagon 's new national defense guidelines . 
The 92 - page report devotes three paragraphs to the issue of China 's military and the countermeasures the United States should take . The report makes 15 direct references to " China " or " Chinese " and says that " as an important emerging power , China has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States . If the United States fails to take countermeasures , China will very likely field disruptive military technologies that could offset traditional U.S . military advantag 
Yao Yunzhu , researcher with the Department of World Military Research at the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences , said that although senior US officials have expressed similar viewpoints on various earlier occasions , this is the first time that the US has said in the defense report that " China is the major emerging power that has the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States " . 
" It is the first time that this report has explicitly referred to Russia , India and China as rising strategic opponents and , in particular , focused more on the so - called ' Chinese military threat ' , " 
said Major General Peng Guangqian , a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences . 
Worthy of note is that on the same day the Quadrennial Defense Review was officially submitted , US President Bush also submitted the government budget for the 2007 fiscal year to Congress . It included US $ 439.3bn earmarked for national defense . 
" If the budget supplemented for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan is included , the American national defense budget for the 2007 fiscal year will top US $ 500bn to reach an all - time high , " Peng Guangqian said . " This is almost equal to the total of the defense expenditures of the rest of the world 's countries . " 
Peng Guangqian says fabrication of " foreign threats " by the United States reflects the Pentagon 's consistent style of " manufacturing enemies " , and that its real intention is to secure more defense funds so as to bring in more profits for the colossal weapons industry groups of the United States . 
Experts say that compared to the huge military expenditure of the United States , China 's national defense spending is very limited . 
Military expert Deng Hongzhou , who has participated several times in the compilation of the white book on Chinese national defense , said that since the 1990s China 's national defense spending has indeed increased as its economic has developed , but its proportion of the national financial expenditure in the same period has shown an overall downward trend . 
Official data shows that compared with 1979 , the proportion that China 's 2004 national defense expenditure took in the national financial expenditure in the same period dropped by nearly 10 % . 
In 2005 , China 's national defense expenditure was Rmb244.656bn , equal to only 1/14 that of the US ; the per capita military expenditure was equal to only about 1/60 that of the US and military expenditure per serviceman was equal to 1/30 that of the US military . 
" The US is about as large as China in terms of territory , but the difference in their military spending is so great . It is self - evident whose military power has exceeded the needs of legitimate defense , " 
Peng Guangqian said . 
Teng Jianqun , director of the Research Department of the China Association of Armament Control and Disarmament , says that the US should objectively evaluate China 's military construction and adds that China 's peaceful development does not mean that China and the US will become military adversaries in the future . 
The 2004 China National Defense white book says that China keeps firmly to the road of peaceful development and implements a defensive national defense policy . 
China is no threat to any country , either in the past , at present or in the future . 
To date , China has established no military base in any other country and has not sent even a single soldier to another country . In contrast , the US keeps some 100 military bases abroad and has deployed 100,000 troops in Asian alone . 
Professor Zhu Feng of the College of International Relations , Beijing University says China and the US should use existing channels to increase communication and exchange , improve mutual understanding and trust , promote a constructive Sino - US partnership in the new century and jointly promote and maintain world peace and development .

( International Observation ) Hamas Seeks Breakthrough in Forming Cabinet 
RAMALLAH , Feb. 9 ( Xinhua ) ( International Observation ) Hamas Seeks Breakthrough in Forming Cabinet 
( Xinhua Reporters : Wang Hao , Huang Min ) 
Following the victory of Palestine 's Islamic Resistance Movement ( Hamas ) in parliamentary elections , how the new government will be laid out has become a focus of international attention . 
What kind of policies Hamas carries out will directly influence the policy directions taken by the various parties involved in the peace process . 
At the same time , the resistant attitude of the US and Israel will be an additional variable in the prospects of the Hamas - lead government . 
At present , the different Palestinian sides are stepping up discussions in an active quest for a breakthrough in problems and sensitive issues that the cabinet formation poses toward future development of the situation . 
( subhead ) Who Will Become Prime Minister ? 
Since Hamas won the right to form a cabinet , some outsiders have expressed worry that a split could take place between the " Hamas Prime Minister " and the Palestinian leader , Abbas . 
In addition , the leader of Hamas , Mashaal , who is currently visiting Egypt , stressed that a Palestinian government formed by the leaders of Hamas would not recognize Israel , a hard - line signal that heightened international concern . 
The US and Israel have clearly stated they will not accept a Hamas - led government with real power and have threatened to cut off economic aid to Palestine and freeze the transfer of tax revenues . 
But this has not prevented Hamas from carrying out some agile strategic adjustments , including a compromise policy of selecting independents . 
According to reports , in order to maximize recognition from the international community , in recent days overseas and domestic leaders of Hamas gathered in Egypt decided to select an independent figure , Ismail Haniyeh , chairman of the board of Gaza Islamic University , to become the new prime minister . 
Concerned parties have not yet responded to the move . 
Palestinian analyst Hisham said that , whoever takes over the prime - ministership , the most important thing is that the person should be capable of toning down Hamas ' hard - line character , since only in this way can the success of the cabinet be guaranteed . 
( subhead ) How will authority be distributed ? 
From an internal perspective , the biggest challenge faced by the Hamas - led cabinet is a lack of adequate experience in power . 
An analysis in an article in the Palestinian daily Al - Ayyam said that Hamas gained popularity through social welfare projects but lacked experience in office . Cooperation with the Palestinian National Liberation Movement , or Fatah , will be the best solution . 
After the election , Hamas raise the possibility of a " political partnership " with Fatah and the joint establishment of a national coalition government , but until now Fatah has not given a positive response . 
Fatah is internally split regarding whether to participate in the cabinet . One faction advocates taking part in the new government in order to have some sway ; another faction refuses the invitation by Hamas and wants instead to be " an active opposition " in parliament . 
Informed sources say Fatah , with persuasion coming from Abbas , is gradually leaning toward participating in the new government . 
Even so , Hamas and Fatah will still haggle over the distribution of cabinet posts . 
Another path would be to establish a cabinet outside the parliamentary framework and ignore party affiliation . 
According to reports , Hamas has also laid out a government composed uniquely of experts , but the actual name list is still unknown . 
In view of US and Israeli attitudes , a government of technical experts is a way of forming a cabinet that will help lighten pressure from outside . 
Palestine 's Basic Law provides that the naming of the prime minister and the cabinet will take three to five weeks to complete once the new parliament takes over on the 16th of this month . 
( subhead ) How do the weapons fit in ? 
Hamas ' weapons constitute another thorny issue in the forming of the new government . 
The US and Israel have an extremely hard - line attitude , insisting that Hamas renounce violence and refusing to let it take part in the government while armed . 
The leader of Hamas , Mashaal , emphasized on the 9th that armed resistance is the organization 's " strategic choice " . 
The issue of weapons in reality includes two levels : the legality of weapons and the administration of jurisdiction over armed forces . 
That Hamas became the largest party in parliament through a democratic and free election has been recognized internationally . It will , through similarly legal methods , try to integrate its armed branch , the Al - Qassam Brigade , into the government 's security apparatus . 
Hamas has floated in the past the idea of unifying all the armed factions into a Palestinian national force , or " People 's Army " , but the idea was not widely acknowledged and was even criticize by the Palestine Islamic Jihad . 
Palestine currently has 60,000 security personnel , the vast majority of which are from the Fatah camp . 
In addition , Fatah also has some loose organizational ties to affiliated armed factions such as the al - Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and the Fatah Hawks . 
Responsible for forming a cabinet , Hamas will have to come to terms with Fatah regarding how to manage these various self - governing armed groups and reasonably distribute power over the security administration . 
According to local media reports , Abbas wants to oversee the security and intelligence forces . The police and civil defense forces would be overseen by the internal affairs department of the new government . 
But the various sides are still negotiating this sensitive issue and until now there have been no developments . 
China Issues Its First Polar Exploration Report 
BEIJING , Feb. 10 ( Xinhua ) ( Reporter : Li Jianmin ) China 's State Oceanic Administration (SOA) has issued the 2005 China Annual Polar Exploration Report , the first of its kind since China began scientific polar exploration more than 20 years ago .

The Report records that at 22:15 on January 9, 2005 ( Beijing Time ) the Chinese Antarctic Expedition 's Inland Icecap Exploration Team successfully scaled Dome A , the highest inland icecap in Antarctica , and determined at 3:15 a.m. on January 18 ( Beijing Time ) that the elevation of the highest point of Dome A is 4093m . 
" On the increasingly competitive stage of international polar investigation , Chinese took the lead in charging the 'highest point on the Antarctic icecap ' and achieved success in one go by relying on their adamant will , intrepid spirit and courage to break new ground , realizing another dream for mankind in Antarctica , " 
said SOA Director Sun Zhihui . 
The Report says that on March 24, 2005 , the 21st Chinese expedition to Antarctica returned to Shanghai after successfully fulfilling its mission . The expedition took 151 days and covered 26,500 nautical miles . 
On November 18 of the same year , the 22nd Chinese Antarctic expedition left Shanghai for Zhongshan Station in Antarctica , where it will carry out scientific investigation activities . It will leave Zhongshan Station and return to Shanghai by way of Australia at the end of February 2006 . 
Because it is China 's first polar expedition report , the 2005 China Annual Polar Exploration Report also includes a retrospective and summary of China 's exploratory undertakings in the polar regions since they began in the 1980s . 
According to the Report , China officially joined the Antarctic Treaty in 1983 , becoming a member country of the Antarctic Treaty Organization and other most influential international organizations for Antarctic affairs , including Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting , the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research and Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programs . 
In 1997 , China became a member of the International Arctic Science Committee , winning the right to speak and participate in decision - making in international polar affairs . 
The Report points out that over a period of more than 20 years China 's polar explorations " started from scratch , continuously developed and took on scale " , now consisting of a " three stations , one vessel " system for scientific exploration in the Antarctic and Arctic ; that is : the Antarctic Great Wall Station set up in February 1985 , the Antarctic Zhongshan Station set up in February 1989 , the Arctic Yellow River Station set up in July 2004 and " Snow Dragon " polar expedition ship t 
According to statistics contained in the Report , as of the end of 2005 , China had organized 22 scientific Antarctic expeditions , 2 Arctic scientific expeditions using the Snow Dragon as a carrier platform and 2 Arctic expeditions at the Yellow River Station . So far , more than 3000 Chinese expeditioners have participated in field investigations in the Arctic and Antarctic regions . 
" We are currently conducting research on the feasibility of a third Antarctic exploration station . This is also China 's first feasibility study into an inland station in Antarctica . " 
said Sun Zhihui . 
" After more than 20 years of endeavor , China has now gained a footing in world polar exploration . However , compared to other major polar exploration countries , there still exists a large gap and we must catch up , " 
he said . 
Sun Zhihui revealed that China will issue a report on polar expeditions on an annual basis in the future .

HDTV Gradually Becoming Mainstream in US 
NEW YORK , February 12 ( Xinhua ) ( Reporter : Fan Xiaolin ) With the steady drop in the price of HDTVs and a constantly expanding market , US television broadcasters are rushing to respond with high definition television programs . 
The recent Super Bowl , an American - style football competition , became for US advertisers a warm - up match to welcome in the age of high definition television (HDTV) . 
According to a recent report in the Financial Times , the US Congress recently passed a bill that requires US broadcasters to halt all transmission of the current analog television signals on February 17, 2009 and only transmit digital signals . 
This implies that there is a definite time - table for the full digitalization of television program broadcasting in the US . 
The spread of HDTV relies on the one hand on consumers buying the television sets and on the other hand on producers providing high definition digital programming . 
Although digital television has been discussed repeatedly over the past few years , it has not become reality . 
On this issue , there was a turning point this year . 
According to forecasts by America 's Consumer Electronics Association , this year the number of digital televisions sold will exceed the number of conventional televisions sold for the first time . Furthermore , 85 % of the digital televisions sold will be HD products . 
Japanese Researchers Develop New Model of Highly Effective Artificial Kidney 
TOKYO , February 13 ( Xinhua ) ( Reporter : Qian Zheng ) Researchers at Tokai University in Japan have developed a bioartificial kidney . It not only possesses the same catabolic functions as a human kidney , but at the same time is also able to retain useful material components . Additionally , it is small in size and easy to transplant . As more detailed research is carried out , there is hope that it could be good news for people with kidney disease . 
According to a recent report by the Japan Light Industry News , the newly developed bioartificial kidney consists primarily of two parts . One part is composed of " artificial nephrons " that filter metabolic matter and water from blood ; the other part consists of the " artificial renal tubules " the extracts water , amino acids and other useful elements from the primary urine and returns them to the blood . 
The artificial nephrons and the artificial renal tubules are all made from hollow silk thread . The inner wall of the artificial renal tubules is also covered with a layer of tubule epithelial cells capable of breaking down waste . 
This kind of epithelial cell can cause the materials that lead to a disease stemming from chronic dialysis - - dialysis - related amyloidosis - - to be broken down into amino acids and then returned to the blood . At the same time , it can also cause the glucose , vitamins and minerals needed by the body to reenter the blood . 
In the past , artificial kidneys have relied on differences in osmotic pressure to filter metabolic waste but have been unable to eliminate it completely . They were also unable to return amino acids and other components to the blood . 
The researchers conducted experimental transplants of the bioartificial kidney in goats . Epithelial cells from pigs were used to make the inner wall of the hollow threads of the artificial kidney . 
Two weeks later , the researchers confirmed that the artificial kidney had successfully served its function . 
They are currently developing a bioartificial kidney that uses human kidney cells and will conduct clinical studies after its safety has been verified . 
Safe Electricity Production in China Still Faced with Difficult Challenges 
BEIJING , Feb. 13 ( Xinhua ) ( Reporter : An Pei ) An official with the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) said on the 13th that although the safe production of electricity remained stable on the whole in 2005 , it still faces difficult challenges . 
SERC Vice Chairman Shi Yubo said at the Fifth ( Expanded ) Meeting of the National Electricity Safe Production Committee held here that China 's safe production of electric power was generally stable in 2005 , with the task of supplying power during the peak summer period being satisfactorily fulfilled and the safe supply of power being realized . The impact of natural disasters was actively countered , thereby essentially ensuring the safe and stable operation of the electric power syst 
But he also pointed out that changes in power supply and demand and the coming on line of a series of newly built power - generating systems implied new challenges for the safe production of electric power . 
These challenges include the following : electricity shortages will continue to exist on a region - specific , season - specific and time - specific basis ; the supply of power remains stretched in some regions ; major problems still exist in the supply of electricity and coal because of the lack of a positive mechanism for pricing them ; at the same time , the worsening quality of coal has not yet been brought under effective control , seriously affecting the stable operation of power - generati 
Shi Yubo said contradictions buried at deeper levels will continuously be exposed as reform permeates further into the electric power system . The new problem faced will be how to maintain stability within employee ranks and ensure normal , orderly production . 
Discussing about the safe production of electric power in 2006 , Shi Yubo said it was necessary to further strengthen basic initiatives for the management of safe power production ; speed up the establishment and improvement of the emergency control mechanism for electricity safety and enhance emergency reaction capabilities ; step up coordination and team work between plants and grids in the joint maintenance of the safety of the electricity system ; continue a high standard of safety 
According to reports , in keeping with the new situation in electricity safety management , CERC will this year revise and improve the already promulgated Interim Regulations on Investigations into Electricity Production Accidents . At the same time , CERC will also issue support documents concerning the safety of hydroelectric dams and the safety protection of secondary electricity systems this year . 
The power consumption of Chinese society in 2005 reached 2.4689 trillion KWH , registering a year - on - year rise of 13.45 % . 
Confronted with the tautness of power supply and prominent difficulties in the transportation of coals and fuels , electric power enterprises took effective measures to improve equipment management so that all last year no major equipment accident occurred in the national electricity production . 
There were 74 power grid accidents , representing a year - on - year decrease of 127 , and 427 equipment accidents , for a year - on - year decrease of 132 . 
SA Envoy : No Organized Criminal Activities Against Chinese Nationals in South Africa 
BEIJING , Feb. 13 ( Xinhua ) ( Reporters : Wang Jiangang , Hao Yalin ) Vusi B. Koloane , charge d 'affaires of the South African embassy in China , said on the 13th in an exclusive interview with a Xinhua reporter that there in no organized criminal effort against Chinese nationals in South Africa . 
He also said the South African government would do everything possible to " fight all forms of criminal activity . " 
Vusi B. Koloane said that the South African government hopes to " reduce the crime rate to zero " and wants the safety of the lives and property of every foreigner working in South Africa to be fully guaranteed by the local law and citizens . 
So far , four Chinese citizens have been murdered in South Africa in 2006 , causing a widespread expression of concern from the Chinese community . 
China 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has raised the issue with South Africa and warned Chinese citizens traveling to South Africa to be more aware of safety precautions . It also called on overseas compatriots to strengthen unity and friendly care between themselves while also coordinating with police in fighting crime . 
" We express our sincerest sympathies and condolences to the families of those killed . " 
Vusi B. Koloane said , " We feel sorry for what has happened and ask the Chinese people to believe that the government of South Africa is thoroughly investigating every case involving Chinese . " 
According to the Chinese embassy in South Africa , South African police have successfully solved the case of Chen Jianqing , a woman from Fujian , China who was murdered in South Africa on February 5 . One suspect has been arrested . 
Police are currently hunting another suspect . 
Furthermore , the South African embassy in China has revealed that South African police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of a Hong Kong businessman in January this year and that the victim 's possessions have been recovered . 
Speaking of the impact that the killing of Chinese citizens might have , Vusi B. Koloane said that the incidents would " definitely " have a negative impact on business , tourism and other areas of interaction between the two countries , but the impact would " probably be fairly small " in the long run . 
According to Manqoba Nyembezi , tourism attache with the South African embassy in China , the South African embassy issued more than 2,000 visas to Chinese nationals in the first 15 days of this year . 
According to official Chinese statistics , South Africa continued to remain China 's largest trade partner in Africa in 2005 . 
Bilateral trade grew 23 % year - on - year to US $ 7.27bn . 
However , tourism industry sources said the serial killings of Chinese citizens in South Africa in 2004 had a marked influence on the number of tourists traveling to South Africa . 
Statistics from the South African Tourism Board show that 20,331 Chinese tourists visited South Africa in the first half of 2005 , representing a year - on - year decrease of 14.9 % . 
Approximately 200,000 Chinese currently live in South Africa . They are spread throughout South Africa 's cities , town and villages . 
Analysts here have attributed the consistently high rate of crime to the large wealth gap in South African society , high unemployment , the rampant use of guns and the lack of a death penalty to serve as a deterrent . 
Because many Chinese do not understand English , they keep cash on their person and in their homes , making is easier to become the target of an attack by criminals seeking money .

Mourning Hall Set up at Beida for Academician Wang Xuan 
BEIJING , Feb. 15 ( Xinhua ) ( Reporter : Li Jiangtao ) After days of intensive arrangements , the mourning hall for Academician Wang Xuan set up in the Centennial Lecture Hall of Beijing University formally opened at 9:00 on the 15th . By noon , hundreds of people had come to pay their last respects . 
By just after 8:00 , before the morning hall was scheduled to open , scores of people had lined up outside the door . 
In the Centennial Lecture Hall of Beijing University , this reporter saw a black banner hanging on the wall . It read " Profound Grieving for Academician Wang Xuan " . 
Below the banner was a huge funerary portrait more than ten square meters in size . In it , he wore glasses and had a slight smile , reflecting his refined temperament . 
On both sides of the funerary portrait stood several cypresses . Scores of wreaths were lined up on both sides . 
On one of the wreaths , an elegiac couple read " Chinese printing originated in Qin and flourished in the Tang . Contributed to the replacement of letter printing with electronic printing " . 
Funeral music resounded in the morning hall , adding to the heavy and solemn atmosphere . 
In the crowd of mourners were the leaders , teachers and students of Beijing University , as well as friends , colleagues , students and neighbors of Wang Xuan . Many people who had never met him also made a special effort to come . 
Some held flowers in their hands and some carried flower baskets . Each person wore a small white flower on his chest . They walked slowly up to the portrait of Academician Wang Xuan and bowed in a show of mourning . 
Many could not hold back their tears . 
Zhang Wenbin , former director of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage , is an alumni of Beijing University . He told this reporter that , over a decade ago , when he was working in Henan Province , Professor Wang Xuan submitted a report on scientific and technological innovation to the cadres of the Provincial Party Committee on invitation . 
" Academician Wang Xuan is a model we should learn from in both conduct and pursuit of studies . He made significant contributions to the state and society . People will never forget him . " 
Professor Jin Ruilin of the Law School of Beijing University was an old friend and neighbor of Wang Xuan for more than 40 years . 
He was released from hospital only days ago and insisted on coming today to bid farewell to his old friend . 
When leaving his words in the visitor 's book , Mr. Jin could not hold back his sorrow and took out a tissue several times to wipe away his tears . 
He told this reporter that Professor Wang Xuan lived a very simple life . " When he moved into Dongfu Garden , he was already a professor with significant achievements . But he still lived for years in a very small apartment . " 
Later , he moved to Chengze Garden and again lived for over a decade in an apartment that was 70 ~ 80m2 . 
He would not accept the large apartment measuring more than 140m2 in Lanqiying that Beijing University assigned to him nor the apartment in the highrise Fangzheng Building . " 
With deep feelings , Mr. Jin recalled that , during his visit abroad , Wang Xuan was offered very generous remuneration to stay on , but he resolutely declined . 
" At first , he adamantly refused to apply for academician status . It was only after Mr. Zhou Peiyuan made several attempts at persuasion in person that Wang Xuan went to complete the form . " 
What moved Mr. Jin the most was Wang Xuan 's attitude toward training young people . " He repeatedly emphasized that the assessment of his own success depended not on his own achievements , but on what he had done to train young people . " 
According to Mr. Jin , Wang Xuan began to pay attention to training of young people after he had entered into his fifties . He consistently stressed his desire to pave the way for young people and give way to them . 
" This is not easy for a successful scientist . "

An exchange mechanism between China 's NPC and the Chilean Congress has been formally established . 
According to reports , Chilean Senate President Romero and Chamber of Deputies President Asencio signed the agreement in recent days in Santiago , the Chilean capital . 
According to the provisions of the agreement , the two sides will , based on the principles set out in the Joint Communique between China and Chile on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations , establish a political dialogue relationship between China 's NPC and the Chilean Congress , establish a joint - dialogue committee , hold rotating meetings in both countries at unspecified intervals and jointly promote the overall development of the two countries ' relations .

China to Issue Information Network Transmission Right Protection Regulations 
BEIJING , February 15 ( Xinhua ) ( Reporters : Zhou Wei , Li Fei ) Many websites rely on large - scale retransmission of news reports from newspapers and magazines to increase hits . But many have not been authorized to do so and have not paid any fees . To counter this , said Director - General of the Copyright Department of the National Copyright Administration Wang Ziqiang at a news conference held by the State Council on the 15th , the State Council 's impending Information Network Transmissio 
Wang Ziqiang said that according to the laws and regulations currently in effect , works already published in a newspaper or magazine , if an author fails to make a " Not for Use " declaration , magazines and newspapers can use the work without the author 's permission but at the same time be required to pay remuneration . In accordance with the provisions of rules and regulations , the State Copyright Bureau has specially formulated remuneration standards for retransmission of newspapers 
However , according to the laws and regulations currently in effect , while newspapers and magazine have the legal right to require authorization , Internet sites do not have the same right . 
According to a related judicial interpretation by the Supreme People 's Court , the method in which the legal right to require authorization is applied to newspapers and magazines can be applied to the Internet , so that short articles published in newspapers , magazines and on the Internet can be used on the Internet without acquiring permission if the author has not made a " Do Not Use " declaration , with the user being required to pay remuneration . 
But because the judicial interpretation does not make any stipulations regarding remuneration standards , in practice no remuneration is being paid when these works are used on the Internet . 
" On the issue of whether legal authorization applies to the use on the Internet of short articles that have already been published , this still needs to be determined at the legal level . " 
Wang Ziqiang said : " Whether or not it is to be included within a scope determined by law , it is still necessary to wait for the Information Network Transmission Protection Regulations to be issued this year in order to make a confirmation . 
( International ) Russian Military Says Georgian Parliament 's Vote Will Not Influence Russia 's Peacekeeping 
MOSCOW , Feb. 15 ( Xinhua ) ( Reporter : Song Shiyi ) Russian Defense Ministry press official [ Xiedufu ] told media during a statement on the 15th that the Georgian parliament 's resolution on Russian peacekeepers would not affect the Russian military 's peacekeeping in the short term and that Russian forces would continue to carry out peacekeeping and their mission in the South Ossetia conflict region . 
In a statement the same day regarding the Georgian parliament 's resolution concerning Russia 's peacekeeping forces , Kokoshin , chairman of Russian State Duma ( the lower house of parliament ) Committee on the Commonwealth of Independent States , said that the resolution by Georgia would undo the stability in the current state of affairs in the region and would be detrimental to Russo - Georgian relations . 
He stressed the Georgian parliament 's resolution was a step that would once again take Russo - Georgian relations in a negative direction . 
He said Georgia 's accusations toward Russia were preposterous . 
The resolution passed by the Georgian parliament on that day called for Russia 's peacekeeping forces to halt their peacekeeping activities in South Ossetia but did not stipulate an actual time limit for Russian peacekeepers to withdraw . 
The Georgian parliament accused Russia 's peacekeepers of not carrying out their prescribed duties and viewed actions taken by Russia in the conflict area as " an attempt to annex that part of Georgian territory " . 
The Georgian parliament called on the government to take active measures and consider bringing international peacekeepers into the South Ossetia conflict area to replace Russian peacekeeping in the region . 
The Georgian parliament also instructed the government to revise agreements that stipulated Russian peacekeepers be stationed in the conflict area . 
South Ossetia is an autonomous region in Georgia bordering on the republic of North Ossetia in Russia . 
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union , it unilaterally declared independence and has been in a long - term state of opposition with the Georgian central government . 
Russia currently has a peacekeeping force of 500 stationed in the region . 
The force entered the region under an agreement signed between Russia , Georgia , North Ossetia and South Ossetia .

( Hong Kong , Macao , Taiwan ) Taiwan Authorities Lay Heavy Fine on Hi - tech Giant for Illegal Mainland Investment 
BEIJING , February 16 ( Xinhua ) ( Reporter : Chen Jianxing ) The economic administration authorities of the Taiwan government decided on the 15th to fine United Microelectronics Corporations (UMC) - - one of the " two titans of Taiwan 's chip industry " - - NT $ 5 million for " unlawfully aiding and participating in the establishment " of He Jian Technology in mainland China . 
Taiwan 's China Times reported that this is the first time Taiwan authorities have penalized a Taiwanese business for investing in the mainland since Chen Shui - bian came up with a stance of advocating a cross - strait economic policy of " active management , effective liberalization " . 
According to the report , individuals attached to the Investment Commission of Taiwan 's Ministry of Economic Affairs said UMC was fined because it had violated the Statute Governing Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area as well as the Measures Governing Investment or Technical Cooperation in Mainland China . 
The Investment Commission will fine UMC 's former chairman Tsao Hsing - Cheng and others after reviewing the situation . 
The " UMC Case " began in February, 2005 , when Taiwanese investigators sent nearly a hundred people to raid the homes and offices of several UMC executives , saying UMC was suspected of " illegally providing funds , technology and human resources " to Hejian Technology , a mainland company in which UMC had invested . 
UMC 's chairman at the time , Tsao Hsing - Cheng , publicly stated after the event that UMC had not breached any of the Taiwan government 's regulations and that UMC 's help to Hejian Technology was in UMC 's long - term interest because UMC would lose business opportunities if it failed to quickly enter the mainland market .

UMC 's board accepted Tsao Hsing - Cheng 's resignation on January 9, 2006 . A few hours later , Tsao Hsing - Cheng was officially indicted for alleged illegal investment in the mainland . 
UMC and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC) , which have been called the " two titans of Taiwan 's chip industry " , are the island 's hi - tech giants . 
A series of investigations into UMC by Taiwanese authorities have been closely watched by all sectors of society on the island .

Successfully Heart Transplant Surgery Performed on Infant in Shandong 
JINAN , February 17 ( Xinhua ) ( Zhang Yuqing , Shen Yaoqin ) Jinan Military District Cardiovascular Research Institute recently performed successful heart transplant surgery on an infant . 
In the Intensive Care Unit on the 17th , reporters saw that the infant 's face was plump and red 51 days after the surgery and all monitoring and prognostic indicators were normal . He had smoothly passed through the critical period of the surgery and was now cheerfully playing with toys bought for him by hospital staff . 
The doctor examining him that day explained that when the sick infant from the rural district of Tai ' An in Shandong was brought to the hospital by his parents , his entire body was blue and purple and he was having difficulty breathing . Following a medical examination , he was diagnosed as suffering from cyanotic congenital heart disease that would require a heart transplant . 
Heart transplant surgery is the most difficult , risky and complicated of all heart surgeries . 
This is especially true when it involves a heart transplant in an infant under one year old , something that had never been done in China . 
The Jinan Military District Cardiovascular Research Institute organized specialists who deliberated into the night , meticulously designing a surgical and post - operative - monitoring plan . They devised innovations of their own in the method of vascular anastomosis and carried out tests on animals .

After 295 minutes , the surgery was a complete success . 
State Administration of Work Safety : Curbing Major and Extraordinary Coal Mine Accidents is Most Urgent Task This Year 
BEIJING , Feb. 17 ( Xinhua ) ( Reporter : Liu Zheng ) Following a string of four mining disasters that took the lives of over one hundred people , the grim status of national production safety over the past year has made " curbing major and extraordinary coal mine accidents " the most urgent task in national work safety this year . 
This reporter was informed on the 17th by the State Administration of Work Safety that coal mines must be given top priority if major and extraordinary coal mine accidents are truly going to be curbed . 
To make coal mines safer this year , the State Administration of Work Safety will take a strong hold over the following three items : 
- - Continue to wage an aggressive fight to control gas . 
Control of gas this year must give prominence to " draining gas before mining coal " . 
If high gassy mines fail to " drain gas before mining coal " , they will be legally ordered to immediately halt production . 
- - Continue to wage an aggressive fight to consolidate and close mines . 
The 5243 coal - mine and coal - pit closures already announced to the public must be carried out one by one , as must the more than seven hundred other closures recently announced in various regions . 
Closures must become a part of routine work , with coal mines that destroy resources , pollute the environment and fail to meet safety requirements being shut down without relent . 
- - Strengthen administration of coal - mine safety infrastructure . 
The deterioration of management in the small number of large state - owned mines must immediately be corrected and controlled , while small mines with disorganized management should be guided in the building of standardized safety management systems . 
In particular , key state - owned mines should be tightly controlled in order to strictly prohibit production in excess of capacity , strength or manpower . 
The safe production control standard for this year calls for a 3 % drop over last year in the number of deaths nationally from all types of accidents , including a 3.5 % drop in accidents in coal mines . 
Major accidents with a death toll higher than ten must decrease at least 5 % , while in the coal mines they must decrease 7 % . 
These control standards have been transmitted to the people 's governments of the various provinces . The various regions are breaking them up into their various layers and implementing them at the grassroots and enterprise levels . 
Statistics show that nationally 5986 people were killed in coal mine accidents in 2005 , which represents a 0.7 % decrease year on year . 
But there were more large accidents in which ten or more people were killed , with the number of deaths increasing 66.6 % year on year .

( Winter Olympic Games ? Doping ) News Analysis : Pyleva Incident Likely to End Unsettled 
TURIN , Feb. 17 ( Xinhua ) News Analysis : Pyleva Incident Likely to End Unsettled 
( Reporters : Gao Peng , Ding Ying ) 
Italy has reiterated on several occasions that all athletes found doping during the Turin Winter Olympics could face a " prison term " , but judging from things as they stand now , chances are slim that this will happen to Russian biathlete Olga Pyleva , leading figure in the first doping scandal of these Winter Olympics . 
On the 16th , the Turin Winter Olympics saw its first doping scandal uncovered when Olga Pyleva was found to have used carphedron , a banned drug . 
The following day , the International Olympic Committee announced that Pyleva had been expelled from the Winter Olympics and stripped of the silver medal she won for the women 's 15km individual biathlon at these Winter Olympics . 
The same day , the International Winter Biathlon Union decided to ban her from competition for two years . 
It has been a consistent rule of the International Olympic Committee that any athlete found to have used performance - enhancing drugs at an Olympics Games will have his or her result cancelled and be disqualified from participation , but will receive no legal penalty . 
But under Italian law , athletes commit a crime by carrying and using stimulants . Judicial authorities have the power to directly arrest and investigate all athletes that use performance - enhancing drugs and punish violators with prison terms ranging from three months to three years . 
In December last year , after one year of " bargaining " , the International Olympic Committee and the Italian government finally reached an accord under which the two sides agreed to handle incidents involving doping athletes during this Winter Olympics in accordance with Italian laws . 
Following unremitting efforts by the International Olympic Committee , Italian authorities conceded four days before the opening of the Winter Olympics to a promise that police would not enter the Olympic Village to search athletes ' dwellings during the Winter Olympic Games . But athletes whose drug test proves positive will still be subject to investigation by Italian prosecutors . 
Reports say that Pescante , the Italian government official supervising the Turin Winter Olympics , had referred the Pyleva doping incident to prosecutors in Turin . 
But neither the International Olympic Committee nor Pescante himself has yet confirmed the report . 
Russian biathlon team doctor Andrey Dmytriev disclosed at noon on the 17th that Pyleva had left Turin to return to her country . 
Shi Kangcheng , a Chinese sports official who worked for years in the World Anti - doping Agency , said that once Pyleva returned home the case would very likely end up unsettled . 
Shi Kangcheng added that the International Olympic Committee and the Italian government had never been " thorough " in their anti - doping drive at the Winter Olympics and the outcome would be hard to predict even if Italian prosecutors did step in . 
Based on past instances of punishment handed down to Italian athletes that have used performance - enhancing drugs , the harshest punishment imposed on violators was no more than " two years of prison term served on probation " . 
For this reason , senior reporter of Italy 's ANSA [ pei ai ] predicted that the possibility of Pyleva going to prison was " exceedingly slim " and that a fine would be the most she would receive . 
also said that although an Italian court can pass judgment in absentia , it would be impossible for the Italian police to bring her back from a foreign country for a prison term . 
If Pyleva refused to accept a judgment , there would be no way Italian authorities could detain her . 
News Brief : New Epidemic Areas Continue to Appear , World 's Countries Keep Careful Watch 
BEIJING , Feb. 18 ( Xinhua ) Bird flu has spread further on the African continent , says a summary report by a Xinhua overseas reporter . 
The World Heath Organization (WHO) confirmed on the 17th that birds killed by the bird flu virus have been found in three regions in Egypt . 
In Europe , the H5 bird flu virus has also been found in France for the first time . Europe and Africa are on high alert and are strengthening anti - epidemic measures . 
Hasan al - Bushra , advisor to the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region , said that at present dead birds infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus have been discovered in Cairo and Giza in central Egypt and three areas in Minya in the country 's south . The responsible departments of the Egyptian government have begun to slaughter domestic fowl that could be infected with bird flu . 
Experts say that Egypt is an important passage for migratory birds traveling to the Middle East and North Africa , so it is very likely that the bird flu virus was brought into the country by migrating birds . 
Egypt has announced a ban on live fowl imports and will reinforce quarantine inspections at border entries . 
A poultry farm in Cameroon 's capital Yaounde saw more than 800 birds die in the past week . 
Cameroon has decided to call an immediate temporary halt to all imports of fowl and pork from Nigeria , where bird flu has occurred . It also called a temporary halt to the trade of fowl and related products in all markets in the border area between the two countries . 
With little delay , Cameroon 's government also set up an epidemic monitoring network covering the entire border . The country 's Pasteur Center and the National Veterinary Laboratory are also on an on - call state of alert so that laboratory tests related to the H5N1 virus can be initiated at any time . 
In Europe , Denmark and Sweden preliminarily ruled out the presence of the disease . 
Laboratory test results released by Sweden 's National Veterinary Institute show that the Swedish swans found dead Wednesday were not infected with the bird flu virus . 
Preliminary laboratory results by Denmark 's National Veterinary Administration have also indicated that thirty dead swans found recently within Denmark 's borders were not infected with the bird flu virus . 
But the Department of Agriculture said that Denmark cannot yet lower its guard . 
Romania in Eastern Europe has had nine bird flu outbreaks so far this year . A WHO expert said on the 17th in Bucharest that almost every area in the Danube Delta region has seen cases of bird flu and that the situation must be treated seriously , adding that Romania may continually be threatened by bird flu over the next three to five years . 
In Asia , the government of Bangladesh has taken all necessary measures to prevent bird flu . 
The government 's Department of Livestock Services has provided books on the prevention of bird flu to relevant officials and at the same time has organized training for poultry farmers . 
( Newspaper and periodical selection ) China 's First Blood Supply Data Management System Established in Zhejiang 
BEIJING , February 18 ( Xinhua ) The Blood Center of Zhejiang Province has revealed that China 's first blood supply data management and control network system recently was formally established at the center in recent days and put online . 
An official from the Blood Center of Zhejiang Province said that this means that from now on when any citizen in any county ( municipality , district ) in Zhejiang Province donates blood at an organization that supplies and collects blood , there will be a unique record number . When he donates blood again , the corresponding record number just needs to be entered and information such as personal data , blood type , blood donation records , date of last blood donation and whether blood dona 
The official explained further that if when the corresponding record number is entered the system says the required period between blood donation is not yet over , it will indicate conditions to donate blood on this occasion have not been met . 
This will not only help protect the health of the blood donor , but will also help protect the health and safety of the blood user . 
Futhermore , when blood supply is limited , blood donors and their families will have a preferential right to blood . You only need to enter a valid blood donor ID and the blood donors data will immediately appear . It is extremely convenient . 
According to a report in Hangzhou 's Today Morning Express , the data system is now being used in 36 organizations that collect and supply blood throughout the province . The blood resource status of the province 's organizations that collect and supply blood can also be shown immediately , making it possible for the data to be used throughout the province . 
Eleven Villages Urgently Evacuated in Philippines to Prevent Repeat of Landslide Disaster 
MANILA , February 18 ( Xinhua ) Local Philippine officials said on the 18th the 11 villages in the eastern part of the Philippines have been urgently evacuated in order to prevent a reoccurrence of the recent landslide disaster . 
South Leyte Governor Rosette Lerias said the villages were is the same area and had the same characteristics as the village where the landslide occurred on the 17th . 
The evacuated residents of the 11 villages will be sheltered in seven evacuation centers . 
Lerias said that the government ordered the evacuation yesterday and sent personnel today to check the villages because some people did not want to leave their home . 
The landslide on the 17th occurred at the mountain village of Saint Bernard Township in South Leyte . Judging from scenes shown on television , mud and rock buried the entire village , leaving only a few rooftops visible . 
Because of the thickness and wetness of the mud , there is only very slim hope that the people buried underneath will have survived . 
Currently , 109 deaths have been verified and 57 people have been rescued . 
It is estimated that the number of deaths caused by the disaster could reach 1800 . 
( Overseas Chinese Community ) Exports from Quanzhou , Home of Many Overseas Chinese from Southern Fujian , Increase 35.2 % Year - on - Year in January 
FUZHOU , February 19 ( Xinhua ) ( Guo Yu ) In January this year , overseas exports from the city of Quanzhou continued to maintain a high rate of growth . 
According to customs statistics , in January Quanzhou achieved US $ 303m in exports , attaining a historical high and a year - on - year increase of 35.2 % , surpassing the average growth rate of the entire province . 
According to an analysis by the Quanzhou Foreign Trade Bureau , Quanzhou 's rapid rate of growth in overseas trade in January was primarily because , with its numerous overseas trade support services and measures , enterprises are more motivated to export , its economic operations are vigorous , enterprises are more confident in their operations , and there exists a highly efficient and streamlined environment for the development of overseas trade . 
< HEADLINE > Chance at the Championship , But It 's Not a Sure Thing 
< POSTER > Love life , love Lu Neng 
The China Football Association Super League is set for some fierce battles . 
Luneng Taishan is getting combat - ready for the new season with the championship in mind . 
Hot competitions will be triggered between the Dalian , Shandong and Shanghai teams , the three strongest competitors for the championship . 
In the end , who will win the championship ? 
Based on an analysis of their strengths , Taishan has a very good chance to become champion , but it is by no means a sure thing . 
First of all , the new team members have not had long enough to get worked in . 
Taishan lost at four major events last year . 
This year , Taishan recruited two players from the national team - - Li Leilei and Wang Liang . With the addition of two foreign players soon afterwards , it is safe to say that the team will be stronger . 
But because the national football team is preparing for matches with Palestine and Iraq , there no way to say how well the two players from the national team will integrate . 
By the time they return to the club , league matches will be set to begin . 
That is why integration has become the most significant issue Taishan is facing . 
In my view , the national - team players can be used as backups in the first few rounds of league matches . 
First , team integration can be achieved using the in - game training . 
Second , the national - team players who have just played group matches with the national team can use the lull to rest up . 
After a few rounds , when the " knife is well sharpened ' , it will not be too late for them to play top spots . 
In addition , the defense has some weaknesses . 
Last year , Taishan 's fans had some unfavorable things to say about the team 's defense . 
This year , the defense will have improved with the recruitment of Li Leilei . But it 's still not the time to sit back and relax . 
There 's still the problem of sluggish turnaround at the center back position , and the substitutes for this position are either too old or lacking in experience . 
If performance at the center back position can be stabilized , Taishan will gain some momentum on the road to becoming champion . 
In my opinion , they might as well use Ren Yongshun , who is strong physically . Although he lacks experience , he should be put to work this year so as to be ready in the future . 
In addition , Gao Yao can play center back as well . 
Taishan has quite a few players who can play defending midfield , such as Cui Peng and Hai Bing . 
Gao Yao is physically very strong and a ferocious interceptor . He should be able to handle the center back position . 
Another question is whether the foreign recruits can adjust . 
Taishan has been plagued by problems with foreign recruits . 
The performance of Daniel [ Daniel Danciulescu ] last year was far from stellar . 
We know that this year 's selection of foreign players has not yet been finalized . 
I think that apart from bringing in an excellent striker , a true left - footed midfielder should also be recruited this year . 
Except for Xing Rui , who played for the team a few years ago , Taishan has not had a true left - footed player with good skills . 
Although players like Cui Peng and other can play the position , a truly competent left half back would be greatly preferred to fill - in . 
If these three issues can be solved , Taishan 's road to the championship should be somewhat smoother . 
As a Shandong football fan , I 'm really hoping Taishan can win the championship this year . 
But to be frank , with things looking like they do in the championships this year , Taishan has a good chance , but it is far from a sure thing . 
< HEADLINE > The Incorporation of Batey Ads into JWT 's Network : Is It Too Late to Say Happy New Year ? 
< POSTER > BrandVista Post : 
Hello , everybody . 
Once again , the Chinese New Year has flown by and those who combined their vacation time with their New Year 's holiday are now returning to their jobs . 
We wish all our friends a happy New Year , if it is not too late to say Happy New Year . 
We spoke recently at a cafe with NPLCN . He talked about present - day Brandvista . 
The appearance of the website has improved greatly . 
The content is well structured . 
What pleases him most is the Discuz - powered community BBS , which has undergone a thorough revamping . 
In regards to the community , I must thank one person . 
That is , Mr. Li Mingshun , general manager of Discuz Beijing . 
If you search for his name in Google , you will get a slew of hits . 
You probably know that he was previously with Sina . He later started his own business , setting up an Internet advertisement exchange platform for SMEs that was similar to the overseas website Adbrite.com . 
We discussed it with him at the time on MSN . What he said , in general , was that : Brandvista felt that the development of many industries in China depended on the expansion of the private economy and SMEs . 
And currently , in the Chinese market , this situation does not give reason for optimism . 
So SME 's in creative industries and similar services are unable to provide consultation to any significant extent . 
Collecting high fees to advance one 's own development in the end leads to a discouraging cycle . 
Later , he came to Discuz . 
Discuz is an outstanding forum program powered by PHP and MySQL . 
With the help of Ramboo , a technical engineer from Beijing , Brandvista finally saw the light of day once again and hit the stage with matchless freshness . 
The feedback was very good . 
The interface was neat and friendly . 
It was also very fast . 
With the neat interface , writing a few words that moved me and inspired others , exchanging tidbits about work and life with friends from the same industry that shared the same pursuits , I began to find that this was a pleasure . 
Thank you Discuz ! 
Recently , there has been a lot of news from the advertising industry . 
Starting in January , the WTO system of openness in the ad industry began to be implemented . 
Large foreign companies have been arriving one after another . Small foreign companies are sharpening their sword for battle . It seems to be a scene of prosperity . 
Batey Ads , which rose to prominence in Singapore , has been having many difficulties . 
Having lost a string of big clients and having suffered repeated setbacks in its development in mainland China , Martin Boase finally took a little time from a lawsuit in Italy to think about shuffling things around . 
Batey Ads will merge into JWT 's network , keeping its own brandname and being managed by JWT . 
However , at the same time , there were also rumors that Bates and 141 Network would merge into the Ogilvy and Mather system and be managed by the Ogilvy and Mather network . 
Even if 141 had already given its report to Ogilvy and Mather prior to that , having Ted Bates get payback against Ogilvy and Mather is also a interesting matter . 
During the Spring Festival , several articles on the website were updated . We won 't go into each one here . 
Everybody can go to the website to take a look when they have time . 
At the same time , friends who still haven 't entered the new forum can , with a few extra clicks of a mouse , enter into Brandvista 's completely new community . 
You can get a feel for the environment , get to know the atmosphere and contribute a few words . 
We hope you will find pleasure in finding the group . 
We wish all friends a pleasant mood . 
Goodbye .

< HEADLINE > A Mother Ten Years in the Past 
< POSTER > Helen Li 
I saw this article and decided to share it with you ; 
This is not a momentary impulse , but rather a warm kindheartedness that has long existed in the heart . 
I asked myself what I would do if it were me . 
The answer is very clear . I would way , " You have the wrong number " and hang up the telephone . 
I 've been thinking all this year about how one can actually help someone . 
I have already given up on actions such as donating money or goods . 
A couple days ago a friend said , " I already have no spare time to take care of myself . As for helping people , the heart is there by the means are not . " 
Have a nice day : ) 
Helen 
A Mother Ten Years in the Past 
It was a day ten years ago . The teacher was using the lunch break to nap at home , when suddenly the telephone rang . 
She answered and heard an unfamiliar rough voice from the receiver : " Your child stole a book and we caught her . Come over right away ! " 
The crying of a little girl could also be heard though the receiver , as well as the sound of somebody nearby scolding her . 
She turned her head to look at her only daughter watching the television and then immediately understood what was happening . 
Clearly , a little girl had been caught by a store clerk stealing a book and did not want her family to find out , so she dialed a number at random and happened to call there . 
Of course , she could hang up and forget about it , or even reprimand the party on the other line , 
because this affair had absolutely nothing to do with her . 
But she was a teacher , and it could be that it was one of her students . 
Through the telephone , she could roughly imagine that the little girl who had made a mistake on the spur of the moment was surely terrified , since she was facing what could be life 's most frightening circumstance . 
After hesitating a moment , a thought suddenly came to her mind . Yes , she would do it . 
Thereupon , after asking the bookstore 's address , she rushed over there . 
Just as she had anticipated , standing in the bookstore was a little girl with a face full of tears . 
The adults beside her were ferociously and loudly scolding her . 
She instantly rushed forward and gathered the pitiful little girl into her arms , then turned toward the nearby store clerk and said : " Whatever you have to say you can say to me . You shouldn 't frighten children . " 
During the muttering of the somewhat unwilling store clerk , she paid the fine of less than one hundred yuan and then , with the little girl in hand , walked out of the store where she could see clearly the face overwhelmed by panic and tears . 
She smiled and returned home with the little girl where she tidied her up without asking anything , then let the little girl leave , 
As the little girl was about to go , she also made a point of urging , " If you want to read a book , then come here to Auntie 's house . There are lots of books here . ' 
The still badly shaken little girl looked are her deeply for a moment , then dashed off , after which she never came back . 
Time rushed by like running water . Imperceptibly , ten years went by in a flash . 
She had forgotten the incident , still living there as before , she led a calm and peaceful life . 
One afternoon , there was a knocking on the outside door . 
Opening the door to her apartment , she saw a pretty young woman she did not know . The girl was smiling broadly and in her hands she held a stack of presents . 
" Who are you looking for ? " 
she asked with uncertainty . 
The young girl excitedly gave a long explanation . 
To her surprise , from the unfamiliar young lady 's story she suddenly realized that the young woman was actually the little girl from that year . Ten years later , she had graduated from university without difficulty and had now come especially to call on her . 
The young woman 's eyes glistened with tears as she said in a gentle voice : " Although I still don 't understand even today why you were willing to pass yourself off as my mother and come to my rescue , but for the last ten years I had a constant feeling that I wanted to cry out ' Mother ' to you . " 
The teacher 's eyes started to cloud over as well . 
Somewhat curious , she asked : " If I hadn 't helped you that day , what would have been the result ? " 
The young woman 's face instantly darkened and she lightly shook her head , saying : " I 'm not sure . Maybe I would have gone on doing stupid things , or I might even have died . " 
A violent shiver went through the teacher 's heart , then she rejoiced to herself . 
The impetuous decision that she had made back then had unexpectedly had such an influence on a person 's entire life . 
Looking at the happy smile on the young woman 's face , she also began to smile .

While the world is full of lies and cheating that fill the air like junk messages , Buddha says , " Who would enter hell but I would enter it ... " 
Whoever is willing to do that , I congratulate him . He will achieve Buddhahood sooner . 
Human nature is good at the outset . 
Everybody has a compassionate heart . 
The world is going to the dogs and people 's hearts have changed . 
Perhaps only by abandoning one 's own Buddha can one do a little good . 
< HEADLINE > Military Observation : How Long Can Iran Hold Out under US Air Attacks ? 
< POSTER > Yun Feiquan 
If we describe conventional war of attrition as causing the opponent to bleed to death , then from the outset modern warfare consists of shooting a gun toward the opponent 's head in order to render him a " vegetable " even before there is time to bleed . 
The disparity between the military capabilities of Iran and the US is not one of quantity , but rather in the understanding of modern war . 
Iran , which fought a victorless eight - year war with Iraq , seems not yet to have understood the true significance of modern hi - tech warfare . 
Following an analysis of US military deployments , Britain 's " International Intelligence - - Commentary " recently said that the US military is carrying out preparations to launch a large scale air assault on Iran ...... 
The current status of Iran 's air force is cause for concern . 
The present situation of Iran 's air force is quite similar to that of Iraq 's air force prior to the 2003 war . 
The country does not possess the capacity to research and develop modern weapons on its own and is also under an arms embargo imposed by the west . 
Once war breaks out , it is uncertain whether the antiquated planes in Iran 's air force will be able to take to the air to engage US forces . 
At present , Iran 's air - defense system consists primarily of an air force belonging to Iran 's regular forces , the land - based air - defense force and the air - defense capacity of the revolutionary guard . 
Of these , Iran 's air force presently has a manpower of 50,000 and more than 300 aircraft of various models . 
The most important aircraft models include US - manufactured F-4 Phantoms , F5 Tigers , F-14 Tomcats and Russian - manufactured Mig-29s . 
The land - based air - defense force is primarily equipped with surface - to - air missiles of the US - manufactured Hawk series and the British Rapier series , as well as a portion belong to the Russian - manufactured SAM series . 
With regards to the current status of Iran 's air - defense strength , analysis by individuals such as the US military expert Harold Hutchison and military expert [ Hela Muqixin ] of the [ Russian Political and Military Research Institute ] indicates that , viewed from the present situation , there are still holes in Iran 's air - defense capabilities and air - defense system . 
Hutchison says that with respect to overall capabilities , Iran 's air force simply is not on the same level as the US air force . 
A large number of the US - manufactured jetfighters that Iran is equipped with cannot be used because of a lack of spare parts and upgrading . 
The F-14 fighter was once the trump card of Iran 's air force , but today there are only ten or so that are able to fly . 
The dependability in actual combat of the AIM-54 Phoenix missiles they carry , known for their ultra - long distance attack capabilities , is also doubtful . 
[ Hela Muqixin ] points out however that the air - defense missile systems provided to Iran by the US in the 1970s and 1980s have lost their warfare capabilities because of a lack of spare parts . 
In addition , the other non - systematic air - defense weapons obtained from Russia and other countries are simply incapable of countering US forces possessing powerful electromagnetic countermeasure capabilities . 
Scraping Together a Military Affects Battle Capability 
Clearly , Iran 's government is also aware that its fate in a conflict depends upon whether it can defend the sky above and it has been carrying out eleventh - hour preparations by scraping together whatever it can find in order to build up its air - defense system . 
At present , its methods can be summarized into two devices : 
The first is an all - out effort to conceal key nuclear facilities and beef up their defense capabilities . 
According to a report in the British newspaper The Times , Iran has hidden the Natanz Nuclear Facility , the Isfahan Uranium Enrichment Center and other core components of their nuclear facilities eighteen meters underground and added a two - meter thick concrete protection shell . 
But the US military is one step ahead . As early as the 1991 Persian Gulf War , it saw the effectiveness of underground bunkers in anti - aircraft defense and rushed to develop various types of earth - penetrating bombs . 
After ten years of focused research , the US military has a full complement of strategies and weapons to counter reinforced underground bunkers . 
Iran has recently also bought a large amount of advanced air - defense weapons from Russia . 
Since the end of last year , Iran 's government has reached a series of agreements with Russia to purchase Pechora-2A air defense missile systems as well as 29 Tor-M1 air - defense missile systems valued at US $ 700m . 
However , modern warfare is a contest of system against system . 
The various air - attack weapons of the US military have all been developed by the country itself for its own benefit and , through many years of perfectioning in actual combat , they have been molded into an impressive war machine . 
On the other hand , Iran 's " up - to - date weapons " have been scraped together from other countries . Whether or not they can be made combat effective in such a short time is still in question . 
Iran 's Lags Behind Not Only in Weapons 
The concept of " air - land battle " was first raised in " Operations " , published by the US military in 1982 . It stresses reliance on strength in the air to carry out attacks against the enemy 's strategically valuable targets . This paralyses the other side 's command systems at the start of the war and turns the enemy 's conventional forces , even if they are superior , into a " slab of meat on a cutting board . " 
In the 1991 Persian Gulf War , the 1999 Kosovo War and the 2003 Iraq War , the US military did not concern itself with how many planes the opponent had , but rather the range of its own Tomahawk cruise missiles . 
Even if Iran 's government has prepared for a possible air attack and has begun to take steps to reinforce its air - defense capabilities , Iran , which fought to a stalemate in an eight - year war with Iraq , seems not to have fully understood the true meaning of modern hi - tech warfare . 
With the progress of the US military 's military transformation in recent years , the US military 's air - attack operations are completely different from the carpet bombing of the Vietnam War and instead rely on full - depth air assaults with various hi - tech weapons and modern information technology . 
Faced with this kind of air assault , how long Iran 's land - based air defense systems can hold out is an unknown .

< HEADLINE > Joining Hands with Google to Battle Microsoft : Will Dell Charge Microsoft " Top - Shelf Fees " ? 
< POSTER > Yun Feiquan 
Dell Inc . ( US : DELL ) and Google confirmed on Tuesday that Dell is currently testing PCs installed with Google 's software pack . 
This step could form a significant threat to Microsoft 's ( MicrosoftCorp . , MSFT ) dominant position in the PC software market . 
Dell spokesman Jess Blackburn said the company is currently evaluating Google 's software . 
After the software has been installed , the PC - user will be able to use the software to conduct searches on the Internet as well as search through information stored on the PC . 
Blackburn confirmed that the software being evaluated by the company includes a Google - supported Dell homepage , a Google desktop search tool and a Google tool bar . 
At the same time , Google spokesman Jon Murchinson also confirmed that the company was working with Dell in testing a software bundle developed by Google . 
Earlier , a report in the Wall Street Journal had said that IT upstart Google was in talks with Dell and Hewlett - Packard in an attempt to convince the computer manufacturing giants to install Google software in their computers . 
According to an insider quoted by the Wall Street Journal , in order to achieve this end , Google may have to pay up to US $ 3bn over the next three years . 
However , the two companies have not disclosed any relevant details . 
Furthermore , HP still refuses to issue a comment . 
Microsoft spokesman Neil Charney refused to comment on the above information . 
Currently , Microsoft is planning to launch a search tool for the next generation of its Windows operating system and strengthen the development of its online business . 
On the day of the news statement , shares in Google fell another 4.46 % to US $ 367.92 . 
Shares in Microsoft fell that day by 1 % to close at US $ 26.94 . 
Some analysts say that Google is eagerly seeking to expand in a direction beyond web searching and that linking up with Dell and other PC giants could prompt Google to threaten Microsoft in its core businesses . 
Matt Rosoff , analyst with the market research firm Directions on Microsoft , says that Microsoft is unquestionably concerned and worried by Google 's eagerness to expand into other sources of revenue . 
But other analysts strongly disagree . 
Charles Di Bona , analyst with market research firm Sanford C. Bernstein , says that it is still too early to talk about Google shaking Windows ' dominate position . 
Reporter Handbook : Is Google shaking up Microsoft 's landscape ? 
Hui Zhengyi 
Without doubt , the computer has become a necessity in modern man 's life and work . 
But while everybody has become familiar with operating computers , only a small portion of people understand the working principles behind a computer . 
Just like with an " idiot " camera , if the interface is friendly and the software is convenient and quick to use , the vast majority of " newbies " can find their way around the black box that is a computer . 
For this reason , the software originally installed by the PC manufacturer more often than not determines the usage habits of most consumers . 
Indeed , it was through this measure that Microsoft took firm hold of the market for PC operating systems . 
Now , Microsoft 's new rival , Google , also intends to use this method to take a piece of the pie . 
In regards to this , a well - known organization in the Taiwanese economic media recently made an interesting analogy . 
" Dell , HP and other computer manufacturers are starting to treat the computers they produce as supermarket shelves and they are charging 'top shelf fees ' to software companies . 
The winning bidder can cause its software to appear in the 'crucial ten minutes ' after the user turns on the new computer and thereby induce the consumer to use their product . 
This type of fee method is like the top - shelve fees charged by supermarkets to food companies . " 
Without doubt , this phenomenon indicates that Microsoft 's control is being shaken . 
Microsoft 's managers have warned Bill Gates , saying that if Google starts paying money to PC manufacturers in order to have computers shipped with Google software installed , then Microsoft 's position as overlord will ultimately be threatened . 
Whatever the final outcome , Microsoft 's easy days safely perched at the top of the ladder might become history . 
After all , keeping a market is much more difficult than creating a market ¡ £

The Sword of Righteousness : Outlook for 2006 
Author : Sword of Righteousness 
I remember that at the beginning of 2005 Hong Kong 's Apple Daily carried an article titled " Falun Rotates Continuously and Its Gong May Be Able to Defeat a Regime " . 
The article states that 2004 was a year in which Falun Gong advanced triumphantly . 
The article lists examples of various occasions and situations where suppression of the Falun Gong movement by mainland China 's overseas officials failed and relates how Falun Gong practitioners speaking the truth around the world have caused mainland China to completely lose face . 
But 2004 doesn 't seem to have been anything special when compared to the powerful momentum of 2005 's Withdraw - from - the - Party Movement , which was caused by the book Nine Commentaries on the Communist Party . 
So , what will 2006 bring ? 
We can probably get a hint of how this year will develop from two events that occurred at the start of the year . 
One was the publication of " On Eliminating Evil " by the creator of Falun Gong . The article pronounced that , following July 20, 1999 , the final days of mainland China 's secret agents were nigh . 
As for this article , many people may half believe it or disbelieve it . 
But regardless of whether it is believed or not , history and facts will prove it ! 
Of course , the Chinese Communist Party 's secret agents are like rats that live in the sewers . 
Their " natural or accidental " death will not attract the attention of society and public opinion . 
But the large scale striking down or repentance of the CCP 's overseas secret agents will inevitably deliver a heavy blow and a great shock to the power - wielding strata of the CCP . 
Frightened by the awe - inspiring threat of being struck down , they have no choice but to carefully consider their own means of escape and survival - - - withdrawing from the Party , defecting and fighting against the CCP . 
For this reason , the CCP 's " ultra - stable bureaucratic organization " , held together by squalid self interest , will start to move toward shakiness , disintegration and collapse ! 
Another event was the human - rights hunger - strike protest movement launched by Gao Zhisheng . 
It erupted suddenly and initially wasn 't well - regarded , but it unexpectedly received an enthusiastic response from around the world as well as a collective response from people from all walks of life and various influential bodies . 
If this movement can become a bond bringing together the suffering people and various influential bodies fighting for justice , and can be made stronger , then there might be hope that the outside force that deals the final blow to the CCP , an evil regime in a very precarious situation , may take shape from here . 
If it can be said that 2005 was the year that the Communist Party was destroyed at the spiritual level , then in 2006 things will have entered into the stage where the Communist Party is destroyed at the spiritual and material level . 
Following further dissemination of the Nine Commentaries and growth in the wave of withdrawals from the party , the disintegration of the CCP and the consolidation of external forces fighting for justice , the countdown has begun for the end of the lifespan of the fiendish CCP ! 
The will of heaven and the will of the people have merged . The strength of the spirits and the strength of man are joining together . 
The heavenly sword is pointing straight at the demon CCP ! 
If it can be said that 2004 was a year of marching forward in militant song and 2005 was a year of moving forward with great momentum , then what will be the closing assessment of 2006 ? 
I hope it is an earthshaking radical change and triumphant return in victory !

Title : Xu Zhiyong : A Letter to Li Qun , Party Secretary of the Linyi CPC Municipal Committee - - By Using Hooligan Tactics , You Will Harm Yourselves Too . 
Website of origin : yjrg.net ( Wed Feb 8 13:56:14 2006 ) , current website ( yjrg.net ) 
As of yesterday , the government of Linyi , of which you are the leader , has held Chen Guangcheng under illegal house arrest for 165 days . 
You have joined with hooligan and gangland elements to illegally imprison a law - abiding citizen who is completely blind . 
You have cut his home 's telephone line and installed mobile phone interrupters in his courtyard . 
On several occasions , you have also beat him or members of his family . 
Your barbaric acts have transgressed the lowest limits of civilized society . 
At the beginning of October, 2005 , you employed hooligan gangland tactics to beat the lawyer Li Fangping and myself , but we have been patient and have always done our best to understand the difficult situation you are in . For a period of time , we even tolerated that you had placed Chen Guangcheng under house arrest . 
But 165 days have gone by and you still haven 't restrained yourselves . On the contrary , you have intensified your efforts . 
You have dispatched large contingents of police and thugs to harass the villagers . 
You have continued to arrest and beat villagers . 
You have gone too far ! 
Today , as you continue to organize underworld thugs to surround Chen Guangcheng , we clearly warn you that thuggish underworld tactics will in turn come back to hurt you . 
You need to rethink this affair from its beginning . 
Province wide , Linyi ranks last in planned parenthood . 
As municipal party secretary , it is understandable that you are somewhat anxious . 
But you are mistaken in your belief that the people of Linyi are of such low upbringing that it is necessary to use violence and coercion to implement state laws and policies . 
If citizens do not act in concert with the actions of government , in the end whose fault is it ? 
Is it because the citizens are of low upbringing or is it because for a long time the government has engaged in so much lying and deception that its public credibility is too low ? 
Assuming that ten years ago the same type of actions by government didn 't seem so outrageous , don 't you feel that , in 2005 , when Chinese society has made clear progress and human - rights guarantees have been written into the constitution , your savage acts seem ludicrous ? 
Think about it for a moment . How is it that only you people in Linyi dare to act this way ? 
How is it that only you people in Linyi are unable to enforce the law using democratic and legal methods ? 
In the wake of the reports by Chen Guangcheng and other courageous citizens regarding the savage enforcement of laws , the brave intercedence by Teng Biao and other legal personnel to protect the rights of citizens , as well as the conclusions drawn from the investigation by the State Family Planning Commission , the city of Linyi could have , in good faith , offered an explanation and reached a compromise with the public . 
When all is said and done , family planning is a difficult problem that is specific to China . 
Likewise , we can all empathize with the difficult situation you are in . 
But you nevertheless went on to employ outrageous measures - - arresting Chen Guangcheng and bringing him back from Beijing to be held prisoner , then attempting to have him found guilty of illegally revealing state secrets . 
Don 't you find it quite ludicrous to accuse a blind man from a poor mountain village of that crime ? 
Actually , if you had truly corrected your errors , if you had acted correctly , would you fear the criticism of a blind man ? 
Did you have to send several dozen people to keep watch over him twenty-four hours a day and , flustered and exasperated , even have him accused of a crime ? 
On October 4, 2005 , Attorney Li Fangping and I arrived in Dong Shigu Village . We put forth a very clear position in the hope of resolving the conflict . 
We suggested that we could first talk with your officials to see what thoughts and demands you had . 
We took the initiative of suggesting that we could help you persuade Chen Guangcheng that there are some things he should not say . 
We hoped that you would not treat a blind person in such a manner . There should be concessions from both sides . 
But your decision - makers clung obstinately to their course . Furthermore , you unexpectedly came up with a " careful plan " - - beating us and detaining us illegally . 
Do you think you can intimidate us in this way ? 
We haven 't done anything illegal , 
so we have nothing to fear . 
Although the rule of law in China may not be perfect , but neither is it at the point of lawlessness . 
If you think you can use thuggish tactics to intimidate us , then you have greatly underestimated our determination and perseverance . 
If we want , there are many of us with abundant legal justifications to go to Linyi or visit Chen Guangcheng . 
You can beat a lawyer or an academic once , twice , three times , and each time there will be widespread attention and reporting . 
Do you really dare to beat us ten times ? 
Isn 't it your official position that you are so worried about ? 
If the beatings actually result in somebody being injured , will your position be so assured ? 
You don 't listen to our rational advice , but instead resort to low - class ruffian tactics . Don 't you find this very foolish and also very dangerous ? 
I want to make it clear to you that there is a large group of outstanding citizens in China that are devoted to the just adherence to the rule of law . 
We are not afraid of ruffian criminal elements . 
We will not tolerate the brazen trampling of the lowest limits of human civilization . 
If you go too far , we will confidently and calmly step forward , group after group , to welcome your clubs until the moment that you shrink back . 
You should understand clearly that the use of hooligan tactics is in no way a good thing for you . 
Don 't think that after you retreat behind the scenes you will be able to break off your involvement with those local ruffians that beat villagers . 
Finally , we also want to remind you that you should treat Chen Guangcheng well . 
Blind since childhood , he graduated from collegial studies in Chinese medicine and then taught himself law and English . In the past , he brought legal action against the Beijing Subway Company in order to fight for the rights of blind people and also had running water installed for the villagers . He has become known near and far as " Attorney Chen " . 
You have unexpectedly mobilized unabashed flunkies to spread rumors and slander him on the Internet and have attempted to have him sentenced with the crime of illegally providing secrets to foreigners . Don 't you think that in doing so you have gone too far ? 
Your house arrest of Chen Guangcheng is illegal . It is also dangerous for you yourself . 
At first , you were fully capable of releasing him . 
Inasmuch as the savage enforcement of the law had already ceased , he could criticize all he wanted , but how long would he go on ? 
But you are now steadily denigrating your own image . 
Until Cheng Guangcheng obtains his freedom , you will not have a day of peace . 
You have persecuted him enough . 
If you try to have him convicted of a crime or attempt to use further thuggish tactics , we will not fold our arms and stand by .

< HEADLINE > ( fwd ) Does the Chinese Nation Deserve Democracy ? 
< POSTER > Explore the road to the peaceful liberation of China and advance the spiritual emancipation of the countrymen . 
With great disappointment , I admit that the Chinese nation does not deserve democracy ! ! ! 
Isn 't this what the people posting articles here have been doing ? 
The pity is that there won 't be many people ( compared to a population of 1.4 billion ) coming online to read them . 
And there are even fewer people among the web surfers who care about or take part in such topics . I dare say , less than 1 % of them ! 
Let alone the fact that this network is protected by the Golden Shield Project , which is the largest , most complete , most invested and best quality system in the world ! 
Indeed . 
I agonized , despaired , felt helpless and even thought of succumbing . But if we want to lead a life fit for humans , who can we count on to fight but ourselves ? 
Man proposes and God disposes . Yet even if I failed , I would hold myself to blame and deserve the life of a dog if I did not struggle for my own ideals . 
To struggle for something just in itself adds happiness to one 's life , at least in terms of one 's self - judgment in one 's own heart . 
Actually , I have absolutely no need to worry about the future of China , 
because the global environment is already such that it will not permit the existence of a regime that has failed to hold elections for so long . 
It is merely a matter of time . 
I just sigh that the Chinese nation could have been so lucky that , at every turn of history , it could always be led by world - class demons onto a marrow - and - blood - sucking road to hell . Some people actually call the heaps of white bones and pools of blood on this road glory and force us to feel proud of such glory . 
Although darkness exists everywhere , it is at its longest in China . 
Qin Shi Huang and Confucius caused the people to suffer so much . 
While Qin Shi Huang persecuted openly , Confucius brainwashed under the table . 
It 's not that the Chinese do not deserve democracy . It 's that they no longer have democracy in their genes , which have all degenerated . 
A country with a history of over 3,000 years would have become democratic long ago if its national culture had a component for democracy . 
What were the Chinese doing when Athens established its democratic system , when Rome founded the republic , when the British adopted their Charter , when the French issued the Declaration of Human Rights and when the Americans published the Declaration of Independence ? 
Before Mongolians invaded the Central Plains , they elected their monarch through the Kuraltai . In their early days , Manchurians practiced a democratic system of ministerial meetings . Why did all these fizzle out in the Han regions ? 
Chinese chase material goods and have no interest whatsoever in spiritual belief and political rights . 
You don 't believe it ? If the Chinese were given universal suffrage , they would sell it to you for a single pie . 
Five hundred thousand years later , it would need an earthquake for the Chinese to want democracy . So run while you can !

Dalai Lama 's Envoys Hold Closed Door Talks with Chinese Officials . 
Dalai Lama Stressed he Wants Autonomy , Not Independence , for Tibet . 
Envoys of Tibet 's exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama are in China for closed door talks with Chinese officials . Details have not yet been released . 
This is the fifth official meeting since China and the Dalai Lama 's exiled government resumed contacts in 2002 . 
But , as in the past , the two sides are meeting behind closed doors . No details have yet been disclosed . 
Reporters say the two sides have held talks on several occasions , but so far there have been no tangible results . 
The Dalai Lama , who is in exile in Northern India , says he wants autonomy , not independence , for Tibet ¡ £ 
China has refused to comment on the talks between the two sides . 
But analysts say Beijing wants dialogue , partly because it fears the death of the 70 - year - old spiritual leader in exile could lead to heightened sentiments among Tibetans unhappy with China rule . 
Cultural Identity 
The delegation from the Dalai Lama 's exiled government is led by Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari . He was also the lead delegate in earlier talks . 
A spokesman for the Tibetan government - in - exile said the round of talks that they had with Chinese officials in Switzerland in 2005 were very " intensive and frank " and this has given the Tibetan people hope . 
The spokesman said their ultimate hope is to resolve the relevant issues on the basis of a negotiated settlement with the Chinese leadership so that the Tibetan people will have the freedom to preserve what is important to them , which is their cultural identity .

Dalai Lama 's Envoy Reiterates Tibetan Independence is Not Being Sought 
Dalai Lama to Visit Washington This Month 
In the run - up to the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama 's trip to the US on November 8 , his envoy has said that the Tibetan government - in - exile is not seeking Tibet 's independence . 
Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said in Washington that he hopes that the Chinese government will truly protect Tibet 's unique culture and traditions . 
It is expected that during his visit to the US next week the Dalai Lama will discuss the Tibet issue with President Bush in the hope that Bush will press the Chinese government to give Tibet genuine autonomy . 
In July of this year , envoys of the Dalai Lama 's met with Beijing 's officials in Berne for their first direct contact . 
" Genuine Autonomy " 
Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said that in recent years talks between the Tibetan government - in - exile and the Chinese authorities has revealed some positive elements . 
The envoys of the Dalai Lama found that the leaders in Beijing , particularly the delegates of the CCP 's United Front Work Department , are more willing than in the past to listen to their opinions . 
But Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said the Tibetan government - in - exile and the Chinese government still have several differences of opinion and are still far - apart in their standpoints . 
He said that in the last five years the Tibetan government - in - exile has done its utmost to respond to China 's demands in order to create a favorable negotiating environment . 
In order to create a favorable negotiating environment on the Tibetan issue , China should refrain from blindly pressuring the Dalai Lama . 
He said the Dalai Lama does not seek independence for Tibet and that Tibet is still a part of China , but that the Chinese government must protect Tibet 's unique culture and " allow the Tibetan people genuine autonomy " . 
Furthermore , Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari said that some Chinese people think that once the Dalai Lama has died the Tibet issue will disappear . 
He said that this thinking is extremely dangerous because once the Dalai Lama is dead China will have lost a historic opportunity to solve the Tibet issue . 
He said that the Chinese government only needs to respond to the Dalai Lama 's demands and suggest a final means of resolution , then the Dalai Lama will no longer need to talk at the international level about the Tibet issue . 
< HEADLINE > The Key Tools of Democracy : Negotiation and Compromise ! (ZT) 
< POSTER > Hou Ze 
I 've just read a web friend 's posting in " Awe - inspiring Righteousness - - Mr. Li Guiren " 
His ( her ) original words were " negotiation and compromise are key tools of democracy . Otherwise , divisions due to differences of opinion result in the failure of democracy ! ! ! It is hoped that idealistic democracy advocates will pay close attention to this point ! " 
That this prosaic and colorless statement did not attract the interest of any web friends stired a succession of thoughts in my mind and filled me with regret . 
I think about China 's antiquity . I also think about the past in the west . 
I , who have started very few threads , could not resist using a new thread to respond to the posting by the original net friend . 
Let 's first take a look at antiquity in China . 
Everybody knows that in China , starting with the united centralized rule built by Qin Shi Huang , all subsequent dynasties operated according to this political framework . 
Although the Han Dynasty temporarily implemented a " dual system " ; that is , political system in which feudalism and centralism operated in parallel ; it finally ended up employing centralism . 
Under the historical conditions of that time , this kind of centralism had facets that were advanced or that promoted productivity and development . 
But we should also observe that more than two thousand years of this kind of system resulted in localities that lacked the creativity , initiative and motivation that they should have . Furthermore , it was impossible to tailor - make systems and policies so that they suited local development . 
A pyramid - shaped system of political rule also made it so that lower - level officials could only fix their gazes upward and in every regard take orders from their immediate superiors . 
Because the local county officials were all appointed by the central government , there was no room for coordination or negotiation between them , let alone with the common people . 
When the rights of peasants in ancient China were infringed upon , they could only grin and bear it . 
It was only when their most basic rights were threatened , such as by large scale famine , or when their right to life was being deprived due to tyranny or natural calamity , that they would rise in rebellion . 
In two thousand years , several turbulent peasant uprisings have swept across the entire country : from the unplanned Chen Sheng and Wu Guang Uprising to the preplanned Yellow Turban Rebellion , and then to the Huang Chao Rebellion in the Tang Dynasty and Li Zicheng , who was able to rule as emperor for a month as the result of an uprising . Besides Zhu Yuanzhang , none of the rebellions obtained a truly meaningful victory . 
Even the Ming Dynasty that Zhu Yuanzhang initiated was nothing more than the reincarnation of previous dynasties , with no change in political institutions . 
Zhu Yuanzhang , born a commoner and uncultured for the most part , manipulated China 's ancient centralized system with a perverse relish , taking it to its extreme limits . The vigor of the Tang Dynasty , characterized by openness , freedom and tolerance , was lost and replaced by a deathly spiritlessness . 
All at once , the atmosphere of free speech disappeared from China 's vast area . 
Human nature was suppressed to the highest degree . 
People became timorous , extremely afraid , and unwilling to say too much . 
This was the outcome of the only peasant uprising to succeed in two thousand years : in one go it turned the Chinese people into the living dead . 
Now let 's look at Western Europe 's medieval period , which has been called the Dark Ages . 
The Middle Ages in Western Europe was a thousand year period that occurred after nomadic peoples destroyed Western Rome and that did not have the slightest connection to ancient Greece and ancient Rome . 
This period was characterized by feudalism ; that is , the granting of feudal land titles . 
As titles were subdivided into increasingly lower strata , the lords at each lower stratum possessed an increased amount of autonomy . 
Because they were capable of balancing , restricting and depending on each other both vertically and horizontally , even feudal lords with a few square kilometers of land as well as the dukes , marquises , earls , viscounts and barons that came to power possessed the conditions and clout to win from the king the rights that were rightfully theirs , thereby producing a situation where aristocrats and the king sat together to negotiate for their respective benefit , a situation that has ne 
That is , mutual accommodation and concession , and not the use of violent methods to beat down and replace the other party . 
In this way , with the drawing up various agreements , power steadily moved down into the hands of aristocrats and commoners . The power of the aristocrats and commoners gradually increased while the king 's power progressively decreased . 
By the time the Queen of England came along , she only occupied a passive position and did not have any real power . 
This is how democracy was gradually achieved ! 
Let 's take another look back in order to make a comparison . In ancient China , with all power concentrated in the hand of the emperor ( with the exception of Li Shimin ) and almost no aristocracy , it was almost impossible for peasants to sit with the emperor over a pot of tea or a glass of wine and light - heartedly make mutual compromises and concessions or formulate agreements that satisfied both sides . 
Under such circumstances , when they were being deprived of their right to life , they had no choice but to adopt violent methods to overthrow the current dynasty in an attempt to supplant it . 
This outcome repeated itself again and again , from the high point of the Tang Dynasty to the morbidity of the Ming Dynasty . 
If we compare European and Chinese history , we discover that there is practically no western country with an ancient period where the contradictions between the rulers and the ruled were as sharp as in China . 
There is no western country that experienced an endless succession of peasant uprisings like China did . 
When contradictions arose between the royal house and the peasants in the ancient history of western countries , the first thing that aristocrats and commoners thought of when they were making an appeal for their own interests was to reach a solution through negotiation and make mutual concessions in order to gradually obtain greater benefits . Rarely did they employ violent methods . 
Understanding this , as we enter the 21st century , we can still see on the Internet that there are some democracy militants who , having inherited the ultra - absolute totalitarian thinking of the Ming Dynasty , 
and whose bodies have been invaded by the poison of the Cultural Revolution , are incapable as democratic warriors of talking about anything but " overthrow " and " toppling " . 
But this kind of thinking is the greatest barrier to democracy , because these people do not understand that negotiation and cooperation are the most important means and channel to realizing democracy . 
< HEADLINE > Cao Xiaoming - - Rich Cultural Activities in the Countryside : Who Will " Pay the Bill " ? 
< POSTER > Hou Ze 
During this year 's Spring Festival , I was fortunate enough to spend the New Year in the countryside visiting some family and friends . 
While being caught up in the rich New Year 's atmosphere in China 's countryside , I also became worried about the lack of interesting cultural activities in rural areas . 
I discovered in a friend 's village that in past years the village would set out on its own each Spring Festival to organize the villagers in putting on a local play called " The Galloping Horse Lantern " . 
The play takes as its subject the characters from the Three Kingdoms . Adults and children can all enact a role in the play . The villagers never tire of watching . 
In this way , there are several " Galloping Horse Lantern " performance troupes throughout the county . They perform not only in their own village , but also travel to other villages , with the exchange between villages becoming very lively . 
But this year the village did not organize a troupe . 
, It seems that it took a lot of money just to buy the costumes for " The Galloping Horse Lantern " . In the past , the villagers would each contribute some cash , but now the costumes are tattered to the point that they can no longer be worn . 
A house - to - house appeal was made to the villagers to again fork out money , but none was willing . A similar situation has arisen in other villages throughout the county . 
Without the " Galloping Horse Lantern " , the village has suddenly become cold and cheerless . 
The adults have started playing mahjong . 
The children have also started playing cards . 
The villagers all say that this New Year 's was dull . 
Other than setting off firecrackers , everybody just played mahjong and that became the general backdrop of Chinese New Year in the countryside . 
In addition , repeated bans have failed to halt a gambling craze that is showing a tendency to spread . Games involving upwards of ten thousand yuan have become a common occurrence , with the large number of returning migrant workers playing a particularly important role in many games . 
In this way , money earned from a year of hard work is squandered . 
Also , family squabbles stemming from gambling sometimes occur . Some even descend into tragedies where families are split or life is lost . 
Some farmers say that they gamble not only during the Spring Festival , but also often during the slack season . 
If they don 't gamble , they don 't have anywhere to go . 
In the countryside , it is too difficult to organize cultural activities or find entertainment . 
Not only is there a lack of facilities and funds , but also nobody volunteers to handle the organization . 
In this respect , the method used in Jiangxi is doubtlessly welcome news for rural dwellers . 
In order to enrich the cultural life of the rural population , the Jiangxi provincial government has not only implemented as of September last year a program of " government funding , market operation , town construction of stages and villagers watching plays " , 
but also organizes each year a special fund of at least Rmb60 million for rural cultural projects in order to provide the rural population high quality cultural products . 
With the New Year , it added an additional Rmb40 million , making a rural cultural project fund totaling Rmb100 million . 
For the rural population , the fruits of this special fund are also very substantial : 
They invite various types of professional performance troupes to come to the villages to perform . Each village cannot have less than four performances each year . 
They invite screening teams from different levels of movie companies and organizations to come to the villages to show movies . Each administrative village cannot have less than six screenings of entertainment and educational films each year . 
They organize and hold popular cultural events that have local character . Each village cannot have less than two or three each year . 
From this " purchase list " , we can easily see that the government has not thrown money at the problem , but rather has expended a lot of energy to use limited funds in an incisive way in order to deliver a cultural feast with good value to the vast rural population . They have performed an important task . 
Now , not an individual among the vast rural population is not ecstatic about the waiver of the grain tax . 
If governments could do like Jiangxi and make greater " purchases " to enrich the cultural life of the rural population , it would be another gift from heaven for those living in the countryside , 
and this " gift " would not only free the farmers from the mahjong table , the movement in cultural activities would also add another brick in socialist construction of a new countryside .

Kidnap Warning for Wang Peirong 's Child Was a False Alarm 
After nine o'clock on the evening of January 24, 2006 , the child of Wang Peirong finished relating the following : 
While making up classes in physics at Xuzhou 's No. 3 Middle School on the morning of January 24, 2006 , Wang Peirong 's child was called out by the entrance guard . 
The entrance guard informed Wang Peirong 's child that three unidentified men had said the following to the entrance guards of No. 3 Middle School : Wang Peirong 's child , Wang Tianjiao , has not returned home for three days because the father and mother of Wang Peirong 's child are not getting along . 
Now her mother is missing . We are leaders from her mother 's work unit and want to enter No. 3 Middle School to get Wang Peirong 's child . 
Wang Peirong 's child told the entrance guards that what the three men had said was completely untrue and she refused to go with the three men . 
With the help of the entrance guards of No. 3 Middle School , Wang Peirong 's child was not taken away . 
Wang Peirong 's child phoned her mother 's leader at noon to find out what was going on . The leader denied sending anybody to Xuzhou 's No. 3 middle school . 
Wang Peirong 's child asked her for the phone number of her father 's leader . 
Wang Peirong 's child called her father 's leader . 
Wang Peirong 's child said : Three people came to No. 3 Middle School to take me away . 
The leader asked : Why didn 't you go with them ? 
Wang Peirong 's child answered : If I had gone with them I would be dead for sure . 
When she had finished speaking , Wang Peirong 's child hung up the phone . 
Hearing a description of the events from his child , Wang Peirong felt that the situation was serious and reported it to the police . 
On January 25 , the local police station received feedback that the story told by Wang Peirong 's child was essentially true . 
The police station asked the Kuangda Security Department if they had sent people to the No. 3 Middle School to get Wang Peirong 's child . They responded that they hadn 't . 
The police station again asked the Kuangda Security Department if any of its branch units had sent people to No. 3 Middle School to get Wang Peirong 's child . They again answered that they hadn 't . 
Through them , the relevant departments warned Wang Peirong and his family to pay attention to their safety . 
Following the event , the leaders of the relevant departments of Xuzhou municipality paid close attention . 
The criminal investigation department of the Xuzhou Public Security Bureau excluded the possibility of a kidnap attempt against the child . 
Wang Peirong thanked the relevant department heads of the Xuzhou municipality and the criminal investigation department of Xuzhou Public Security Department . 
It was a false alarm . The main cause of the false alarm was possibly the entrance guards of No. 3 Middle School . 
The criminal investigation department of the Xuzhou Public Security Bureau has learned : On January 24 , the leader of the College of Science , which is Wang Peirong 's work unit , and three other individuals urgently needed to find Wang Peirong ( Wang Peirong still does not know why they were looking for him ) and could not find him by telephone . They thought of going to No. 3 Middle School to find the teacher of Wang Peirong 's child in order to ask if Wang Peirong 's child was still in 
A weighty topic : Why is the risk involved in corruption relatively low while the cost of fighting corruption is high ? 
http://bbs.people.com.cn/bbs/ReadFile?whichfile=44796&typeid=39 
Under the present cadre system and anti - corruption system , what corrupt officials need to be worry about is a few relevant officials overseeing them , not the broad masses of people . 
Therefore , once they feel that they have successfully hoodwinked or contented those few officials that can determine their fate , they can they feel reassured and unafraid as they carry out their great project of corruptly and illegally collecting wealth while disregarding the feelings of the nearby masses of people . 
On the contrary , if the common people who don 't hold any power come across an injustice and stand up against corruption , they will possibly provoke an extremely brutal reprisal , 
or be branded by the government and end up at any time being crushed in defeat before obtaining any victory . 
A comparison of the two : engaging in corruption is relatively risk free , while the cost of resisting corruption on the other hand is high .
