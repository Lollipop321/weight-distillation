the two met in 1999 , when jo@@ hn@@ son was still a career military man stationed in ba@@ h@@ rain .
after he met this teenage princess , the pair fell in love and his life thus changed tremendously .
since the royal family for@@ b@@ ade the union of these two young lovers , jo@@ hn@@ son smuggled mer@@ i@@ am out of her country and into the united states by disgu@@ ising her in a fl@@ annel shirt and a baseball cap , and forging her military identification papers .

this week 's euro@@ zone indicators shows a continually weak european economy
economists said that the economic indicators to be announced by euro@@ zone this week would provide further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing economic output , while british data is expected to show a growth in industrial activities .
they said that economic output data from the largest euro@@ zone countries will continue to show great volatility every month , but the long - term trend will demonstrate a slow down in economic growth .
this week 's key figures will be in germany . the closely watched economic expectations index , which is expected to be released on the 7 th by the z@@ ew economic institute , will provide the first evidence of december 's economic confidence in europe .
the z@@ ew index plummeted to 13.@@ 9 in november from 3@@ 1.3 in the previous month .
in a recent survey , economists indicated that the substantial appreciation of the euro will continue to affect economic confidence , thus there is no reason to anticipate a rebound in the economic expectations index .
a b@@ n@@ p economist said , " given that the main factors neg@@ atively affecting economic confidence - the appreciation of the euro , uncertainty over global growth , and the weak labor market and increasing unemployment in germany - have remained a drag on future growth expectations over the december survey period , a strong rebound is unlikely . "
according to a survey conducted by af@@ x news , the af@@ p financial news subsidiary , economists believed that this index would drop again to 11 in december from 13.@@ 9 in the prior month .
nevertheless , tea@@ ther of u@@ bs investment bank said that the z@@ ew economic expectations index of germany might even fall to zero in december .
tea@@ ther said , " according to our view , expectations of future german economic activity , as reflected in the z@@ ew survey of analysts and financial market participants , will continue to fall . "
ukrainian crisis creates east - west tensions ; expected to be on os@@ ce meeting agenda
russia has repeatedly accused the west of interfering in eastern european affairs . the issue has become the focus of attention due to the political crisis in ukraine . it will also be at the top of the agenda of tomorrow 's annual ministers meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe ( os@@ ce ) .
the cre@@ eping western influence into corners of europe previously considered by russia as its back@@ yard , such as the bal@@ tic states , ge@@ or@@ gia , and central asia , has long dis@@ gr@@ un@@ tled russia . thus , recent incidents in ukraine will probably dominate the two - day os@@ ce meeting to be held in so@@ fia , the capital city of bulgaria .
the supreme court of ukraine has made the dramatic decision to order a re@@ run of the recent run@@ off of the presidential election . prior to that , the european union has already appealed to the os@@ ce member states to prepare their observers to " take action as quickly and efficiently as possible .

congress ' vote on intelligence overhaul bill this week a crucial test for bush
the u@@ .@@ s . congress will push hard to pass the intelligence overhaul bill this week . the bill is an ambitious second - term agenda for re@@ public@@ an president bush . his support among the re@@ public@@ an congressmen will face its first major test after his re@@ election .
ke@@ an , the former re@@ public@@ an new j@@ er@@ sey governor responsible for the investigation of the terrorist attacks in new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 , said during an interview with the press that the issue of the intelligence overhaul bill is that congress has to approve it . this matter alone presents unfavorable signs for future cooperation between the two parties and the president 's domestic policies .
ke@@ an said , " congress becomes dys@@ functional if the president and congress ca n 't get these big issues taken care of , and then we 're all in trouble . "
he told the new york daily news , " it 'll be a long time before there 's another bill with the support of the re@@ public@@ an and democratic leadership in both houses and the support of 80 percent of the american people in the polls . "
several congressmen stated yesterday that if this ground@@ breaking reform bill failed , it would delay the overhaul of the u@@ .@@ s . anti@@ qu@@ ated intelligence network for months , years , or even kill its existence entirely .
har@@ man , ranking democr@@ at on the house intelligence committee , stated on c@@ nn , " if the bill is n 't passed this week , it dies . "
the congress will try to pass the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 again on the 6 th and the 7 th . it will then adjourn until next year .
if it is vetoed , the bill will be annul@@ led and the congress will re@@ write a new bill in the 2005 session .
ukrainian opposition party firmly rejects constitutional - reform bill that drastically cur@@ bs presidential power
the pro - western opposition party in ukraine today insisted that it would not accept the constitutional amendments advanced by outgoing president ku@@ chma before the re@@ run of the presidential election .
this constitutional reform will strip most of the power currently held by the president .
after the supreme court annul@@ led the results of the ri@@ gged run@@ off election held on november 21 , the central election commission ordered a re@@ run on december 26 . opposition leader y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko is again at lo@@ gg@@ er@@ heads with ku@@ chma .
ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ enko , y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko 's ally , stated , " if the constitutional amendment is passed in its current form , all the powers of the president would be transferred to the parliament . this would be unacceptable . "
she told reporters , " we hope that the president could appoint the chief of the intelligence bureau and the prosecutor - general so we can fight corruption and eliminate groups that control ukrainian politics and business circles . "
due to his worry that the opposition party may win in the presidential election , ku@@ chma , who has close ties with russia , advanced the constitutional reform ahead of the re@@ election .
yesterday , opposition party members in the parliament refused to vote on the constitutional - reform bill put forward by the government . as a result , the parliament will recess for 10 days .
according to the constitutional amendment bill , the authority to appoint all top officials except the prime minister , the defense minister , and the foreign minister will be transferred from the hand of the president to the parliament , in which pro - government forces currently have a close majority .
according to the constitutional amendment bill , the appointment of the prime minister , defense minister , and foreign min@@ ster by the president have to be approved by the parliament , while the parliament can also name their own candidates .
third week of ukrainian political crisis ; opposition party calls for a continuous resistance
the chaos sparked off by the presidential election in ukraine has entered its third week . opposition leader y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko called on his supporters to continue their street protests and their blockade of the presidential palace and government buildings , until outgoing president k@@ ush@@ ma fires prime minister y@@ anu@@ kov@@ y@@ ch and his cabinet , and to take actions to ensure justice in the upcoming re@@ run of the presidential run@@ off election .
tens of thousands of y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko 's supporters have gathered in the capital city of ki@@ ev for two weeks . they surround government buildings and camp out on major roads designed by russian specialists for viewing military marches . their demonstration of the power of the masses has forced the supreme court to declare the presidential election on november 21 invalid . the central election commission ordered a new election on december 26 and the parliament has approved the dismissal of y@@ anu@@ kov@@ y@@ ch . however , k@@ ush@@ ma still has not signed the administrative order to replace the successor , whom he fostered personally .
y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko told the supporters gathered at the independence square tonight that k@@ ush@@ ma should replace his government and reshuffle the central election commission , and that both the parliament and k@@ ush@@ ma should agree to amend the election law in order to prevent any electoral fraud .
in his speech that unveiled the run@@ off on december 26 , he stated , " before these decisions are implemented , we should not discuss lifting the blockade of government buildings and the presidential palace .
during these 2 weeks , this square has demonstrated its ardent love for ukraine , and the civil awareness of tens of millions of ukrain@@ ians who can defend their choices . "
he stated , " we are going through a struggle between the good and evil powers . the whole world is che@@ ering for our victory and the entire world is proud of ukraine . "
while the opposition party exer@@ ts more pressure on the governing authorities backed by moscow , and y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko and k@@ ush@@ ma are at a deadlock once again on constitutional reform , polish president kw@@ asni@@ ewski , li@@ thu@@ anian president ad@@ am@@ k@@ us , and russian envoy gr@@ y@@ z@@ lo@@ v are scheduled to arrive in ki@@ ev on the 6 th for another effort at mediation .
egy@@ pt announces breakthrough in middle east peace predicament
egy@@ pt stated that a new structure is anticipated for the middle east peace agreement .
it also said that it might dispatch an ambassador to israel again in the near future to resume full diplomatic relations , which have been severed for four years .
the state - run middle east news agency in egy@@ pt cited " senior " egy@@ ptian figures as saying that all parties seeking a peace plan are gradually coming to a consensus regarding the overall reconciliation .
the middle east news agency stated , " egy@@ pt , israel , palest@@ ine , and important international entities such as the united states and the european union have reached an important understanding and have agreed in principle to resolve the israel - palest@@ ine clashes completely . "
since the death of palestinian strong@@ man ar@@ afat last month , the international community resumes the advancement of the middle east peace policy , hoping to end prolonged blood@@ shed between israel and palest@@ ine as soon as possible .
the middle east news agency reported that officials expect " the preparation work will continue until july and political action will be taken afterwards . "
the middle east news agency indicated that afterwards , parties that are concerned about the middle east peace progress , including israel , palest@@ ine , egy@@ pt , the united states , russia , and a few european countries , would hold a meeting in washington .
it is expected that the agenda for the meeting will include a " ceasefire on both sides , " and palestinian authorities will " stop anti - israeli attacks and strengthen its control on the ga@@ za strip and west bank . "
in regards to this , the middle east news agency reported that israeli prime minister shar@@ on promised , " as long as palestinian authorities honor the ar@@ mis@@ tice agreement and have control over their territories , israel will stop its military action on the palest@@ inians . "
over 1 billion children worldwide suffer from war , poverty , and hi@@ v / aids
an annual report published by un@@ ic@@ ef today shows that over 1 billion children , half of the world 's children , suffer from poverty , war , and hi@@ v / aids .
un@@ ic@@ ef pointed out that the rights of children to have a healthy and protected up@@ bringing stated clearly in the 1989 convention on the rights of the child are frequently denied , partly because of governments ' failure to implement human rights and economic reforms .
during the launch of the annual report in london , un@@ ic@@ ef executive director b@@ ell@@ amy pointed out , " when half the world 's children are growing up hungry and unhealthy , when schools have become targets and whole villages are being emp@@ tied by aids , we 've failed to deliver on the promise of childhood . "
b@@ ell@@ amy added , " too many governments are making deliberate choices that actually will hurt childhood . "
data compiled jointly by researchers at un@@ ic@@ ef , the london school of economics , and bri@@ st@@ ol university reveals a gr@@ u@@ esome picture of children in dangerous situations in most parts of the world .
researchers discovered that about 640 million children worldwide lack proper shelter , 400 million children do not have access to safe drinking water , 270 million children do not have health care services , and 140 million children ( mostly girls ) have never attended school .
researchers pointed out that a more serious fact is that at least 700 million children suffer from all forms of " extreme deprivation , " including lack of access to information and public sanitation facilities .
the 10 th annual report released by un@@ ic@@ ef today indicates that wars and hi@@ v / aids have destroyed all the networks that are usually able to protect children . moreover , children are often the direct victims of wars and hi@@ v / aids .
eu resists chinese pressure to lift arms embargo
the european union today rejected pressure from chinese premier wen ji@@ abao for a quick end of the arms embargo on china . however , it also indicated that it would strive toward lifting this 15 - year - old embargo .
the nether@@ lands , the eu rotating presidency , made the above statement after the sino - eu summit .
the nether@@ lands stated that how eu will end this embargo should not be wildly speculated .
the eu imposed the arms embargo on beijing after the 1989 tian@@ anmen square massacre .
even though the arms embargo issue had cast a shadow over the sino - eu summit , the two sides still signed a number of trade and other agreements .
both china and the eu claimed that these agreements have strengthened their " strategic partnership . "
in a joint declaration released after the summit with chinese premier wen ji@@ abao , the eu stated , " the eu side confirmed its political will to continue to work toward lifting the embargo . "
the declaration stated that the chinese delegate " welcomed the positive sign and considered it beneficial to the sound development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between china and the eu . "
wen ji@@ abao did not hide his dis@@ pleasure at the press conference after the summit . he said that this embargo " does not reflect the partnership between china and the eu . "
wen ji@@ abao stated , " the embargo is a product of the cold war . it neither reflects the current situation nor the partnership between china and the eu . "
some eu nations , spear@@ headed by france , encouraged the lifting of this arms embargo , stating that it is out - dated .
without the amendment and strengthening of eu 's related laws , critics worry that the lifting of the embargo could open the floo@@ dg@@ ates for arms sales and boost china 's military strength .
bal@@ ken@@ end@@ e , prime minister of the nether@@ lands , claimed , " i explained that within the eu there is a willingness to lift the embargo , but i also explained that this is related to adjusting the code of conduct on arms exports . "
preliminary findings : possible link of fol@@ ic acid to breast cancer , but results in@@ conclusive
a recent health study suggests that a b vitam@@ in ( fol@@ ic acid ) commonly used by pregnant women to prevent birth defects may increase the chance of breast cancer .
nonetheless , researchers stated that their results might be a chance finding , because other research suggests that fol@@ ic acid will in fact lower the risk of breast cancer . thus , they advised pregnant women to continue taking this supplement .
fol@@ ic acid naturally exists in dark green vegetables and it is already known in medical circles that this is an important aid in the development of the f@@ etus .
researchers from the university of bri@@ st@@ ol and the university of ab@@ er@@ deen in britain followed 3,000 women who had taken 5 mg or 0.2 mg dose of fol@@ ic acid or a placebo , mostly during their second and third tri@@ me@@ sters of pregn@@ ancies in the 1960 s .
this research , published in the british medical journal , showed that by september 2002 , those who had taken 5 mg d@@ oses of fol@@ ic acid were twice as likely to have breast cancer as those who took only the placebo .
ness , one of the researchers , stressed that these results present " preliminary findings that are intended to point the way toward further research . "
he stated , " it is entirely possible that this is a chance finding - - so further scientific studies are required to examine the association , if there is one , before we reach any conclusions . "
ness said that women planning to become pregnant should continue to take fol@@ ic acid suppl@@ ements .
he claimed that the current recommended dos@@ age and " the experimental dos@@ age are considerably different . "
according to the uk 's health standards , women planning to become pregnant and those who are in their first tri@@ me@@ ster of pregn@@ ancies should have 0.4 mg of fol@@ ic acid everyday , which is more than 10 times lower than the dos@@ age taken by the women in the above study .
two candidates face ukrainian presidential re@@ run in completely different mood
the two rivals who will face off for the ukrainian presidential re@@ run on the 26 th of this month are geared up for the match .
western - leaning opposition leader y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko is confident of winning while pro - russian current prime minister y@@ anu@@ kov@@ ich declared that he is no longer running for the " shameful " ruling party .
meanwhile , russian president pu@@ tin changed his attitude towards ukraine 's entering into the european union and expressed his pleasure to see it happen .
when asked about the percentage of votes he expected to get in the re@@ run , y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko told the reporters who filled the venue of the press conference , " conserv@@ atively speaking , i should have about 60 percent of the votes . "
on the other hand , the anxious - looking y@@ anu@@ kov@@ ich , who duc@@ ked several of the reporters ' questions , only said , " we will win as per god 's will " at the end .
y@@ anu@@ kov@@ ich , the original an@@ o@@ inted successor of current president ku@@ chma , has changed his course and cast himself as the candidate who is fighting against the opposition party and the ruling party .
he was close to mentioning names when he said , " i used to trust those cow@@ ards and tra@@ itors who worked in the government , but now i am very disappointed . this government is very shameful . "
ku@@ chma made a deal with the opposition party to transfer part of the presidential power to the parliament through a legislative amendment in order to end the opposition party 's large - scale protest and political turmoil that has lasted for two weeks since the presidential run@@ off on november 21 .
the supreme court also declared the original victory of y@@ anu@@ kov@@ ich invalid because of the ri@@ gged election process and ordered a re@@ run to be held .

this might be pow@@ ell 's last official overseas visit . the eu promised him that they will work towards easing strained ties ahead of u@@ .@@ s . president bush 's european visit next february .
nonetheless , differences between the two sides still exist .
du@@ t@@ ch foreign minister bo@@ t , whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency , said , " we have to intensify the dialogue and re@@ discover some common ground in the second term of president bush . "
eu external relations commissioner ms . wal@@ d@@ ner stated that she believed europe and the united states had already made some progress in " putting the difficult moments of the iraq crisis behind us . " however , she also realized that now is the " key moment in the eu - us relationship . "
bush will meet with eu and nato leaders in brussels on february 22 , 2005 .
pow@@ ell stated that bush 's visit aims at m@@ ending the f@@ issu@@ res caused by the ira@@ qi factors .
pow@@ ell has visited so@@ fia and brussels during this visit but has produced limited results in improving the relationships .
especially in brussels , pow@@ ell criticized the six anti - war nato members of hurting the " credibility and cohesion of the alliance " by not participating in the training exercises in iraq .
nevertheless , pow@@ ell insisted that his meeting has shown the commitment of the united states in re@@ establishing full diplomatic relationships .

roman@@ ian opposition candidate bas@@ escu won the close presidential election today . however , the mayor of bu@@ cha@@ rest , who holds a center - right position , will probably face huge challenges in forming a new government because of the multi - parti@@ ed and fr@@ agmented parliament .

tum@@ ult over past work unsettled : ol@@ i@@ ver stone seeks peace with turkey
movie director ol@@ i@@ ver stone is trying to use the opportunity of promoting his new movie " al@@ ex@@ ander " in ist@@ an@@ bul to make peace with turkey .
his screen@@ play for the classic " midnight express " has been criticized as tarn@@ ishing the image of turkey .
he told af@@ p in an interview here , " i never intended the screen@@ play to be against turkey . it was against injustice everywhere . "
tur@@ ks have condemned stone since the first screening of this award - winning movie in 1978 .
this movie was adapted from the memoirs of bil@@ ly ha@@ yes .
ha@@ yes , an american youth who was caught at the ist@@ an@@ bul airport for attempting to smugg@@ le h@@ ash@@ ish out of the country , was sentenced to 30 years in a turk@@ ish prison following a protracted legal battle .
turk@@ ish critics accused stone of taking liberties with re@@ writing ha@@ yes ' original work into a rac@@ ist screen@@ play . all the turk@@ ish characters in the movie are depicted as vill@@ ains without exception .
the movie is also full of hor@@ rif@@ ic prison scenes of rape and torture .
stone admitted , " perhaps some of the z@@ eal@@ ousness , some of the anger came from being young and trying to make the point too much , too hard . "
however , he added , " it was true that bil@@ ly ha@@ yes did get so@@ dom@@ ized in the turk@@ ish prison . he was convicted to a 30 - year prison term for an offense not worth mentioning , and he was also treated bru@@ tally in prison . so this is all based on the facts . "
stone said , " the bigger picture is that turkey is not the only country whose prison system is not properly working . america has similar problems . "
japanese economic growth may slow down next year
the japanese economy may slow down in 2005 as a stronger yen and a widening gap between the rich and the poor may destroy the harmonic atmosphere the country enjoyed in the first half of the year .
with huge corporate profits and strong consumer spending , japan has regained its confidence after 10 years of stag@@ nation , but analysts rest their hopes for sustaining the economic growth on china despite the rising political tensions between the two countries .
evidence has gradually shown that the japanese economy may suffer a temporary setback in early 2005 , especially if industrial production continues to fall while manufacturers adjust stock inventories to avoid over@@ stock .
according to the newly adopted statistical methodology , the japanese economy actually contracted slightly in the april - june quarter while it grew by just 0.1 percent in the july - september quarter , narrow@@ ly escaping a technical recession .
at present , economists are still greatly divided over the ro@@ bust@@ ness of the japanese economy .
b@@ n@@ p par@@ i@@ bas researchers anticipated a 2.3 percent growth in real terms in the current fiscal year that ends in march of next year and the next fiscal year .
they called 2005 the " year of recovery " based on the reasons that the us economy has remained stable on the recovery track and japanese consumer spending is picking up the slack for slower exports .
a more pessimistic note is that u@@ f@@ j institute economists predicted a mere 1.8 percent economic growth in this fiscal year and a lower 0.6 percent in the following year .
they pointed out the " l@@ ur@@ king risk , " meaning corporate profits have not led to higher personal gains .
french foreign minister : middle east peace progress to test france - us relations
after meeting with us secretary of state pow@@ ell , french foreign minister bar@@ n@@ ier stated that the resumption of the middle east peace talks will be a " test " for their trans - at@@ lan@@ tic ties .
france had called for a quick convening of an international meeting to move forward the israel - palest@@ ine peace process after the death of palestinian leader ar@@ afat but there was no sign that an agreement had been reached after the meeting of bar@@ n@@ ier and pow@@ ell .
bar@@ n@@ ier flew from paris to washington for a lightning round of talks with pow@@ ell and his designated successor rice , the national security advisor , then headed toward brussels for a european union summit .
both paris and washington agreed to repair the strained relations brought about by the us invasion of iraq last year but differences are still obvious in resolving the middle east impasse .
after a short meeting with pow@@ ell at the state department , bar@@ n@@ ier stated , " we want to improve the future relations between the french and americ@@ ans and euro@@ pe@@ ans and americ@@ ans . "
he said , " i think the test at the heart of this relationship is our ability to launch the peace process between palest@@ inians and isra@@ elis . "
earlier this week , bar@@ n@@ ier called for the convening of an early international middle east conference in order to take advantage of what he called the " window of opportunity " presented after ar@@ afat 's death last month .
however , pow@@ ell remained non - committal .
he said that the two discussed the british plan of a meeting with palestinian participants but had not mentioned whether a broader international meeting would be convened .
us officials have made known that their most important task is to promote peace in israel and palest@@ ine , and to ensure the success of the palestinian election held next month .
this election will produce a leader who can control the isl@@ amic militants and resume the israel - palest@@ ine talks .

ji@@ ji press reported that during his meeting with south korean foreign minister ban ki - moon in the southern city of i@@ bu@@ su@@ ki of k@@ ago@@ shima prefecture , mach@@ im@@ ura indicated that since tokyo and se@@ oul both hoped to sign a f@@ ta agreement by the end of 2005 , the two parties should resume talks as soon as possible .
before mach@@ im@@ ura 's talks with ban ki - moon , japanese prime minister ko@@ izumi jun@@ ichiro and south korean president ro@@ h mo@@ o - hy@@ un held a summit on the 17 th in which ro@@ h mo@@ o - hy@@ un urged tokyo authorities to be cautious in imposing economic sanctions on north korea .
north korea had kidnapped several japanese nationals during the cold war and prime minister ko@@ izumi is under tremendous public pressure to punish north korea .
the families of the kidnapped victims were furious after japanese researchers concluded that the remains that py@@ ong@@ yang provided to prove the death of two hostages did not belong to the victims .
apart from the kidnapping issue , ko@@ izumi and ro@@ h mo@@ o - hy@@ un both agreed that the six - nation talks that aim at checking north korean nuclear weapons expansion should recomm@@ ence as soon as possible .
since the stand@@ off sparked by north korea 's secret nuclear weapons program in october 2002 , no concrete results have been achieved in the first three rounds of the six - nation talks .
north korea later boy@@ cot@@ ted the fourth round of the six - nation talks scheduled to be held this september .
the six nations that take part in the talks are south korea , north korea , the united states , china , japan , and russia , respectively .
thai premier th@@ aksin still expects to win february election
thai premier th@@ aksin is confident of winning his second four - year term when entering 2005 . however , his reputation was tarn@@ ished for not being able to suppress the bloody u@@ prising of the separatist insurg@@ ents .
a thai national election is scheduled to be held on february 6 , 2005 . th@@ aksin and his political rivals are actively preparing for the election . most analysts expected him to win despite the serious violent clashes and the bird flu in the south .
twelve people in thailand have died from bird flu this year . bird flu swept through most of the asian regions but was particularly serious in thailand . the thai government once admitted that it had " erred " in handling the epidemic .
however , this health problem is unlikely to de@@ pose th@@ aksin 's re@@ election . on the other hand , many people only asked how big a landslide his victory will be and what significance his victory will have on the muslim insur@@ gency in the southern provinces .
k@@ rais@@ ak , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , told af@@ p , " the phenomenon is that no matter how one looks at th@@ aksin , he has managed to capture a vast support from the public for the time being . "
he said , " but things will start to dis@@ integrate next year , if you look at the accumulation of wealth ( by his family and associates ) , the social inj@@ us@@ tices and the violence . "
social inj@@ us@@ tices and violence are the causes of riots in the deep south of thailand where is@@ lam is the majority , and spor@@ adic revol@@ ts have been happening since january .
since january , muslim extremists have targeted bud@@ d@@ hists , government officials , and security troops in their shoo@@ tou@@ ts . they also carried out bombings and be@@ head@@ ings . up until now , more than 560 people have died and 100 have been reported missing .
palestinian cabinet secretary claims ar@@ afat poisoned a year ago
ab@@ del ra@@ hman , cabinet secretary of late palestinian leader ar@@ afat , revealed that ar@@ afat was poisoned when receiving a delegation of supporters at the ram@@ al@@ lah compound a year ago .
ab@@ del ra@@ hman told the al - ha@@ y@@ at newspaper , " something strange happened to ar@@ afat around a year ago . it was on september 25 , 2003 .
the president shook hands with each of the 30 - some supporters . afterwards , the president began vomiting .
it was from that moment that the president 's health started slowly deteriorating . "
ar@@ afat passed away in a french hospital of an unknown illness on november 11 .
some senior palestinian officials believed that ar@@ afat was poisoned .
nonetheless , french doctors stated that such allegations did not have any medical grounds .
two weeks before the visit of the delegation mentioned by ab@@ del ra@@ hman , the cabinet of israeli prime minister shar@@ on decided to un@@ seat ar@@ afat but did not specify by what means .

ab@@ del ra@@ hman indicated , " the last time he became ill , on october 12 , 2004 , he had the same symptoms : vomiting , loss of appetite , and all the symptoms that were similar to contracting a flu . "

pu@@ tin declares purchase of yu@@ ko 's major asset is to protect state interests
russian president pu@@ tin stated today that the state 's purchase of russian oil giant yu@@ ko 's major asset was to protect the interests of the state . it is also the first re - nation@@ alization action taken in the post - soviet era .
when discussing the state - run petroleum company ros@@ ne@@ ft 's purchase of yu@@ ko 's subsidiary company , yu@@ g@@ ans@@ kne@@ f@@ te@@ ga@@ z , at the end - of - the - year press conference in the k@@ rem@@ lin , pu@@ tin stated , " today the state , using absolutely legal market mechanisms , is protecting its interests .

ros@@ ne@@ ft issued an unexpected announcement a little before midnight last night - that it has acquired 100 percent of the shares of the previously unknown bai@@ k@@ al finance group .
this acquisition gives the k@@ rem@@ lin solid control over the energy industry , which is vital to russia .

bai@@ k@@ al finance group won control of yu@@ g@@ ans@@ kne@@ f@@ te@@ ga@@ z earlier with a bid of u@@ .@@ s . $ 9.@@ 35 billion .

un : relief supplies w@@ o n 't reach ace@@ h victims for weeks
the united nations said today that the urgently needed aid will take " weeks " to deliver to tsunami victims in isolated regions of ace@@ h , indonesia .
u@@ .@@ s . navy helicopters arrived at ace@@ h 's capital of b@@ anda ace@@ h today . more and more field hospitals are operating inside the city while large amounts of relief supplies are gradually arriving at the airport .

he said , " it 's a concern and we are desperately doing what we can to find ways of establishing distribution systems in b@@ anda ace@@ h . "
the united nations and other relief organizations have warned that if victims in indonesian su@@ mat@@ ra regions do not have clean drinking water , food , and medical treatment immediately , they will die in a few days .
when asked if the delay in delivery was literally sentencing the tsunami victims to death , el@@ m@@ qu@@ ist replied , " i hope not . i hope that people are finding ways to get food and water , but obviously it 's not a situation we are happy about . "

japan out@@ pledges nations with 500 million u@@ .@@ s . dollars
japan promised today to provide u@@ .@@ s . $ 500 million to aid countries affected by the indian ocean tsunami . while countries are competing to assist victims of the world 's worst disaster , japan 's pledge has topped the donor 's list of all nations and increased the total international relief and reconstruction fund raised so far to u@@ .@@ s . $ 1.6 billion .
japanese prime minister ko@@ izumi jun@@ ichiro issued a statement saying that as asia 's largest economy , japan would consider providing more assistance , including money and technology .
he said , " japan will provide assistance to the maximum extent possible in three ways : financial resources , knowledge and technology , and human resources . "
he stated , " for the time being , japan will extend to affected countries and international organizations concerned up to u@@ .@@ s . $ 500 million of grant money as emergency assistance to cope with the damage . "
ko@@ izumi added that he would participate in the world leaders meeting held in jakarta on the 6 th to discuss issues on assisting tsunami - hit countries .
after u@@ .@@ s . president bush was accused of being slow in re@@ acting to this human catastrophe , the u@@ .@@ s . government had raised the relief amount it promised ten - fold to u@@ .@@ s . $ 350 million yesterday .
china , considered to be more and more inclined to challenge japan 's influence in asia , also promised to provide u@@ .@@ s . $ 6@@ 0.5 million assistance , a huge amount for a developing country .

the world health organization ( who ) said today that 50 relief organizations have arrived in ace@@ h to provide medical aid to survivors of the tsunami .
p@@ eter@@ sen , the who 's indonesian representative , said that the who was trying to coordinate all the organizations and had a meeting with them in the afternoon .
p@@ eter@@ sen claimed that the coordination was extremely difficult since many organizations have gone directly to ace@@ h to provide relief efforts .
in a telephone interview from jakarta , p@@ eter@@ sen said , " we are trying to sort it out , everyone has just come in , however , everyone has shown a great willingness to cooperate . "
p@@ eter@@ sen stressed that the main concern of the who was to prevent the outbreak of epidemics such as cholera and diarrhea , which can cause tens of thousands of deaths .
p@@ eter@@ sen said , " we are very worried since we have a large number of people displaced who do n 't have sufficient clean water or adequate food supplies .
so we have a situation that is very ripe for epidemic outbreaks . "
nonetheless , p@@ eter@@ sen emphasized that there had not been any sign of such disease yet .
the indonesian health ministry said that the death toll of the tsunami in su@@ mat@@ ra may reach 100,000 people , with most of them in ace@@ h .

pow@@ ell predicts shi@@ ites to win in ira@@ qi election
u@@ .@@ s . secretary of state pow@@ ell predicted today that the shi@@ ites will win in the upcoming ira@@ qi election . however , he believed that since the ira@@ qi and ir@@ anian shi@@ ites were on bad terms with each other before , it should not be a concern that the shi@@ ites ' victory may increase ir@@ anian influence in iraq .
more and more evidence has shown that sun@@ ni musli@@ ms will either boycott the january 31 election or will be prevented from participating in the election by the ira@@ qi authorities for spreading insur@@ gency .
pow@@ ell said on n@@ b@@ c 's meet the press show , " the new government that comes into place in bag@@ hdad , the transitional national assembly , will be majority shi@@ ite .
that 's the majority of the population . "
shi@@ ite musli@@ ms made up more than 60 percent of the ira@@ qi population ; most of them reside in southern and central iraq .
the sun@@ nis , who constitute 20 percent of the population , live in the central and western provinces .
former foreign minister p@@ ach@@ achi , who is the current leader of the ira@@ qi independent democrats dominated by the sun@@ nis , called for the postponement of the election today but pow@@ ell claimed that the ira@@ qi election will be held as scheduled .
pow@@ ell added that the control of the future ira@@ qi government by the shi@@ ites does not mean that iran will have control of iraq 's political situation .
he said , " my sense right now is that , even though there may be ir@@ anian influence - and ir@@ an@@ ians will try to influence the ira@@ qi political situation , of course - there is a sufficient difference and past serious dis@@ agreements and conflicts between ir@@ anian and ira@@ qi shi@@ ites . "
international aid p@@ ours in ; tsunami victims racing against time
overseas rescue troops are air@@ dropping food and building clean water supply systems in tsunami - hit disaster areas in asia in order to help several million homeless and star@@ ving victims .
figures showed that the death toll has reached almost 150,000 .
relief supplies continue to pour in from governments while u@@ .@@ s . president bush appointed his father , bush senior , and former president clinton to be in charge of raising private aid .
the delegation headed by u@@ .@@ s . secretary of state pow@@ ell arrived in thailand last night to show u@@ .@@ s . concern and assess the relief work progress before the crisis summit in the indonesian capital of jakarta on the 6 th .
accompanying pow@@ ell were je@@ b bush , younger brother of president bush and governor of fl@@ or@@ ida ; and nat@@ si@@ os , the chief of the u@@ .@@ s . agency for international development .
pow@@ ell will lead the delegation to tour thailand , indonesia , and s@@ ri lan@@ ka to inspect the disaster situation before attending the summit on the 6 th .
pow@@ ell stated that the objective of his tour was to assess the disaster situation " and see what else we might need to do " but he will not make any immediate promise to increase the donations beyond the u@@ .@@ s . $ 350 million already pledged .
after the disaster , talks of giving up the search for thousands of visitors who remain missing , most of them foreign tourists , have surfaced .
however , thai prime minister th@@ aksin vowed to continue the search in this country .
th@@ aksin told reporters at p@@ hu@@ ket island , " foreign experts have told me that they ( the missing ) may have been buried in mud in mang@@ rove forests . we will continue to use our best efforts , and we will not stop searching . "
the largest international rescue effort in history continues .
the navy helicopters dispatched from the us@@ s " abra@@ ham lin@@ coln " were carrying out their second day of duties to air@@ drop relief materials and transport survivors in ace@@ h indonesia .
rear adm@@ ir@@ al crow@@ der , commander of the lin@@ coln , said 50,000 pounds of food and water had been delivered to the disaster areas , and the mission was " going great . "
political tu@@ g - of - war behind tsunami relief efforts
while asia 's tsunami relief supplies pour into the disaster areas , a less honorable activity is secretly underway as governments fight over who should give and who should receive , and who should lead the largest relief operation in modern times .
the disaster that caused almost 150,000 deaths has revived old battles , including the dis@@ agreements between the united states , the united nations , and europe , and the struggle for leadership in asia .
however , relief experts still hold cautious hope that the global nature of this disaster that hit so many countries may set a precedent : governments honor their promises to help .
jum@@ a , professor of international development at har@@ v@@ ard 's jo@@ hn f . ken@@ nedy school of government said , " there has never been an aid pledge for which governments have come through 100 percent and on time . "
donations pledged by governments have reached u@@ .@@ s . $ 2 billion . important international figures including un secretary general ann@@ an and u@@ .@@ s . secretary of state pow@@ ell , as well as leaders of australia , china , and japan , will hold a crisis summit with rich political over@@ tones in jakarta on the 6 th .
after allegations of a slow response and the open criticism by top un relief official eg@@ eland of rich countries for being ' st@@ ing@@ y , ' u@@ .@@ s . president bush has increased u@@ .@@ s . aid almost ten - fold to u@@ .@@ s . $ 350 million .
in asia , the tsunami disaster has led to a covert race for regional influence . the increasingly confident china has pledged u@@ .@@ s . $ 6@@ 0.5 million , a huge sum for a developing nation .
japan , which has cut its foreign aid budget in six consecutive years , has also shattered talk of its declining national power by promising to provide at least u@@ .@@ s . $ 500 million , an amount that d@@ war@@ f@@ s all the other nations .
world leaders to tour s@@ ri lan@@ kan disaster areas
s@@ ri lan@@ kan officials stated that world leaders including un secretary general ann@@ an and u@@ .@@ s . secretary of state pow@@ ell have arrived in s@@ ri lan@@ ka successively to personally examine the tsunami disaster situation that claimed 30,@@ 600 lives in the country at the end of last month .
they said that pow@@ ell had arrived , while south korean prime minister lee ha@@ e - chan was scheduled to arrive later that afternoon .
a press release issued by the u@@ .@@ s . embassy said that pow@@ ell will visit some of the hardest - hit areas by the tsunami disaster of december 26 , including the southern region of gal@@ le , where u@@ .@@ s . marines are stationed for relief operations .

u@@ .@@ s . november trade deficit hits record high of $ 60 billion
figures announced by the u@@ .@@ s . department of commerce showed that u@@ .@@ s . exports shrunk 2.3 percent last november , sending the trade deficit to a record high of u@@ .@@ s . $ 6@@ 0.3 billion .
u@@ .@@ s . exports fell to a five - month low of u@@ .@@ s . $ 9@@ 5.6 billion . meanwhile , as u@@ .@@ s . imported oil rose to u@@ .@@ s . $ 14.@@ 2 billion , an increase of over u@@ .@@ s . $ 2 billion or 1.3 percent , imports thus increased by 1.3 percent , reaching an all - time high of u@@ .@@ s . $ 15@@ 5.8 billion .
the trade deficit increased by 7.7 percent from last october 's revised u@@ .@@ s . $ 56 billion and a huge 5@@ 0.8 percent increase from u@@ .@@ s . $ 40 billion in november the year before .
according to a survey conducted by c@@ bs market@@ watch , wall street economists expected the trade deficit on goods and services would drop to around u@@ .@@ s . $ 5@@ 3.3 billion .
despite a weak u@@ .@@ s . dollar that makes goods produced in the u@@ .@@ s . cheaper at home and abroad , the u@@ .@@ s . trade deficit continues to expand .
the report released by the commerce department today will add pressure on the dollar and revive appeals for washington to take action in u@@ .@@ s . energy independence and the resolution of the u@@ .@@ s . - china trade imbalance .
a drop in u@@ .@@ s . exports last november was caused by a reduction of u@@ .@@ s . $ 1.4 billion in capital goods , including u@@ .@@ s . $ 325 million in aircraft and aircraft engines .
industrial materials exports , mostly energy , fell by u@@ .@@ s . $ 800 million .
automobile , consumer goods , and food exports also fell .
japanese defense agency director - general : remembers militar@@ ist past , respects neighboring countries ' dignity
japanese defense agency director - general on@@ o yo@@ sh@@ in@@ ori stated today that while japan adopts a higher international profile , it will not forget its militar@@ ist past and will remember the " dignity " of neighboring asian countries .
when asked about the un@@ eas@@ iness caused by japan 's deployment of the self - defense forces to south asian tsunami disaster areas , on@@ o said , " while we get along with southeast asian nations , we should never forget the past . "
he told reporters , " we must build relations with friendly countries so that we can tell them that we have good intentions .
we should pay full respect to the dignity of other countries while looking at the past as it was . "
on@@ o specifically mentioned that this year marked the 60 th anniversary of the end of the second world war . he said , " we want to be re@@ born and cooperate for the sake of a new era . "
on@@ o just finished his visit to several south asian tsunami - rav@@ aged countries . he said that he felt the " dignity " of an independent nation when the indonesian leader told him that the japanese self - defense forces should finish their rescue mission no later than the end of march .
the united nations has voiced its concern over the deadline imposed by the indonesian government on foreign troops .
foreign troops received broad credit for rescuing tsunami survivors in remote areas .
close to 1,000 japanese self - defense personnel are heading toward countries hit by the tsunami of december 26 . over 16@@ 3,000 people died in this natural disaster .
this is the biggest deployment of the japanese self - defense forces since the end of the second world war .
the post - war constitution in japan dominated by the united states prohibits the use of force by the self - defense forces .
political intervention in nh@@ k program . japanese media touch off debates
according to rumors , nh@@ k t@@ oned down a program about women who were forced by the japanese army to become prostitutes during the second world war that aired a few years ago , due to pressure from political figures . japanese liberal media thus launched a dispute with their conservative colleagues on the issue .
according to sources , nh@@ k cut the majority of the interview contents in the program after discussing it with top politicians . most of the interviewees were critics of japanese wartime behavior and victims who were forced to become prostitutes . nh@@ k 's action had solicited criticism from the liberal media .
nonetheless , conservative newspapers defended nh@@ k 's decision to revise the contents of the program , stating that the company 's senior officials had the responsibility to ensure the fairness and objectivity of the program 's contents .
the dispute , which focused on a program aired in 2001 about a mock trial of the crime committed by the japanese army of forcing women to become prostitutes during the war , erupted last week .
the trial was held by a japanese women 's rights group in december 2000 . the verdict found late emperor hi@@ ro@@ hi@@ to guilty of allowing the japanese army to comm@@ an@@ deer prostitutes during the japanese occupation of asian countries .
historians said that at least 200,000 young women were forced to become prostitutes at frontline japanese bro@@ th@@ els during the war . most of them came from korea , but there were also women from taiwan , china , the philipp@@ ines , and indonesia .
the program 's producer , n@@ ag@@ ai sat@@ or@@ u , blew the whist@@ le in a t@@ ear@@ ful press conference on the 13 th , saying that before the program was aired , nh@@ k top officials had met with senators a@@ be and n@@ ak@@ ag@@ awa of the ruling liberal democratic party , who showed concern over the program contents .
according to n@@ ag@@ ai , nh@@ k top officials then re - edited the program and wat@@ ered down its contents .
he said , " nh@@ k b@@ owed to political pressures . "
a@@ be and n@@ ak@@ ag@@ awa admitted that they had met with nh@@ k personnel and told them that they had to be " fair " , but strongly denied that they had exerted pressure on the company .
euro@@ zone indicators show core inflation under control
economists said today that euro@@ zone indicators to be released this week would show that core inflation remains under control .
meanwhile , both euro@@ zone industrial output and french consumer spending are expected to fall .
it is expected that the european union 's statistics service will confirm the inflation rate is up a little from 2.2 percent in november to 2.3 percent in december when it releases inflation figures on the 20 th .
but the increase is largely a reflection of tobacco tax increases , while the core inflation rate is expected to remain at 1.9 percent .
core inflation figures and consumer price index figures will be released together .
economists pointed out that core inflation , which ex@@ cludes food , energy , tobacco , and alcohol prices , has remained at 1.6 to 2.0 percent for the past two years .
european central bank president tr@@ ich@@ et stated on the 13 th that short - term price pressures have dropped recently .
although inflation will remain above 2 percent in the next few months , a decrease is expected by the end of the year .
meanwhile , another economist stated that a decrease in euro@@ zone november industrial output to be released on the 18 th is expected due to a slowdown in growth in germany .
german industrial output dropped 1.7 percent in november while economists surveyed by af@@ p 's financial news subsidiary expected that euro@@ zone output would decrease by 0.4 percent in november after a drop of 0.5 percent in october .
sch@@ mi@@ eding of the bank of america said that euro@@ zone output may rebound in december .
bureaucracy blows second strike to tsunami victims
three weeks after the assault of the worst tsunami in history , survivors are fighting per@@ n@@ icious habits of red tape and politic@@ king . meanwhile , the world focus has shifted elsewhere .
thousands of decom@@ posed bodies are continuously being unearthed from the rubble , bringing the death toll of the december 26 tsunami to over 16@@ 8,000 people . at the same time , the approaching ira@@ qi election and president bush 's inauguration have replaced the tsunami as the headlines of the global media .
indonesia originally ordered foreign troops who engaged in humanitarian missions to withdraw within three months but later resc@@ in@@ ded this demand .
in thailand , the leaders of canada , sweden , norway , and finland are meeting to discuss the reconstruction and body - identification work .
nonetheless , the survivors are facing new challenges such as the delay in the distribution of relief materials that poured in from around the world , caused by the deep - rooted bureaucracy in indonesia .
bus@@ ri@@ adi , a fisherman from a small village near b@@ anda ace@@ h , the capital of ace@@ h on su@@ mat@@ ra island in indonesia , said , " we are like people who do not exist . we have been hit hard by the disaster , lost everything , and are fam@@ ished . "
he stated , " where is the food , the clothes , and other relief we see on television flowing into ace@@ h ? "
like thousands of other victims , bus@@ ri@@ adi lost his identification card and other official documents , thus turning his efforts in getting aid into a nightmare .
despite his pleading with officials and bustling about everyday going through the formalities , the result is the same : no aid .
zeng qing@@ hong believed to have visited zhao zi@@ yang at his death bed
the hong kong - based information center for human rights in china stated that zeng qing@@ hong , vice president of the people 's republic of china , visited the de@@ posed former party secretary general of the chinese communist party , zhao zi@@ yang , at the hospital before he passed away this morning .
the information center said that according to zhao 's family , zen qing@@ hong visited zhao at a beijing hospital at 6 a.m. today . zhao passed away about an hour later , at the age of 85 .
zhao zi@@ yang was once the party secretary general of the chinese communist party and the prime minister . he was ou@@ sted in 1989 for his opposition to the suppression by force of the democratic movement in tian@@ anmen square . he was later held under house arrest and was considered an un@@ welcome figure by the government .
the information center said that according to zhao 's family , the current premier , wen ji@@ abao , who was once under zhao , did not visit him when he was termin@@ ally ill .
nonetheless , before zhao zi@@ yang fell into a coma on the 14 th , tian ji@@ yun , a retired central committee member who was once zhao 's assistance , went to visit him .
the information center for human rights in china has kept contact with zhao 's family and has been releasing timely and accurate information on zhao zi@@ yang 's situation for years .
the information center indicated that approximately 20 retired key members of the party , the government , and the army planned to issue an open letter to the chinese communist party calling for the re@@ evaluation of zhao zi@@ yang 's contributions and asking to hold a public memorial service for him .
the center added that zhao 's family would not be allowed to hold or make arrangements for the funeral ; all final decisions on related arrangements will be made by the party .
liang bai@@ qi , zhao zi@@ yang 's wife , is 86 years old .
the information center said that she had not been told of her husband 's death until this evening due to the poor condition of her health .
democratization urged in china after zhao zi@@ yang 's death
after former chinese communist party leader zhao zi@@ yang died of an illness today , people around the world spoke highly of him while japanese prime minister ko@@ izumi jun@@ ichiro , the taiwan government , and overseas chinese democratic figures all called on beijing to implement zhao zi@@ yang 's democratic reform ideas .
zhao zi@@ yang was dismissed from office in 1989 for opposing the military suppression of the tian@@ anmen square democratic movement and had spent the rest of his life under house arrest . he passed away in a beijing hospital this morning at the age of 85 .
according to ji@@ ji news services , japanese prime minister ko@@ izumi said , " i want them ( china ) to make efforts at democratization " while mourning zhao zi@@ yang 's death .
taiwan also urged china to implement democratic and political reforms after the death of zhao zi@@ yang .
overseas chinese democratic figures praised zhao zi@@ yang as " one of china 's greatest reform@@ ers " who sacrificed his own political career to oppose the bloody crackdown on the democratic movement in tian@@ anmen square .
lian sh@@ eng@@ de , a former student movement leader and the president of the new york - based free china movement , said , " during his 15 years under house arrest , he publicly advocated the need for political reforms and progress toward the rule of law and democracy .
zhao zi@@ yang will be fon@@ dly remembered as a true democr@@ at and a person of principle . "
some democratic figures asked the chinese government to hold a public funeral for zhao zi@@ yang and to provide fair assessments of his achievements .
however , they admitted that zhao zi@@ yang would not receive such courteous treatment , since the chinese government fears that people who are dissatisfied with communist rule will use this opportunity to stir up riots .
the 1989 student movement was provoked by the death of reform@@ ist leader hu ya@@ ob@@ ang .
xinhua news agency published a brief report today saying that comrade zhao zi@@ yang died of an illness in a beijing hospital . this was the only official statement on the matter .

shanghai electric group is the largest power plant equipment - manufacturing base in china .
with the rapid growth in the demand for power - generating equipment in china in recent years , power generator manufacturers across the country have entered a phase marked by huge growth and major development .
shanghai electric group consolidated the favorable resources of power plant equipment including steam tur@@ bines and power plant boilers . after undertaking the production of four million - kilow@@ att grade ther@@ mo - power generating units , it has also acquired production orders for nine heavy - duty fuel - powered electric generating units and three waste heat boilers through a combined bidding .
meanwhile , through an integrated operation , it has further enhanced its business management , technology development , and production efficiency .
at present , shanghai electric group holds 40 percent of the market share for the chinese power plant equipment industry and is continuously expanding its overseas markets in the middle east , southeast asia , and south america .

( hong kong , mac@@ au , taiwan ) hong kong observ@@ atory to provide new services for w@@ mo
xinhua news agency , hong kong , december 12 - the hong kong observ@@ atory will launch two new services for the " world weather information service " and " severe weather information center " websites hosted by the world meteorological organization , starting december 2 .
a spokesman for the observ@@ atory said that the two new services are to add a global official weather observation of clou@@ din@@ ess and rain to the " world weather information service " website and a rec@@ ap function to display the tropical cyclone paths for the past seven days on the " severe weather information center " website .
these two programs are another new service that the hong kong observ@@ atory is offering after it started providing the " severe weather information center " with official observation information of heavy rain ( including snow ) in areas around the world earlier this year .
according to information , the " world weather information service " website has been providing official weather forecasts and monthly mean cli@@ mat@@ ological information for the world 's major cities .
the new service , for the first time , provides global official weather observations with the clou@@ din@@ ess and rain distribution map as its first project introduced .
the weather observation information on the new web page has a wide coverage and a high density , with eight scheduled updates per day .
the new product of the " severe weather information center " website is to provide a rec@@ ap function for displaying tropical cyclone paths .
the previous design was that once the tropical cyclone dissip@@ ated , information including the location of the tropical cyclone would no longer be saved on the website .
however , the public often still wants to obtain related information about the tropical cyclone a few days after it makes land@@ fall .
as a result , the new product will store information on the intensi@@ ties , locations , and paths of tropical cycl@@ ones that have happened in the past seven days so the public and the media can still obtain desired information several days after the tropical cyclone has landed and dissip@@ ated .

the ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate was once believed to be the only arti@@ fact discovered from the first temple , during king sol@@ om@@ on 's era .
sn@@ y@@ der stated in a declaration that the israeli authorities had conducted a detailed examination on the thum@@ b - sized ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate .
experts discovered that the relic should belong to the bronze age and is considerably older than the first je@@ wish temple 's era .
a line inscribed in he@@ brew let@@ tering on the ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate reads , " belonging to the temple of the lord ( y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ) , holy to the priests . "
the inscription was verified to be added afterwards .
the israel museum spent u@@ .@@ s . $ 5@@ 50,000 to buy this ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate from an anonymous collector in the 1980 s of last century .
archae@@ ologists and anti@@ quity experts once believed that it was a treasure mounted on the top of a priest 's scep@@ ter in the first temple , and the only relic left from that time .
sn@@ y@@ der claimed that before they bought the ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate , israeli archae@@ ologist na@@ hman av@@ ig@@ ad and other experts had authenticated the relic .
according to ha@@ aret@@ z daily , av@@ ig@@ ad only used a magn@@ ifying glass to do a cur@@ sory check on the relic at that time .
av@@ ig@@ ad personally denied such allegations .
in recent months , israeli police have discovered three major anti@@ quity forgery cases successively and have sub@@ po@@ en@@ a@@ ed several hundred people .
during their investigation , the police and the anti@@ quities authority discovered seren@@ di@@ pit@@ ously that the ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate is a forgery .
the police will file charges against some of the people involved in the case next week .
in the 10 th century b@@ .@@ c . , the je@@ wish king sol@@ om@@ on built the first temple at present - day temple mount to store holy items including the ark of the covenant and no@@ ah 's ark , which were later destroyed .
shenzhen en@@ forces " middle - water " usage in buildings and small districts
xinhua news agency , guangzhou , december 26 - shenzhen will enforce " middle - water " usage in some larger - scale buildings and small districts as a major measure in establishing " water - saving style " cities . at present , relevant specifications and regulations for the middle - water plan are being drawn up .
middle - water mainly refers to non - drinking water from treated city and daily wastewater that has reached a certain water quality , and can be re@@ used in certain areas .
its water quality is between tap water and wastewater that goes down the drainage .
in general , it is widely used for flushing toilets , wat@@ ering gardens and farm@@ lands , cleaning roads , washing cars , and supplement@@ ing the water in city foun@@ tains and cooling facilities .
a study by shenzhen water works showed that in the mid 1990 s of the 20 th century , more than 70 buildings in shenzhen were equipped with the " middle - water " - recycling system . however , the cost of recycling for " middle - water " was too high due to technological , design , and management factors , thus forcing the construction unit to stop using it .
only r@@ m@@ b 300,000 to 400,000 yuan of extra investment will be needed to install the " middle - water " - treatment system in order for these pipelines to perform their functions properly .
if the more than 70 existing sets of " middle - water " pipelines are being used , according to the present daily usage of 500 tons of " middle - water " in small districts , it will save 35,000 tons of tap water for shenzhen per day .
according to information , the shenzhen " middle - water " - recycling project will start with the re@@ modeling of the more than 70 existing buildings that have the " middle - water " - recycling system . after summar@@ izing the experience , the project will be further expanded .
meanwhile , shenzhen water works will draw up specifications for the " middle - water " - plan with urban planning and development departments as soon as possible and will enforce " middle - water " usage in some larger - scale buildings .
the treated " middle - water " will first be used in wat@@ ering the trees in and around the city .
