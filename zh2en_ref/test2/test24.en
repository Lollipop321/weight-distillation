ba@@ h@@ rain@@ i princess married us soldier , sensational marriage breaks up in five years
ba@@ h@@ rain@@ i princess mer@@ i@@ am al - k@@ hal@@ if@@ a 's marriage with the humble us marine jo@@ hn@@ son was once a widely hailed story by us television channels . however , their thorny marriage has now ended in the desert gambling town of las v@@ eg@@ as after lasting for just five years .
the fairy - tale marriage between mer@@ i@@ am , a member of the gulf state of ba@@ h@@ rain 's royal family , and us marine jo@@ hn@@ son , who devoted himself to this banned love affair , ris@@ king his military career , became the subject of a television movie .
but the las v@@ eg@@ as review - journal reported that merely five years had passed before the couple confronted each other in court when mer@@ i@@ am filed for divorce in the gambling town where procedures for marriages are quick and for dis@@ solutions are quicker .
the two met in 1999 when jo@@ hn@@ son was a career army man stationed in ba@@ h@@ rain .
but his life changed dramatically when he met the young teenage princess and the pair fell in love .
the young couple 's union was forbidden by the royal family , so jo@@ hn@@ son disguised mer@@ i@@ am in a fl@@ annel shirt and a baseball cap and forged her military identification papers , taking her out of her home country to the us .
after a bitter immigration lawsuit against us authorities , the couple married at the cand@@ l@@ elight wedding cha@@ pel on the las v@@ eg@@ as strip famed for its magnific@@ ence when jo@@ hn@@ son was 23 and the bride was only 19 .
but jo@@ hn@@ son said the wealth of temp@@ tations in the " sin city " of las v@@ eg@@ as , ongoing tensions with mer@@ i@@ am 's wealthy and powerful family , and rumors of a plot to assass@@ inate him had finally contributed to the break@@ up of the thorny marriage .
jo@@ hn@@ son said he made a living parking cars for hotel and casino guests , while mer@@ i@@ am increasingly indul@@ ged in the night@@ life of the gambling town , frequ@@ enting night clubs late at night and ignoring him as her husband .
mer@@ i@@ am abandoned her husband a year ago .
" she has sunk to the bottom , " jo@@ hn@@ son said .
euro@@ zone indicators this week will suggest weak european economy to continue
economists said euro@@ zone economic indicators to be released this week would show further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing economic output , while british data was expected to show increased industrial activity .
they said economic output data from the largest euro@@ zone countries would continue to indicate great volatility each month , but the long - term trend of economic output would suggest slowing economic growth .
the most crucial figure of the week will be from germany , where the z@@ ew institute 's economic expectations indicator , which is closely monitored by the market , is due on the 7 th and will provide the first evidence of economic confidence in europe for december .
the z@@ ew index sl@@ um@@ ped to 13.@@ 9 in november from 3@@ 1.3 in the previous month .
the euro 's significant appreciation would continue to weigh on economic confidence in the recent surveys , so there 's no reason to expect the indicator to rebound , economists said .
" considering that the main factors driving down economic confidence , including the euro 's appreciation , uncertainty in the global economy , and a worsening unemployment rate in the german job market have been a drag on future growth expectations during the december survey , a strong rebound in the index is unlikely , " economists at b@@ n@@ p said .
according to a survey among economists conducted by af@@ x news , the af@@ p financial news services , the indicator will slip again to 11.@@ 0 in december from 13.@@ 9 in the previous month .
but tea@@ ther of the u@@ bs investment bank said germany 's z@@ ew economic expectations indicator could even drop to zero in december .
" future expectations of german economic activity , as reflected in the z@@ ew survey among analysts and financial market participants , will continue to fall in our view , " tea@@ ther said .
east - west tension over ukraine crisis to be discussed by the os@@ ce
repeated accusations by russia of western intervention in eastern european affairs have increasingly been a focus because of the political crisis in ukraine , and the issue is set to dominate the annual ministerial meeting of the organization for security and cooperation opening in europe tomorrow .
russia has been unhappy for a long time with the gradual extension of western influence into corners of europe that russia previously considered its back@@ yard , such as the bal@@ tic states , ge@@ or@@ gia , and central asia , and so recent events in ukraine could be an important topic at the two - day os@@ ce meeting in the bulgar@@ ian capital so@@ fia .
the ukrainian supreme court made its dramatic decision , ordering another poll of the second - round run@@ off for the recent presidential election . even before that , the european union had called on os@@ ce member states to get ready for its observers to " act with the greatest speed and efficiency . "
a european source said the number of observers sent by the os@@ ce could increase from the original 600 to 1000 in ukraine 's new run@@ off vote , scheduled for december 26 .
us secretary of state pow@@ ell will attend the os@@ ce annual meeting , which will be perhaps his last foreign visit before stepping down .
the meeting will also be attended by russian foreign minister lav@@ rov , french foreign minister bar@@ n@@ ier , british foreign minister straw , and their german counterpart f@@ ischer .
the os@@ ce consists of 55 member states from north america , europe , and asia and will mark its 30 th anniversary next year .
the organization , established at a meeting in hel@@ sinki , contributed to ending the cold war .
bush 's major test : intelligence reform bill faces congress vote this week
the intelligence reform bill that the us congress will try its best to pass this week is an ambitious plan by re@@ public@@ an president bush to promote his second term , while his support rate among the re@@ public@@ an lawmakers will be his first major test after re@@ election .
in a newspaper interview yesterday , ke@@ an , the former re@@ public@@ an governor of new j@@ er@@ sey responsible for an investigation into the september 11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington in the us , said the problem with the intelligence reform bill was that it had to go through congress , and the process alone bo@@ de ill for future bi@@ partisan cooperation and the president 's domestic agenda .
" if the president and congress ca n 't properly solve these big issues , congress will become dys@@ functional and we 'll be all in trouble , " ke@@ an said .
" we 'll then have to wait for a long time before there 's another bill with the support of the re@@ public@@ an and democratic leadership in both houses and a support rate of 80 percent in public opinion polls , " he told the new york daily news .
a number of lawmakers said yesterday that a failure of the landmark reform bill could delay the overhaul of america 's obsolete spy network operations by months or years , or even end the network altogether .
" if the bill fails to pass this week , it 'll be ab@@ orted , " har@@ man , top democratic representative in the house intelligence committee , said on c@@ nn yesterday .
congress will try again on the 6 th and 7 th to pass the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 before adjour@@ ning till early next year .
if it fails , the entire bill will become invalid and will have to wait until 2005 for congress to re@@ write it .
ukrainian opposition firmly rejects constitutional amendment that significantly weak@@ ens presidential powers
ukraine 's pro - west opposition today insisted it would not accept the constitutional reform pushed by the outgoing president ku@@ chma ahead of a repeat of the second - round presidential run@@ off .
the constitutional reform would strip a major part of the president 's existing powers .
after the supreme court annul@@ led the november 21 election citing widespread malpractices in the second - round vote and the general election commission ordered a repeat of the run@@ off on december 26 , the opposition leader y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko is again locked in a stand@@ off with ku@@ chma .
" if the constitutional amendment is passed in its current form , all the powers of the president would be transferred to the parliament . this would be unacceptable , " said y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko 's ally ti@@ mo@@ sh@@ enko .
" we want the president to be able to appoint the chief of the intelligence agency and the prosecutor - general so we can fight corruption and eliminate the group that controls ukraine 's political and business circles , " she told reporters .
ku@@ chma , who maintains close ties with russia , had pushed for the constitutional amendment before the repeat of the run@@ off due to his concern that the opposition could win the presidential election .
opposition lawmakers yesterday refused to vote on the government - proposed constitutional amendment , which caused the parliament to adjourn for ten days .
according to the constitutional amendment , the power to appoint all top posts except for the prime minister , defense minister , and foreign minister will be transferred from the president to parliament , where pro - government forces currently have a near majority .
based on what the amendment says , the president 's nominees for the prime minister , defense minister and foreign minister need to be approved by the parliament , which may also name its own candidates .
ukraine 's political crisis enters third week , opposition calls for continued struggle
ukraine heads into a third week of turmoil caused by the presidential election , amid which opposition leader y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko today called on supporters to keep up the street struggle by besieg@@ ing the presidential palace and government buildings until outgoing president ku@@ chma s@@ acks prime minister y@@ anu@@ kov@@ ich and his cabinet members and takes steps to ensure the new upcoming presidential run - off is fair .
thousands of y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko 's supporters have mass@@ ed in the capital ki@@ ev for two weeks , besieg@@ ing government buildings and camping in the main avenue specially designed by soviet experts for viewing military par@@ ades . the power of people y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko 's supporters demonstrated forced the supreme court to ann@@ ul the november 21 second - round presidential election and the general election commission to order a repeat of the run@@ off on december 26 . while parliament has already voted to sack y@@ anu@@ kov@@ ich , ku@@ chma has not signed a decree to replace the successor whom he 's been gro@@ oming .
y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko tonight told supporters who gathered at independence square in the capital city that ku@@ chma should replace his administration and reshuffle the general election commission , and that both parliament and ku@@ chma should agree to revise the election law to prevent vote ri@@ gging .
he said in a speech serving as the prelude to the december 26 run@@ off that " until these decisions are made , there can be no talk of lifting the blockade of the government buildings or the presidential palace .
for 14 days this square has demonstrated a love of ukraine and the civic awareness of millions of ukrain@@ ians who are capable of defending their choice . "
" we are experiencing a struggle between good and evil forces . the entire world is appl@@ au@@ ding our victory and the entire world is proud of ukraine , " he said .
as the opposition steps up pressure on the moscow - backed ruling authority and y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko is again locked in a stand@@ off with ku@@ chma over the constitutional reforms , polish president kw@@ asni@@ ewski , li@@ thu@@ anian president ad@@ am@@ k@@ us , and russian envoy gr@@ y@@ z@@ lo@@ v are expected to arrive in ki@@ ev on the 6 th for a fresh round of mediation .
egy@@ pt announces breakthrough in middle east peace difficulties
egy@@ pt said a new framework was expected for the middle east peace deal .
it also said it could soon return an ambassador to israel to restore full diplomatic ties after a four - year break .
quoting " high - level " egy@@ ptian sources , egy@@ pt 's state - owned news agency men@@ a said parties seeking a peace plan have gradually reached common understanding on the comprehensive reconciliation .
" an important understanding has been reached among egy@@ pt , israel , palest@@ ine and significant international groups , such as the united states and the european union , agreeing in principle to resolve the israeli - palestinian conflict in a comprehensive way , " men@@ a said .
following the death last month of palestinian strong man ar@@ afat , the international community has resumed advancement of middle east peace policies aiming to end years of bloody conflicts between israel and palest@@ ine as soon as possible .
men@@ a said officials expected that " preparations would last until july , after which political action will begin . "
then a conference would be held in washington by parties concerned with the middle east peace process , namely israel and palest@@ ine , as well as egy@@ pt , the united states , russia , and several european countries , men@@ a said .
expected topics include " bilateral ceasefire ; " the palestinian authority would " put a stop to anti - israeli attacks and strengthen its control in the ga@@ za strip and the west bank . "
in this regard , men@@ a said , israeli prime minister shar@@ on promised " to halt israeli military operations against the palest@@ inians as long as the palestinian authority respects the ceasefire accord and keeps its land under control . "
over one billion children around the world tor@@ tured by war , poverty , and aids
more than one billion children , half of the world 's population of children , suffer from the s@@ cour@@ ge of poverty , war and rampant aids , said an annual report released today by the united nations children 's fund ( un@@ ic@@ ef ) .
the rights of children to a healthy and secure growing environment , as laid out in the 1989 convention on the rights of the child , are often jeopardized , due in part to the failure of governments to implement human rights and economic reforms , un@@ ic@@ ef said .
" when half of the world 's children are growing up in a hungry and unhealthy environment , when schools become targets of attacks and whole villages are destroyed by aids , we can no longer deliver on our promise to children , " un@@ ic@@ ef executive director ms . b@@ ell@@ amy said while releasing the annual report in london .
" too many governments are making deliberate decisions that actually hurt children , " b@@ ell@@ amy said .
statistics compiled through the joint efforts of researchers from un@@ ic@@ ef , britain 's london school of economics and bri@@ st@@ ol university have revealed a terrible scenario of children at risk in much of the world .
researchers found that some 640 million children around the world lack adequate shelter , 400 million children have no access to safe drinking water , 270 million children have no access to health care services , and 140 million children ( mostly girls ) have never been to school .
more seriously , at last 700 million children suffer from various forms of " severe deprivation , " which includes lacking access to information and not being able to use public sanitary facilities , researchers said .
the 10 th annual report released by un@@ ic@@ ef today said war and aids had destroyed networks that normally protected children , and children had at times become direct victims of war and aids .
china pushes for lifting arms ban , but eu resists
the european union today re@@ buff@@ ed pressure from china 's premier wen ji@@ abao for a quick end to the arms embargo on china , but said it would work towards lifting the 15 - year - old embargo .
the eu 's rotating president , the nether@@ lands , made the above comments after a china - eu summit .
the nether@@ lands said there was no need to speculate on how the eu would end the embargo .
the eu imposed the arms embargo on beijing after the 1989 tian@@ anmen square massacre .
though the issue of the arms embargo has shad@@ owed the china - eu summit , the two parties signed several trade and other agreements during the meeting .
both china and the eu hailed the agreements as having strengthened the " strategic partnership " between them .
" the eu side confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo , " said the eu , in a joint statement released after the summit with chinese premier wen ji@@ abao .
the statement said that the chinese delegation " welcomed the positive message and considered it beneficial to the sound development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between china and the eu " .
wen ji@@ abao did not hide his dis@@ pleasure at a press conference after the summit , saying the embargo " fails to reflect the partnership between china and the eu " .
" the embargo is a result of the cold war and does not reflect the present situation or the partnership between china and the eu , " wen ji@@ abao said .
some eu countries led by france are pushing for a lifting of the embargo , saying the ban is outdated .
without amending or strengthening related eu laws , some far@@ sighted people in the eu worry that lifting the embargo could open the floo@@ dg@@ ates to arms sales , which could boost china 's military forces .
" i explained that the eu is willing to lift the embargo but i also noted that lifting the ban is inter@@ related with adjustments of the code of conduct on arms exports , " said du@@ t@@ ch prime minister bal@@ ken@@ end@@ e .
preliminary study finding : fol@@ ic acid may lead to breast cancer , but no conclusion made
a latest he@@ ath study reported that " fol@@ ic acid , " a vitam@@ in b widely taken by pregnant women to prevent fet@@ al mal@@ formation , may increase the risk of breast cancer .
but the researchers said their results could merely be the result of chance , as other studies have suggested that fol@@ ic acid actually reduces the risk of breast cancer , so they urged pregnant women to continue taking the supplement .
fol@@ ic acid is found naturally in dark , lea@@ fy vegetables and is known to the medical community as a crucial aid in the growth of the f@@ etus .
researchers from the universities of bri@@ st@@ ol and ab@@ er@@ deen in britain followed 3,000 women who took either five milli@@ grams or 0.2 milli@@ grams of fol@@ ic acid or a placebo in the 1960 s when they were pregnant , mostly during the second and third phases of their pregnancy .
by september 2002 , breast cancer rates among those women who took the five - milli@@ gram fol@@ ic acid were twice as high as those who took the placebo alone , said the report published in a british medical magazine .
ness , one of the researchers , stressed the results were merely " preliminary . . . aimed at pointing out the way for further research . "
" it is entirely possible that this is a result of chance , so further scientific studies are required to examine the association , if there is any , before we reach any conclusions , " he said .
ness said women planning to become pregnant should still take fol@@ ic acid suppl@@ ements .
he said the current dos@@ age recommendation " is far from the experimental dos@@ age . "
according to british health guidelines , women hoping to become pregnant or in the first phase of their pregnancy should take 0.4 micro@@ gram fol@@ ic acid daily , which is more than 10 times smaller than the d@@ oses taken by those women in the study described above .
ukraine 's presidential vote re@@ run with two candidates in totally different m@@ oods
the two rivals , who will face off in ukraine 's presidential re@@ match vote on the 26 th of this month , are now prepared for a final du@@ el .
y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko , the pro - west opposition leader is confident of winning the election , while y@@ anu@@ kov@@ ich , the pro - moscow sitting prime minister said he was no longer in the election representing the " shameful " ruling party .
meanwhile russian president pu@@ tin made an about turn on ukraine 's bid to join the european union , saying he would be pleased to see ukraine 's entry into the eu .
when asked about the percentage of vote he expected to get in the re@@ match , y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko told a press conference packed with reporters : " modestly speaking , i should be able to get some 60 percent . "
on the other hand , a visi@@ bly f@@ id@@ g@@ ety y@@ anu@@ kov@@ ich evaded answering reporters ' questions several times and finally uttered only one sentence : " by god 's wish we will win . "
y@@ anu@@ kov@@ ich , whom the incumbent president ku@@ chma had originally gro@@ omed as his successor , now changed t@@ ack and positioned himself as a candidate fighting both the opposition and the ruling party .
" i used to trust those cow@@ ards and tra@@ itors who worked under the government , and now i feel disappointed . . . the government is really shameful , " he said , nearly mentioning particular names .
as a qu@@ id pro quo between ku@@ chma and the opposition party , some of the presidential powers will be transferred to parliament by amending laws , in order to end two weeks of mass opposition resistance and political turmoil following the november 21 presidential run@@ off .
the victory of the original winner y@@ anu@@ kov@@ ich was annul@@ led by the supreme court , which ruled that the poll was bes@@ et by negligence and must be re@@ run .
pow@@ ell visits ha@@ gue , making final effort for european - us harmony during his tenure
us secretary of state pow@@ ell held talks with top eu officials today , making a final push in his tenure for unity between the united states and europe .
pow@@ ell 's european tour is aimed at m@@ ending the diplomatic damage between the two parties caused by the war in iraq , and the ha@@ gue is the last leg .
pow@@ ell , on perhaps the last official overseas visit in his tenure , won an eu commitment that the eu would step toward easing the tension before a february visit to europe by us president bush .
however , the differences between the two sides still persist .
" we have to intensify bilateral dialogue and re@@ discover common ground in the second term of president bush , " said du@@ t@@ ch foreign minister bo@@ t , whose country currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu .
eu external relations commissioner ms . wal@@ d@@ ner said she believed europe and the us had already made progress on " putting the difficult moments of the iraq crisis behind them , " but she also acknowledged that now was a " key moment in the european - us relationship . "
bush will fly to brussels on february 22 to meet with eu and nato leaders .
pow@@ ell said the purpose of bush 's visit would be m@@ ending the split caused by iraq .
pow@@ ell visited so@@ fia and brussels earlier in his european tour , but achieved only limited progress in the attempt to improve relations .
especially in brussels , pow@@ ell criticized six anti - war nato countries , saying their refusal to participate in the ira@@ qi training missions had harmed the " credibility and cohesion " of the alliance .
but pow@@ ell maintained that his meetings had demonstrated the us commitment to restoring full diplomatic ties .
bas@@ escu elected as roman@@ ian president , faces the challenge of forming government
roman@@ ian opposition candidate bas@@ escu today won the heated presidential campaign , but the center - right bu@@ cha@@ rest mayor may face tremendous challenges in forming the new government due to a fr@@ agmented multi@@ partisan parliament .
according to the final official results released today by the central electoral committee , the justice and truth alliance candidate bas@@ escu gar@@ nered 5@@ 1.@@ 23 percent of the vote , while his rival , prime minister n@@ ast@@ ase , got 4@@ 8.@@ 77 percent .
n@@ ast@@ ase conc@@ eded defeat and offered his congratulations to bas@@ escu .
outgoing president ili@@ escu also congratulated bas@@ escu .
n@@ ast@@ ase said his social democratic party would assist bas@@ escu with romania 's smooth entry into the european union .
the social democratic party won the parliamentary elections held on the 28 th last month .
bas@@ escu told a press conference , " today my top priority is to form , as soon as possible , a government capable of continuing negotiations for romania to join the eu , " and romania must try to meet the requirements for joining the eu .
he stressed that the roman@@ ian people should know the costs of this integration , and that the whole nation should unite to ensure there were no voices questioning the integration of romania .
romania has completed its eu membership talks and is expected to join the eu in january 2007 .
also included in bas@@ escu 's administrative priorities are fighting against poverty , eliminating corruption , and ensuring judiciary independence .
storm over past works not cal@@ med , ol@@ i@@ ver stone seeks peace with turkey
movie director ol@@ i@@ ver stone , in ist@@ an@@ bul promoting his new film " al@@ ex@@ ander , " took the chance today to try to make friends again with turkey .
his screen@@ play for the classic " midnight express " was criticized as tarn@@ ishing the image of turkey .
" i never thought the screen@@ play would be hostile to turkey ; it was intended to be against injustice everywhere , " he told af@@ p in an exclusive interview here .
public opinion in turkey has condemned stone since the first showing of the award - winning 1978 film .
the film was adapted from the memoirs of bil@@ ly ha@@ yes .
ha@@ yes , a young american , was caught at ist@@ an@@ bul airport when he tried to smugg@@ le indian hem@@ p out of turkey . he was sentenced to 30 years in a turk@@ ish jail after a protracted lawsuit .
critics in turkey have accused stone of turning ha@@ yes 's original work into a rac@@ ist screen@@ play , in which every turk@@ ish character is depicted as a r@@ asc@@ al without exception .
the film is also full of sc@@ ary prison scenes of rape and torture .
" maybe it was because i was young at that time and wanted to make the point too eagerly and too strongly , which resulted in some z@@ eal@@ ousness and some anger , " stone acknowledged .
but he added : " ha@@ yes did get so@@ dom@@ ized in the turk@@ ish jail . he was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for a relatively neg@@ ligible offense and was treated bru@@ tally in prison . so everything was based on the facts .
" seen from a larger perspective , turkey is not the only country where the prison system does n 't work well . the united states has similar problems , " stone said .
japan 's economic growth may slow down next year
japan 's economy may slow down towards 2005 as yen appreciation and a widening gap between the rich and poor could break the harmonious atmosphere it enjoyed in the first half of this year .
though high corporate profits and strong consumer spending have restored japan 's confidence this year after a decade of stag@@ nation , analysts count on china to bolster economic growth despite growing political tensions between japan and china .
the evidence is emerging that japan 's economy could decline briefly in early 2005 , especially if industrial production continues to decrease and manufacturers adjust inventories to avoid a gl@@ ut .
based on the new statistical method recently adopted , japan 's economy actually contracted slightly in the april - june quarter and grew only 0.1 percent in the july - september quarter , narrow@@ ly evading a technical recession .
currently , economists remain widely separated on the strength of japan 's economic rebound .
researchers from france - based b@@ n@@ p par@@ i@@ bas bank estimate japan 's economic growth may hit 2.3 percent in real terms for both the current fiscal year to next march and the next fiscal year .
they call 2005 " the year of recovery " on the grounds that the us economy is strongly back on the track of recovery and japanese consumer spending is making up for the slowdown in exports .
a more pessimistic view is from u@@ f@@ j institute economists , who estimate only 1.8 percent growth for the current fiscal year and a growth rate as low as 0.6 percent for the next fiscal year .
they cite " potential risks , " meaning that corporate profits do not lead to an increase in personal incomes .
french foreign minister : middle east peace process tests french - us relations
following his meeting with us secretary of state pow@@ ell today , french foreign minister bar@@ n@@ ier said restoration of the middle east peace talks would " test " their trans - at@@ lan@@ tic relations .
france called for a quick international seminar to push ahead the israeli - palestinian peace process after the death of palestinian leader ar@@ afat . but there were no sign of an agreement at the end of the meeting between bar@@ n@@ ier and pow@@ ell .
bar@@ n@@ ier flew to washington from paris for a lightning round of talks with pow@@ ell and his designated successor , national security adviser rice , before heading to brussels for a european union summit .
while both paris and washington agreed to mend their strained ties after the us invasion of iraq last year , there were still obvious differences on resolving the middle east impasse .
" we hope to improve the future ties between france and the us and between europe and america , " bar@@ n@@ ier said after a brief discussion with pow@@ ell at the us state department .
" i think the test at the heart of this relationship is our ability to push ahead the peace process between palest@@ ine and israel , " he said .
bar@@ n@@ ier called earlier this week for an early international seminar on the middle east to take advantage of what he called a " window of opportunity " that emerged after ar@@ afat 's death last month .
but pow@@ ell remained unwilling to make a promise .
he said the two spoke of a british plan to hold a meeting which palest@@ inians will be attending , but they did not mention whether a broader international conference would be held .
us officials have said their priority was to promote local peace in israel and palest@@ ine and ensure smooth palestinian election next month .
the election will produce a leader who can control isl@@ amic militants and revive talks between the isra@@ elis and the palest@@ inians .
japanese foreign minister mach@@ im@@ ura proposes f@@ ta talks between japan and south korea next january
japanese foreign minister no@@ bu@@ tak@@ a mach@@ im@@ ura proposed today that japan and south korea hold talks on signing a free trade agreement ( f@@ ta ) at an early date in january next year .
ji@@ ji press reported that in a meeting with south korean foreign affairs and trade minister ban ki - moon in i@@ bu@@ su@@ ki city , southern japan 's k@@ ago@@ shima prefecture , mach@@ im@@ ura said the two sides should resume talks at an early date as authorities in tokyo and se@@ oul both expected to sign an f@@ ta by the end of 2005 .
the talks between mach@@ im@@ ura and ban ki - moon followed a summit on the 17 th between japanese prime minister jun@@ ichiro ko@@ izumi and south korean president ro@@ h mo@@ o - hy@@ un , in which ro@@ h mo@@ o - hy@@ un urged tokyo to be cautious over imposing economic sanctions on north korea .
as north korea abduc@@ ted more than one japanese national during the cold war , prime minister ko@@ izumi is under huge pressure from the public to punish north korea .
the families of ab@@ duction victims were outr@@ aged after japanese researchers concluded last week that the remains presented by py@@ ong@@ yang in a bid to prove the deaths of the hostages were not the remains of those kidnapped .
apart from the kidnapping issue , ko@@ izumi and ro@@ h mo@@ o - hy@@ un both agreed that the six - party talks aimed at preventing north korea from developing nuclear weapons should resume as soon as possible .
since the stand - off was provoked in october 2002 by north korea 's secret nuclear weapons program , three rounds of six - party talks have been held but have achieved no concrete results .
north korea later boy@@ cot@@ ted the fourth round of six - party talks originally scheduled for september this year .
the six nations in the six - party talks are south korea , north korea , the united states , china , japan and russia .
thai prime minister th@@ aksin still widely expected to win general election next february
on the eve of 2005 , thai prime minister th@@ aksin is confident of winning a second four - year term , but his reputation is tarn@@ ished for his failure to qu@@ ell a bloody separatist insur@@ gency .
with thai national elections scheduled for february 6 next year , th@@ aksin and his political rivals are gearing up for the election campaign . most analysts believe that despite the fierce violent conflicts in the south and the bird flu , he is still expected to win .
a total of 12 people died in thailand this year from bird flu , which swept across much of asia but was particularly severe in thailand , where the thai government acknowledged it " made mistakes " in coping with the epidemic .
however , this health issue is unlikely to der@@ ail th@@ aksin 's re@@ election . instead , many ask only how clear his sweeping victory will be , and what his victory will mean for the muslim insur@@ gency in the southern provinces .
" the phenomenon here is that no matter how you look at th@@ aksin , he now enjoys popular support , " cho@@ on@@ ha@@ van , chairman of the senate 's foreign affairs committee , told af@@ p .
" but things will begin to fall apart next year , if you look at the accumulation of wealth ( by his family and people close to him ) , the social inj@@ us@@ tices and violence , " he said .
it was the issues of social inj@@ us@@ tices and violence that led to the insur@@ gency in the muslim - majority region in thailand 's southern end , where spor@@ adic separatist rebel@@ lions have persisted since january .
since january this year isl@@ amic rad@@ icals have made bud@@ d@@ hists , government officials and security forces targets in gun@@ fights , as well as bombings and be@@ head@@ ings . so far more than 560 people have been killed , and another 100 are missing .
palestinian cabinet secretary says ar@@ afat poisoned about a year ago
ar@@ afat was poisoned a year ago when he received a delegation of supporters in the ram@@ al@@ lah headquarters , the late palestinian leader ar@@ afat 's cabinet secretary ab@@ del@@ ra@@ hman disclosed .
" something strange happened to ar@@ afat around a year ago , on september 25 , 2003 , " ab@@ del@@ ra@@ hman told the al - ha@@ y@@ at newspaper .
" at that time , the president vom@@ ited after shaking hands one by one with some 30 supporter representatives .
the president 's health started deteriorating from then on . "
ar@@ afat died in a french hospital of an unknown illness on november 11 .
several top palestinian officials believed ar@@ afat had been poisoned .
but french doctors said there was no medical basis for such allegations .
two weeks before the visit of the delegation mentioned by ab@@ del@@ ra@@ hman , the israeli prime minister shar@@ on 's cabinet had just made a decision to " remove " ar@@ afat from his post , although without specifying by what means .
israel 's threat triggered waves of public support for ar@@ afat , who therefore received several supporter delegations .
" ar@@ afat shook hands with those people who came to express their support for ar@@ afat in israel 's confinement , " ab@@ del@@ ra@@ hman recalled .
ar@@ afat received two groups on september 25 last year : one was a group of cyclists from around the world advocating peace , and the other was a group of political activists .

us president bush admitted today that ira@@ qi forces were not yet ready to replace the us troops and warned that the general election slated for january 30 next year would not mark an end to the violent insur@@ gencies in iraq .
bush , in a one - hour press conference , also expressed support for defense secretary rum@@ s@@ feld , believing the p@@ ent@@ agon chief was " doing a fine job . "
bush said that despite occasional sharp dis@@ cord , he vowed to keep working with russian president pu@@ tin , saying now it 's time to progress towards ending the middle east conflict .
he also believed that multinational diplomacy was the best way to address the problems of surviving " axis of evil " members iran and north korea .
after yesterday 's two successive car bombings in iraq 's holy shi@@ ite muslim cities of na@@ j@@ af and kar@@ bal@@ a that killed 66 people and wounded more than 200 , bush admitted the insur@@ gencies have cost the ira@@ qi people a price but insisted on holding the general election in january as scheduled .
bush issued a warning to americ@@ ans that iraq 's elections " are just the beginning of a political process " and warned that " i certainly do n 't expect the process to be smooth sailing . "
bush admitted the training of ira@@ qi security forces produced mixed results .
" when there are heated clashes sometimes , they ( the ira@@ qi forces ) flee the battlefield , " he said .
he said such ira@@ qi forces would never be able to safeguard national security and that was unacceptable .
but he believed the training would be fruitful after the ira@@ qi forces finish a long period of training by the us military .
white house : ira@@ qi insurg@@ ents ' attempt to disrupt elections doomed to fail
talking about the attacks by insurg@@ ents at noon today on a us military base dining hall in northern iraq 's big city mo@@ sul , which killed 22 people and left more than 60 wounded , white house spokesman mc@@ cl@@ ell@@ an said terrorist activities by ira@@ qi insurg@@ ents would be increasingly rampant as iraq 's elections were drawing near , but that these " enemies of freedom " would definitely be eliminated .
reports from iraq said officers and soldiers were having lunch when a single huge blast hit the dining hall at a us military base , causing severe casualties .
the interim ira@@ qi government is scheduled to hold its first election on january 30 after the down@@ fall of the hus@@ sein regime .
the united states has sent nearly 20,000 new troops to keep iraq safe during the elections .
there will be a total of 150,000 american troops in iraq during the elections .
mc@@ cl@@ ell@@ an said that as the elections drew closer , hard@@ core insurg@@ ents loyal to hus@@ sein would generate more attacks in the attempt to der@@ ail the transitional government and return to the past , but that " they 'll be eliminated and they are being eliminated . "
as for the results of a new poll , which showed that 56 percent of americ@@ ans considered the war in iraq " not a worthwhile battle , " 57 percent dis@@ approved of president bush 's way of handling situations in iraq , and 52 percent believed defense secretary rum@@ s@@ feld should step down , mc@@ cl@@ ell@@ an said president bush would not dance to the tune of the polls .
" polls are only figures at one time , and we are continuing our job based on the progress being made in iraq . "
sad crowd attends funeral procession of philipp@@ ine political figure po@@ e
a thr@@ ong of movie fans today attended the funeral of po@@ e , the philipp@@ ines ' most famous movie star , held under tight security amid fears of an insur@@ gency .
po@@ e , who died at 65 , was defeated in the presidential election .
the coffin carrying the deceased po@@ e was escorted by a crowd of mour@@ ners , as it was pulled through the streets of the capital man@@ ila on a carriage drawn by two white horses .
hundreds of riot police were deployed around the mal@@ ac@@ an@@ ang palace to prevent po@@ e 's supporters from launching unrest .
these people accused president ar@@ royo of ri@@ gging the may 10 presidential election .
the military also was on heightened alert as intelligence suggested a possible coup to overthrow ar@@ royo and replace her with po@@ e 's widow roc@@ ess .
however , the funeral ended peacefully , with fans shouting po@@ e 's initi@@ als f@@ p@@ j and waving the presidential campaign posters he had used .
po@@ e died of a stroke on december 14 .
crying women and children shed flowers on the coffin as the hear@@ se wound its way towards the cemetery .
the mal@@ ac@@ an@@ ang palace , close to the route of the funeral procession , used huge shipping containers as make - shift barriers amid justice secretary gon@@ z@@ ales 's warning that some could use the funeral to stir up trouble .
gon@@ z@@ ales said there was a " credible intelligence report " of a plot to use the funeral procession and burial to provoke the masses to turn against the government .
but armed forces spokesman lieutenant colon@@ el pas@@ c@@ ual said the coup plot apparently ended in smoke after the military deployed troops to guard key areas .
president ar@@ royo later went outside the mal@@ ac@@ an@@ ang palace to greet the troops and police on guard there .

us deputy secretary of state arm@@ itage warned sy@@ ria today , saying that the development of future relations between dam@@ asc@@ us and washington hing@@ ed on sy@@ ria 's willingness to cooperate with the us on iraq and le@@ banon .

the contents of the interview were released earlier by the state department .
asked whether he expected relations would remain strained between the us and sy@@ ria , arm@@ itage said : " i certainly hope the ties will improve , but it 's up to how ( sy@@ rian president ) ass@@ ad and his group behave . "
the second highest ranked figure of the us state department said dam@@ asc@@ us should implement un security council resolution 15@@ 59 passed in september this year for an early stop to all its interv@@ entions in neighboring le@@ banon .
arm@@ itage said sy@@ ria 's behavior " is not against the united states , but is in dis@@ cor@@ dance with the entire international community . "
reporters pro@@ bed whether the us would raise the issue of sy@@ rian non - compliance when the un security council discusses the continued presence of the un peacekeeping forces in le@@ banon in january next year . arm@@ itage 's reply was : " we may very well do that . "
on the issue of iraq , arm@@ itage admitted that dam@@ asc@@ us had indeed taken some actions in line with us expectations , such as stepping up border patrols jointly with iraq and blocking insurg@@ ent funding sources .
but he also said sy@@ ria " needs to make more efforts . "
ait and cc@@ na@@ a today sign lease on ne@@ i@@ hu site for new building
the american institute in taiwan ( ait ) signed a lease with the coordination council for north american affairs today on a site for a new building in ne@@ i@@ hu . director of the ait 's tai@@ pei office dou@@ glas pa@@ al said a new building is being designed and he hopes for its early completion so as to conduct business in a safe and modern environment .
dou@@ glas pa@@ al and chen chung , secretary - general of the coordination council for north american affairs , signed the 99 - year lease on a site for the ait 's new office building at noon at the grand hy@@ att hotel tai@@ pei .
the witnesses were d@@ avid ke@@ eg@@ an , deputy director of the ait tai@@ pei office , and j@@ acqu@@ eline liu , deputy secretary - general of the coordination council for north american affairs ; minister of foreign affairs tan sun chen was also present at the ceremony .
ait , with offices in tai@@ pei and k@@ ao@@ hsiung , was created under the taiwan relations act to handle non - official ties between the american and tai@@ w@@ anese peoples .
it was at least over ten years ago when ait began working with the coordination council for north american affairs and the tai@@ pei city government to locate a plot of land for the construction of a new ait office building , said dou@@ glas pa@@ al in his remarks .
he said the current offices on hsin yi road looks quite old and are indeed short of space .
for ait , relocation to a new office building will be a challenge . ait can consolidate all of its offices currently scattered throughout tai@@ pei and do business in a safe and modern environment .
he said he hopes the new building , which is under planning and designing , will not only help enhance the beauty of tai@@ pei but also become the pride of tai@@ pei citizens .
upon completion of the planning and designing , tenders will be invited for the construction contract and construction can begin after the builder is selected . hopefully construction can start in a few years .
ait spokeswoman d@@ ana smith said the whole building is expected to cost about 160 million us dollars , including everything from land rent to design and construction costs ; whether it can be completed by 2008 is up to many factors , but it is hoped work will start as soon as possible .
several thousand followers thr@@ ong in be@@ th@@ le@@ h@@ em for ch@@ rist@@ mas eve mass
several thousand followers were gathering in be@@ th@@ le@@ h@@ em , the west bank , for ch@@ rist@@ mas eve mass .
meanwhile fat@@ ah , the mainstream faction of the palest@@ ine liberation organization , looked likely to beat ham@@ as in yesterday 's palestinian local elections .
regarding violence and conflicts , three young palest@@ inians were killed in gun@@ fights between israeli troops and palestinian gun@@ men in ga@@ za .
israeli settlers blocked a main road , protesting mortar attacks on the settlements .
the palest@@ ine liberation organization leader ab@@ bas was also permitted on a trip to the west bank town of be@@ th@@ le@@ h@@ em , which was the first time in the past four years that israel had allowed the top palestinian leader to attend ch@@ rist@@ mas celebrations .
the late palestinian leader ar@@ afat was a frequent guest at midnight mass after his return to the palestinian lands in 1994 , but ar@@ afat had been confined by israeli troops to his headquarters in ram@@ al@@ lah since early december 2001 .
the l@@ atin patri@@ arch of j@@ er@@ usalem , sab@@ b@@ ah , left j@@ er@@ usalem shortly after mid@@ day today and began his traditional march to m@@ anger square in be@@ th@@ le@@ h@@ em , where several thousand ch@@ ris@@ tian followers and muslim onloo@@ kers have being waiting for a long while .
sab@@ b@@ ah was to address several thousand followers at a midnight mass in the church of the n@@ ativity .

israeli authorities have eased travel restrictions as a special measure to make it easier for ch@@ ris@@ tians from the ga@@ za strip , the west bank , and israel to attend the ch@@ rist@@ mas eve mass in be@@ th@@ le@@ h@@ em .
pu@@ tin says acquiring main asset of yu@@ k@@ os aimed at protecting national interests
russian president pu@@ tin said today that russia was protecting its national interests by acquiring the main asset of the russian oil giant yu@@ k@@ os , in what was the first ren@@ ation@@ alization of the post - soviet era .
at a year - end press conference in the k@@ rem@@ lin , referring to the acquisition by the russian state petroleum company of yu@@ k@@ os 's subsidiary yu@@ g@@ ans@@ kne@@ f@@ te@@ ga@@ z , pu@@ tin said : " today russia is using absolutely legal market mechanisms to protect its national interests .
i think that is completely normal . "
the russian state petroleum company today became the new owner of yu@@ g@@ ans@@ kne@@ f@@ te@@ ga@@ z after buying the bai@@ k@@ al@@ fin@@ ans@@ group that had won a secret auction for yu@@ g@@ ans@@ kne@@ f@@ te@@ ga@@ z .
the russian state petroleum company announced surprisingly shortly before midnight yesterday that it had acquired 100 percent of the shares of the previously unknown bai@@ k@@ al@@ fin@@ ans@@ group .
the acquisition sec@@ ures k@@ rem@@ lin control of russia 's vital energy sector .
russian authorities have been attacking the yu@@ k@@ os company and its imprisoned billi@@ on@@ aire founder k@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky for almost 18 months .
the russian state petroleum company is merging with the russian state gas company , and with the inclusion of yu@@ g@@ ans@@ kne@@ f@@ te@@ ga@@ z , the combined three will account for a fifth of russia 's oil output and all its natural gas production , making it the largest global energy group .
pu@@ tin justified the state 's current acquisition by criticizing the fraudulent 1990 s privati@@ z@@ ations .
the privatization measures at that time handed the most precious assets of the russian economy to a handful of well - connected businessmen such as k@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky .
bai@@ k@@ al@@ fin@@ ans@@ group earlier won control of yu@@ g@@ ans@@ kne@@ f@@ te@@ ga@@ z by offering 9.@@ 35 billion us dollars .

it takes weeks to deliver relief supplies to ace@@ h victims : un
the united nations said today that it would take " weeks " before vital relief supplies could be delivered to tsunami victims in isolated areas of indonesia 's ace@@ h province .
us navy helicopters today flew into b@@ anda ace@@ h , the capital of ace@@ h province , as an increasing number of field hospitals were operating in the city and relief supplies poured into the airport .
but director of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in indonesia , el@@ m@@ qu@@ ist , told the correspondent that it was impossible to rapidly deliver the relief supplies due to various coordination and infrastructure problems .
" it will take weeks before we send the relief supplies to all the isolated areas , " el@@ m@@ qu@@ ist told the correspondent over the telephone after returning to capital jakarta from b@@ anda ace@@ h .
" it 's a worrying problem and we are leaving no stones un@@ turned to establish a distribution system for b@@ anda ace@@ h , " he said .
the un and other relief organizations have warned residents in indonesia 's su@@ mat@@ ra disaster area may die within days if they fail to immediately get clean water , staple food , and medical treatment .
asked if the delayed delivery was nothing else than a death sentence for some tsunami victims , el@@ m@@ qu@@ ist replied : " i hope not . i hope that people manage to get food and water , but obviously it 's not a situation we are pleased to see . "
he said : " it 's a very serious situation and we can only hope there 's possibility to expedite the operations . "
japan offers 500 million us dollars for disaster relief , the largest amount among of all countries
japan today pledged 500 million us dollars in support of countries hit by the massive indian ocean tsu@@ nam@@ is . as countries race to give a hand to victims of the world 's worst disaster , the donation from japan has ranked it no . 1 among all countries and increased to 1.6 billion us dollars the total amount so far pledged internationally for relief and reconstruction .
japanese prime minister jun@@ ichiro ko@@ izumi said in a statement that japan , as asia 's largest economy , would consider more assistance , including money and expertise .
he said : " japan will do its best to provide assistance in three aspects : financial resources , knowledge and expertise , and human resources . "
" for the time being , japan will give affected countries and related international organizations 500 million dollars of cash donation as emergency assistance to handle the disaster , " he said .
ko@@ izumi also said he would attend a meeting of world leaders on the 6 th in the indonesian capital jakarta to discuss aid for the countries hit by tsunami .
the united states yesterday increased its assistance ten - fold to 350 million us dollars after us president bush was criticized for being slow to respond to the massive human disaster .
china , which is seen as increasingly having an intention to challenge japan 's influence in asia , also pledged 6@@ 0.5 million us dollars , a large sum for a developing country .
ko@@ izumi said : " japan will make more contributions by mobilizing helicopters and the personnel of the fire department . "
" japan will also consider , as soon as possible , additional efforts , including utilizing japan self - defense forces aircraft , ships and personnel . "

a foreign ministry spokesperson said the 30 million us dollars was included in the 500 million mentioned by ko@@ izumi .
50 groups to provide medical assistance to indonesia 's ace@@ h : who
50 aid groups had arrived in indonesia 's ace@@ h province to provide medical assistance to survivors of the tsunami , the world health organization said today .
the who 's indonesian representative p@@ eter@@ sen said the who was trying to coordinate all the groups and held a meeting with them this afternoon .
p@@ eter@@ sen said coordination was very difficult because many groups had gone directly into ace@@ h for disaster relief .
" we are trying to sort it out , each of the group has just come , but every group has expressed a great willingness to cooperate , " p@@ eter@@ sen said from jakarta in a telephone interview .
p@@ eter@@ sen reiterated the who 's main concern was to prevent outbreaks of epidemics such as cholera and diarrhea , which could kill thousands of people .
p@@ eter@@ sen said : " we are very worried because we have a lot of people homeless who do n 't have sufficient clean water or adequate food .
so everything is ready for epidemic outbreaks . "
however p@@ eter@@ sen stressed there had been no signs of such problems from diseases so far .
indonesia 's health ministry said the number of people killed in su@@ mat@@ ra in the tsunami may hit 100,000 , with most of the victims in ace@@ h province .
as most medical facilities were destroyed in ace@@ h province , the indonesian military and the governments of singapore and australia have set up at least eight field hospitals in the past week , and the united nations children 's fund has begun delivering basic medical kits to aid 200,000 children .
pow@@ ell predicts shi@@ ite victory in ira@@ qi general election
us secretary of state pow@@ ell predicted today that shi@@ ites would win in the upcoming ira@@ qi elections , but down@@ played the concern for increased ir@@ anian influence in iraq in case of a shi@@ ite victory citing past dis@@ cor@@ dance between ir@@ anian and ira@@ qi shi@@ ites .
there are growing indications that sun@@ ni musli@@ ms may either boycott the january 30 elections or be banned from the elections by relevant ira@@ qi authorities for spreading insur@@ gency .
on american n@@ b@@ c 's " meet the press " show , pow@@ ell said : " the new government coming into power , the transitional national assembly , will be majority shi@@ ite .
the majority of the ira@@ qi population is also shi@@ ite . "
shi@@ ite musli@@ ms make up over 60 percent of the ira@@ qi population , with most of them living in the southern and central parts of the country .
sun@@ nis live in central and western provinces , accounting for about 20 percent of the population .
former ira@@ qi foreign minister p@@ ach@@ achi , who now heads the sun@@ ni - dominated ira@@ qi independent democrats party , called today for postp@@ oning the elections , but pow@@ ell said the ira@@ qi elections would go on as scheduled .
pow@@ ell also said he felt it was impossible that shi@@ ite control of iraq 's future government would mean political situations in iraq would be dominated by iran .
" i now believe that even though there may be ir@@ anian influence - - and iran will certainly try to influence political situations in iraq , there is significant difference and past serious dis@@ agreements and conflicts between ir@@ anian and ira@@ qi shi@@ ites , " he said .
as waves of international aid pour in , time increasingly unfavorable to tsunami victims
foreign aid troops are dropping food and setting up clean water supply systems in areas hit by the asian tsunami to help millions of homeless and star@@ ving survivors .
statistics show the death toll has climbed to just below 150,000 .
relief supplies poured in from world governments , while us president bush entrusted his father senior bush and former president clinton with the task of raising private donations .
a delegation headed by us secretary of state pow@@ ell arrived in thailand late yesterday ahead of a crisis summit on the 6 th in the indonesian capital jakarta to show us concern and assess the progress of relief efforts .
pow@@ ell 's entourage included president bush 's younger brother , fl@@ or@@ ida governor je@@ b bush , and us agency for international development administrator nat@@ si@@ os .
pow@@ ell was to head the delegation to inspect the devast@@ ation in thailand , indonesia , and s@@ ri lan@@ ka before attending the summit on the 6 th .
pow@@ ell said that he had headed a delegation here to assess the devast@@ ation " and see what else the us might need to do , " but would n 't immediately pledge any more aid besides the 350 million us dollars already promised .
now days after the catastrophe , there has been talk of giving up the search for thousands of tourists still missing , many of them foreign tourists .
however , thai prime minister th@@ aksin vowed the search would go on in his country .
" foreign experts have told me that they ( the missing ) may have been buried in mud in mang@@ rove forests . we will continue to try our best to search and will not stop , " th@@ aksin told reporters on p@@ hu@@ ket island .
an unprecedented international relief effort is going on .
navy helicopters dispatched from the us aircraft carrier lin@@ coln are performing the tasks of dropping aid and picking up survivors for a second day in indonesia 's ace@@ h province .
rear adm@@ ir@@ al crow@@ der , commander of carrier lin@@ coln , said 50,000 sterling pounds of food and water had been delivered to disaster - hit areas and the mission was " going well . "
political maneu@@ vering hidden under righteous acts of aid for asian tsunami catastrophe
as aid floods into areas hit by asia 's tsunami disaster , something less noble is also secretly underway : governments are w@@ rang@@ ling over who should give , who should receive and who should dominate in the largest relief effort in modern times .
the catastrophe that has killed nearly 150,000 people has re@@ kin@@ dled old battle flames , including the dis@@ cor@@ dance between the united states , united nations , and europe and the struggle to be the leader in asia .
but relief experts still hold cautious hope . considering that the tsunami has hit so many countries , the global nature of the catastrophe might lead to another precedent : governments pled@@ ging aid will really make good on their promises .
" there has never been a time where governments follow through their promises 100 percent and on time , " said jum@@ a , a professor of international development at har@@ v@@ ard university 's ken@@ nedy school of government .
with donations from governments already as high as two billion us dollars , major players in international politics including un secretary general ann@@ an and us secretary of state pow@@ ell , as well as leaders of australia , china , and japan will hold a crisis summit rich with political over@@ tones on the 6 th in jakarta .
us president bush has raised us assistance nearly ten - fold to 350 million us dollars after being accused of a slow response and un relief chief eg@@ eland openly lam@@ b@@ asted rich nations for being " st@@ ing@@ y . "
in asia , the tsunami catastrophe fu@@ eled hidden wrest@@ ling for regional influence as an increasingly confident china promised 6@@ 0.5 million us dollars in aid , a large sum for a developing nation .
japan , which has been cutting down on its foreign aid budget for six consecutive years , acted quickly to smash any allegation that its national strength was declining by pled@@ ging to donate at least 500 million us dollars , a sum that d@@ war@@ fed all other countries .
world leaders desc@@ ending on s@@ ri lan@@ ka to inspect devast@@ ation

ann@@ an 's plan to visit rebel - held area in s@@ ri lan@@ ka was blocked
un secretary general ann@@ an said today that he wanted to return to s@@ ri lan@@ ka one day to " see every part of the country . "
ann@@ an has just ended a two - day visit in tsunami - hit areas of s@@ ri lan@@ ka , but reports said the s@@ ri lan@@ kan government blocked him from visiting northern areas held by the rebels .

russian space agency denies rocket fuel causes illness among children
the british weekly science journal nature reported that highly toxic rocket fuel , spur@@ ted from russia 's space ship launches at the bai@@ k@@ on@@ ur space base in kazakhstan , has caused serious diseases among children in the vicinity . russian space agency today denied such suggestion .
the nature science journal published today quoted a study , saying that levels of end@@ ocr@@ ine and blood diseases among residents in polluted areas are twice as high as in normal regions .
the study was conducted by epidem@@ i@@ ologist zy@@ kov , who led a group of russian scientists .
" it 's not confirmed that space - related activities have a direct influence on the health of residents , " the russian space agency responded .
the study quoted by nature science magazine focused on children in the al@@ tai republic .
the al@@ tai republic is located in a mountainous region on the fr@@ ing@@ es of si@@ ber@@ ia .
the al@@ tai republic was chosen as the study subject because of pollution from un@@ burnt fuel , especially hy@@ dra@@ z@@ ine .
some of russia 's space launching missions use hy@@ dra@@ z@@ ine as the fuel during the early stages of take - off .
zy@@ kov compared the health records of some 1,000 children in two polluted areas for the years 1998 - 2000 with 3,@@ 300 health records of a nearby un@@ polluted control group .
he concluded that the percentage of children needing medical care in the worst - polluted areas was twice as high as that of the un@@ polluted control group , and that the duration of treatment was also twice as long , the nature science journal reported .

us trade deficit in november tops 60 billion us dollars , setting fresh records
according to data released by the us commerce department today , us exports sh@@ rank 2.3 percent in november last year , sending the trade deficit to an all - time high of 6@@ 0.3 billion us dollars .
while exports fell to a five - month low of 9@@ 5.6 billion us dollars , imports rose 1.3 percent to a record 15@@ 5.8 billion as orders for imported oil increased by 1.3 percent , or more than 2 billion dollars , to a record 14.@@ 2 billion .
the trade gap increased 7.7 percent from october 's revised 56 billion dollars and soared sharply by 5@@ 0.8 percent from 40 billion for november of the previous year .
wall street economists had expected the trade deficit for goods and services to shrink to about 5@@ 3.3 billion us dollars , according to a survey conducted by c@@ bs market@@ watch .
although the weakening dollar has made us - made products cheaper both at home and abroad , the us trade deficit continues to widen .
today 's report from the commerce department will put more pressure on the green@@ back and renew calls for washington to act on energy independence and the trade imbalance with china .
the decline in us exports for november last year was the result of a 1.4 - billion - dollar slump in capital goods , including a drop of 325 million us dollars in aircraft and aircraft engines .
exports of industrial materials , most are energy related , fell by 800 million us dollars .
exports of auto@@ s , consumer goods and food also dropped .
japan 's defense agency chief : remember militar@@ ist past , respect dignity of neighboring countries
japan 's defense agency chief yo@@ sh@@ in@@ ori on@@ o said today that japan would not forget its militar@@ ist past and would keep in mind the " dignity " of asian neighbors as it took a higher profile internationally .
" while we get along with southeast asian nations , we should never forget the past , " on@@ o said when asked about possible un@@ ease over japan 's dispatch of troops to tsunami - hit areas in south asia .
he told reporters : " we must build a relationship with friendly nations , which allows us to tell them we have good intentions .
we should pay full respect to the dignity of other countries while we are looking at the past . "
on@@ o particularly noted that this year marked the 60 th anniversary of the end of second world war and said : " we want to be re@@ born and cooperate for the sake of a new era . "
on@@ o , who has just wound up his visit to several tsu@@ nam@@ is - hit counties in south asia , said he felt the " dignity " of an independent country when indonesian leaders told him that japanese troops should finish their relief mission by the end of march at the latest .
the united nations has voiced concern over the deadline the indonesian government has imposed on foreign troops .
foreign troops are widely praised for reaching some of the re@@ mo@@ test tsunami survivors .
nearly 1,000 members of japan 's self - defense forces are heading to countries rav@@ aged by the december 26 tsu@@ nam@@ is that have so far killed more than 16@@ 3,000 people .
this is the biggest deployment of japan 's self - defense forces since the end of the second world war .
japan 's us - dominated post@@ war constitution stipulated that the self - defense forces must not use force .
political intervention in nh@@ k program ? debate erup@@ ts in japanese media
allegations that pressures from politicians forced the public - run japan broadcasting corporation ( nh@@ k ) to shorten a program aired a few years ago on japan 's sla@@ very of comfort women during world war ii have left liberal japanese media at odds with their conservative counterparts .
liberal japanese media have ass@@ ailed nh@@ k for sl@@ ashing large portions of interviews it had conducted , mostly with critics of japan 's wartime conduct and victims of ens@@ la@@ ved comfort women , allegedly after discussions with senior political leaders .
but conservative newspapers have justified nh@@ k 's decision to e@@ dit the show , believing the company 's senior management has a duty to ensure its programs are fair and objective .
the controversy erupted last week over a 2001 program that featured a mock trial on the crime of the japanese military of ens@@ la@@ ving comfort women during wartime .
the trial , held by a women 's rights group in tokyo in december 2000 , found the late emperor hi@@ ro@@ hi@@ to guilty of allowing the sla@@ very of comfort women by japanese military during japan 's occupation of asian nations .
historians say at least 200,000 young women , mostly from korea but also from taiwan , china , the philipp@@ ines , and indonesia , were forced to serve as comfort women in frontline japanese military bro@@ th@@ els during wartime .
the program 's producer sat@@ or@@ u n@@ ag@@ ai held a t@@ ear@@ ful press conference on the 13 th , disclosing that before the program was aired , senior nh@@ k officials met with lawmakers of the ruling liberal democratic party , sh@@ in@@ zo a@@ be and sho@@ ichi n@@ ak@@ ag@@ awa , both of whom had expressed concerns over the content of the program .
n@@ ag@@ ai said top nh@@ k officials then edited and shortened the program .
" nh@@ k b@@ owed to political pressure , " he said .
a@@ be and n@@ ak@@ ag@@ awa admitted meeting with nh@@ k officials and telling them to be " fair " but firmly denied pres@@ suring the company .
euro@@ zone data show core inflation under control
economists said today that euro@@ zone economic data to be released this week would show core inflation remained under control .
meanwhile , euro@@ zone industrial output and french consumer spending are both expected to fall .
the european union 's statistics office euro@@ st@@ at is expected to confirm that inflation edged up to 2.3 percent in december from 2.2 percent in november when it releases inflation data on the 20 th of this month .
but the increase largely reflects the rise in tobacco tax , and core inflation is expected to remain at 1.9 percent .
core inflation figures are to be released with consumer prices figures .
economists noted core inflation , which ex@@ cludes food , energy , tobacco and alcohol prices , has remained in a 1.6 to 2.0 percent range for the past two years .
european central bank president tr@@ ich@@ et said on the 13 th that short - term price pressures have dwind@@ led recently .
while inflation will remain above two percent in the coming months , it is likely to drop by the end of this year .
meanwhile , another economist said the euro@@ zone november industrial output due on the 18 th is expected to fall , given growth slowdown in germany .
german industrial output declined 1.7 percent in november , and a survey among economists conducted by af@@ p financial news services shows euro@@ zone output would slip another 0.4 percent in november after a 0.5 percent fall in october .
euro@@ zone industrial output is expected to rebound in december , said sch@@ mi@@ eding of bank of america .
bureaucracy adds to the w@@ oes of tsunami survivors
three weeks after the worst tsunami in history , survivors are struggling with v@@ ices such as bureaucracy and politic@@ king , while the world 's attention has turned elsewhere .
thousands of rotten corpses dug out of the debris drove the death toll from the december 26 tsunami catastrophe to more than 16@@ 8,000 , while the upcoming ira@@ qi elections and president bush 's inauguration gala have replaced the tsunami as the headlines in global media .
indonesia had initially asked foreign troops involved in humanitarian missions to leave the country within three months , but later took back the demand .
in thailand , leaders of canada , sweden , norway and finland were gathering for a discussion over a reconstruction plan and efforts to identify the dead .
but survivors are faced with new difficulties , such as inv@@ eter@@ ate bureaucracy in indonesia , which hin@@ ders the distribution of aid pouring in from across the world .
" we are like persons who do not exist . we have suffered great losses in the tsunami , losing everything and are star@@ ving , " said bus@@ ri@@ adi , a fisherman in a small village near the capital of ace@@ h province , b@@ anda ace@@ h , on indonesia 's su@@ mat@@ ra island .
he said : " where are the food , the clothes and other relief supplies we see on television flooding into ace@@ h ?
bus@@ ri@@ adi , like thousands of disaster - battered survivors , lost his identity cards and other official documents due to the tsunami , which makes his efforts to gain aid a nightmare .
although he beg@@ s government officials for help and shuttle everyday from one place to another to go through all sorts of formalities , the results are always the same : he is not able to get relief supplies .
zeng qing@@ hong reportedly visited zhao zi@@ yang before his death
chinese vice president zeng qing@@ hong visited zhao zi@@ yang , the de@@ posed former general secretary of the chinese communist party , in the hospital just before he died this morning , the hong kong - based china information center for human rights and democracy said .
the information center said that according to zhao zi@@ yang 's family , zeng qing@@ hong visited zhao zi@@ yang at the beijing hospital at 6:00 am this morning , about an hour before he died at the age of 85 .
zhao zi@@ yang once served as the general secretary of the cc@@ p and premier . he was dismissed from office in 1989 for opposing the use of force to suppress the democratic movement in tian@@ anmen square . he had been under house arrest and deemed person@@ a non gr@@ ata by the government ever since .
the information center said that according to zao 's family , the sitting premier wen ji@@ abao , who once worked as zhao zi@@ yang 's subordinate , did not visit him when he was critically ill .
but retired central committee member and his one - time aide tian ji@@ yun visited him before zhao zi@@ yang slipped into a coma on the 14 th .
the information center for human rights and democracy has maintained contact with zao 's family and has for years issued timely and correct information on zhao zi@@ yang 's situation .
the information center said some 20 retired top party , government and military leaders were preparing an open letter to the cc@@ p , calling for a re@@ appraisal of zhao zi@@ yang 's contributions and demanding a public funeral for him .
the center also said that zhao zi@@ yang 's family would not be allowed to hold or organize the funeral and the party would make the final decision on arrangements .
zhao zi@@ yang 's wife , liang bo@@ qi , is 86 years old .
the center added she had not been told of her husband 's death as of this early evening due to her poor health .
zhao zi@@ yang passed away , china urged to promote democratization
zhao zi@@ yang , a former leader of the chinese communist party , was highly commended worldwide after he died of illness today . japanese prime minister jun@@ ichiro ko@@ izumi , the tai@@ w@@ anese government , and overseas chinese democracy activists all coinci@@ ded in appeals to beijing to carry out zhao zi@@ yang 's vision of democratic reforms .
zhao was dismissed from office in 1989 for opposing the military suppression of the democratic movement at tian@@ anmen square . he was put under house arrest for the rest of his life and died this morning at a beijing hospital at the age of 85 .
" i hope they ( china ) are committed to democratization , " japanese prime minister jun@@ ichiro ko@@ izumi said while mourning for zhao zi@@ yang , according to reports by ji@@ ji press .
taiwan also urged china to carry out democratic and political reforms after zhao 's death .
overseas chinese democracy activists regarded zhao zi@@ yang as " one of china 's greatest reform@@ ers , " who sacrificed his political life to oppose the bloody suppression of the democratic movement at tian@@ anmen square .
lian sh@@ eng@@ de , president of new york - based free china movement and once a student movement leader , said : " during his 15 - year house arrest , he publicly advocated the need for political reforms and progress towards the rule of law and democracy .
zhao zi@@ yang will be remembered by later generations as a true democr@@ at and a person of principle . "
democratic activists have requested china hold a public funeral for zhao zi@@ yang and give fair appraisal for his achievements .
but they acknowledged zhao zi@@ yang was unlikely to receive such courtesy because the chinese government feared that the masses , dissatisfied with the rule of the communist party , would take this opportunity to start an insur@@ gency .
the 1989 student movement was prompted by the death of pro - reform leader hu yang@@ bao .
xinhua news agency released a brief report today , saying that comrade zhao zi@@ yang died in beijing due to illness , which is the only official comment on the matter .
wealthy nations not fulfilling promise to slash poverty - stricken population : un
wealthy nations are not making good on their promise to provide financial aid aimed at hal@@ ving the world 's population in extreme poverty by 20@@ 15 , a un - appointed panel of experts said in a new report .
rich nations around the world have committed themselves to the un 's ambitious " millennium development goals " program to improve the fate of the world 's poor and suffering .
but with more than one billion people worldwide living on less than a dollar a day and 2.7 billion people surviving on less than two dollars , the un experts said time is running short for wealthy nations to fulfill their promises .
" with the right mobilization of resources and political will , and reforms in developing countries as well as in developed countries , these goals are still achiev@@ able , " said brown , head of the un development program .
the un experts said the world 's 22 richest nations had promised to give 0.7 percent of their g@@ d@@ p to aid the developing nations , but they were only delivering 0.25 percent .
un secretary general ann@@ an commissioned development experts , led by former har@@ v@@ ard economist s@@ achs , to write the report on the progress of the goals , which include wiping out extreme poverty , making primary education universal , cutting the child mortality rate , and fighting aids and other deadly diseases .
the report said : " the practical solutions exist . the political framework is established . and for the first time , the cost is affordable . all that is needed now is action . "
un announces establishing global disaster warning system
the united nations announced it would set up a global disaster warning system to guard against fierce natural disasters .
but after south asia 's massive tsunami tragedy , differences remained on which country 's technology to use .
un agencies said in a joint statement released after a global conference in ko@@ be , japan that un experts would establish a disaster warning system to reduce damage by fierce natural disasters .
serious devast@@ ations caused by south asia 's massive tsunami have outr@@ aged indian ocean nations .
br@@ ic@@ en@@ o , director of the international strategy for disaster reduction organization said : " the new program will bring peace and security to human beings .
an effective early warning system would safeguard the lives and security of millions of people around the world .
but in large part , the un 's announcement is only symbolic .
an official at un@@ es@@ co said more key discussions were needed regarding the disaster warning system .
un@@ es@@ co is spear@@ heading the establishment of a global disaster warning system .
" right now we have different programs proposed by several countries , so we need to do coordination work , " said b@@ ernal , director of un@@ es@@ co 's inter@@ governmental ocean@@ ographic commission .
b@@ ernal said the commission would hold two meetings within 60 days , in the hope of deciding which country 's tsunami warning system they would pick .
one of the meetings would be in paris , and the other was yet to be determined .
b@@ ernal hoped a decision could be made in july so the system could be completed and in operation by mid-@@ 2006 , the target date set by un@@ es@@ co .

shanghai becomes world 's no . 1 power generating equipment producer in output and capacity
shanghai , december 1 , xinhua ( reporter jiang wei ) with the completion of the trial - run of a 660 - meg@@ aw@@ att generator unit , shanghai tur@@ bine generator co , . l@@ t@@ d , a subsidiary of the shanghai electric power generation group , reached the annual production target of 15,000 - meg@@ aw@@ att units on the 1 st , ahead of schedule . this makes shanghai the world 's no . 1 producer of power plant equipment in both output and capacity , realizing the long - time dream of several generations of workers in china 's equipment manufacturing industry .
the shanghai electric power generation group is the largest power plant equipment manufacturing base in china .
in recent years , with the rapid growth of demand for power generating equipment in china , generator manufacturers across the country have entered a period of high growth and great development .
the shanghai electric power generation group has integrated its advantageous resources in power generating equipment such as steam tur@@ bines and power plant boilers . after taking orders of four units of million - kilow@@ att thermal generators , it received production orders for nine heavy gas generator units and three waste - heat boilers by way of a lump sum tender .
at the same time , through integrated operations , it further improved the efficiency of enterprise management , technical development and production .
at present , the shanghai electric power generation group represents 40 percent of china 's power plant equipment industry and is continuously expanding its overseas market in the middle east , southeast asia and south america .
this year alone , as a producer of components for the main@@ frames of power generating equipment , the shanghai tur@@ bine company received sales orders valued at 6 billion yuan .
the " electricity shortage " this summer has significantly driven up the demand for power plant equipment across the nation , and competition in the power plant equipment manufacturing market is increasingly hot , said zheng ji@@ an@@ hua , president of the shanghai electric power generation group .
the group is implementing the three grand targets of " researching and developing million - kilow@@ att thermal , gas tur@@ bine generator units and million - kilow@@ att nuclear power " so as to realize the goal of being listed in the global 500 at an early date .
( hong kong , mac@@ au , taiwan ) hong kong observ@@ atory provides new services to world meteorological organization websites
hong kong , december 2 ( xinhua ) hong kong 's observ@@ atory launches two new services , starting today , for the " world weather information service " and the " severe weather information center " websites maintained by the world meteorological organization .
a spokesman at the observ@@ atory said the two new services were : adding global official weather observation on clou@@ din@@ ess and rain to the " world weather information service " website , and adding a rec@@ ap function of the tropical cyclone tracks for the past seven days to the " severe weather information center " website .
these two new services come right after hong kong 's observ@@ atory began to provide official observation data on global heavy rain ( including snow ) for the " severe weather information center " early this year .
it was mentioned that the " world weather information service " website has been providing official weather forecasts and monthly mean climatic data for major world cities .
the new service provides , for the first time , global official weather observation , with the global distribution graph@@ s of clou@@ din@@ ess and rain as its first service .
the new web page features a wide coverage and high density and is updated regularly , up to eight times a day .
the new product on the " severe weather information center " website is a rec@@ ap function for tropical cyclone tracking .
in the previous design , the website would no longer store information , such as the location , of a tropical cyclone once it had dissip@@ ated .
however , there are people who would like to obtain relevant information about a tropical cyclone several days after it has landed .
therefore , the new product stores information on the intensity , location and track of tropical cycl@@ ones for the past seven days , allowing the public and the media to retrieve needed information after the tropical cyclone has landed and dissip@@ ated .
world 's first rapid diagnostic kit for h@@ 5@@ n@@ 1 bird flu virus successfully developed in sh@@ an@@ tou
sh@@ an@@ tou , december 3 , xinhua ( zhang yi@@ wen and lin jun@@ qiang ) the reporters learned from the sh@@ an@@ tou university 's medical college / university of hong kong 's medical faculty joint influenza research center that they have developed the world 's first rapid diagnostic kit for h@@ 5@@ n@@ 1 bird flu virus , after half a year of cooperation with xi@@ amen 's university .
using this rapid ass@@ ay to test specimens from suspected cases , the diagnosis of bird flu infection can be made in as short as less than an hour .
based on existing information , bird flu , which is listed as a highly toxic killer virus , has a mortality rate far higher than that of the s@@ ars virus , said professor guan yi , director of the sh@@ an@@ tou university 's medical college / university of hong kong 's medical faculty joint influenza research center .
previously it would take between 3 to 5 days , and sometimes more than a week to confirm " suspected " viruses .
the successfully introduced rapid test for bird flu viruses uses the en@@ zy@@ me - linked immun@@ os@@ or@@ bent ass@@ ay and the gold - lab@@ eling ass@@ ay to test specimens such as excre@@ ta , nas@@ al ph@@ ar@@ yn@@ ge@@ al secre@@ tions , ch@@ ick embry@@ o - cultured intact virus or split virus , as well as ser@@ um . the diagnosis of bird flu virus infection may be reached in one to two hours .
the new techniques are easy , convenient and rapid , and allow for detection in the outbreak site . with an accuracy of more than 90 percent , they help with early detection , early diagnosis , early isolation and early treatment of the infectious virus , avoiding wide epidemic and severe plague .
commissioned by the chinese center for disease control and prevention , sh@@ an@@ tou university 's medical college / university of hong kong 's medical faculty joint influenza research center recently hosted a training workshop on bird flu virus ass@@ ay techniques for trainees from 20 provincial and municipal centers for disease prevention and control across the country , on which the latest rapid ass@@ ay techniques for bird flu virus were demonstrated .

the spokesman said that the speech delivered on the 2 nd in hong kong by m@@ r . hy@@ de , chairman of the us house international relations committee , v@@ iciously attacked china 's development and progress , and s@@ mea@@ red china 's foreign policy with cold - war mentality ; " we are strongly dissatisfied with it " .
the spokesman said it is widely known that china 's development is not only in the fundamental interest of 1.3 billion chinese people , but also contributes to the world 's prosperity and development .
china is a responsible country in the international political arena and has played a positive and constructive role in maintaining world peace and stability .
regarding nuclear non - proliferation , china has all along strictly complied with relevant international conventions , firmly opposed nuclear proliferation in all forms , and advocated settlement of such issues through negotiations , talks and by strengthening international monitoring .
the spokesman noted that m@@ r . hy@@ de , unfortunately , ignored these facts and made those extremely irresponsible comments at a moment when the sino - us relations are heading towards soundness and stability . this is completely against the common understanding reached recently between the chinese and us leaders on bilateral ties , it contrad@@ ics the mainstream voices in american society advocating the strengthening of cooperative relations with china , and will undoubtedly do harm to the development of sino - us relations .
china 's biggest sea water des@@ al@@ in@@ ization project set@@ tles in zhou@@ shan
hang@@ zhou , december 6 , xinhua ( pan y@@ ifeng and xu qun ) the biggest ever sea water des@@ al@@ in@@ ization project in mainland china , with a daily treatment volume of up to 10,000 tons , will settle in the pu@@ tu@@ o district of zhou@@ shan city , in the province of z@@ hejiang .
for residents of zhou@@ shan , who have long suffered from water shortages , the vast sea water besides them will soon become clear and sweet tap water streaming into thousands of households .
the reporters learned from relevant authorities that the state ocean@@ ic administration 's hang@@ zhou water treatment technology development center and the government of li@@ u@@ heng town in zhou@@ shan 's pu@@ tu@@ o district signed a cooperation agreement a few days ago on a ten - thousand - ton sea water des@@ al@@ in@@ ization project .
with a 50 million yuan investment and a daily fresh water output of 10,000 tons , the project so far is the biggest sea water des@@ al@@ in@@ ization project in mainland china . the first phase of the project is expected to be completed next year .
zhou@@ shan city is one of the water - star@@ ved cities in china .
there are a total of 1,3@@ 90 islands , large and small , across the city , with an average fresh water availability of 60@@ 1 cubic meters per person , which is only 25.@@ 4 percent of the average level for z@@ hejiang province . the water supply problem has long disrupted the lives of residents in the island city .
li@@ u@@ heng town in the pu@@ tu@@ o district , for example , has to transport 1,500 tons of fresh water from a nearby town every day , and the cost per ton is over 10 yuan .
the reverse os@@ mos@@ is sea water des@@ al@@ in@@ ization technology developed by the state ocean@@ ic administration 's hang@@ zhou water treatment technology development center is a pressure - driven film separation process , a hot topic in current international sea water des@@ al@@ in@@ ization research .
responsible personnel from the center said that through technological improvement and equipment localization , the cost and power consumption of the reverse os@@ mos@@ is sea water des@@ al@@ in@@ ization project have both been sl@@ ashed .
the cost of des@@ al@@ in@@ izing one ton of sea water will drop further to the level of 5 yuan .
this fore@@ bo@@ des that the cost of sea water des@@ al@@ in@@ ization is likely to be close to the prices of tap water and industrial water .

construction of underground power plant to begin soon for three gorges project
wu@@ han , december 8 , xinhua ( reporter shi yong@@ feng ) bids were publicly invited for the first time on december 8 for the main part of an underground power plant for the three gorges project , a prelude to the construction of the three gorges underground power plant .
the three gorges project is designed to install twenty - six 700,000 - kilow@@ att hydraulic generator units , with an installed capacity of 18.@@ 2 million kilowatts . once the generator units are all in production , the average power generation per year will be 8@@ 4.7 billion kilow@@ att hours .
with the aim to further explore the power generating potential of the three gorges project , the three gorges project has reserved spaces in its initial design for building an underground power@@ house as an extension project .
according to officials at the china three gorges project corporation , the three gorges underground power plant is laid out in the mountains on the right bank of the three gorges dam , with major buildings such as the intake tower , diversion tunnel , main plant , tail@@ race system , bus@@ bar shaft and 500 k@@ v trans@@ former sub@@ station .
the underground power plant will have six 700,000 - kilow@@ att generator units .
this will increase the number of generator units installed in the three gorges project to 32 from 26 designed originally and the installed capacity will soar to 2@@ 2.4 million kilowatts from 18.@@ 2 million kilowatts , which will significantly strengthen the power generation capability of the three gorges project .
flood prevention is the top priority for building the three gorges project .
based on the operation schedule of the three gorges reservoir , the water level in the three gorges reservoir will be lowered from the normal pond level of 175 m to the flood control level of 145 m each year before the flood season .
therefore , the construction of the underground power plant will increase the water usage rate of the three gorges reservoir , reduce water loss and increase power generation , thus maxim@@ izing the time of peak regulation without water loss .
currently , the earlier phase projects of the three gorges underground power plant , such as ad@@ it excavation , tail@@ race canal excavation and tim@@ bering , have begun in advance .
it is said that the underground power plant will be fully completed and put into production by the end of 2008 .

experts proposes setting up a spokesperson system for minors in china
shanghai , december 13 , xinhua ( reporter liu dan ) " china 's youth social education forum - - 2004 media and minor development " that closed in shanghai on the 13 th proposed that china should set up a spokesperson system about the conditions of minors , which regularly releases news about their development status and problems .
a survey conducted by a relevant organization in shanghai showed that minors read extra curriculum books for an average of 1.@@ 17 hours per day per person , watch tv for 1.@@ 05 hours , and browse the internet for 0.@@ 99 hours , meaning that in the extra curriculum schedule of minors , about half the time is spent with the media . and the media is becoming a factor not neg@@ ligible in minors ' growth and development as a brand new social force .

said chen tian@@ qiao , chairman of shanghai 's sh@@ anda networking development co . , l@@ t@@ d .
while the media is creating good conditions for minors to grow up s@@ oundly , the need for market competition and economic interests , plus the low quality of some media staff , has made opinions in some articles misleading for the thinking and values of teenagers , and some media even spread violent and pornographic content .
currently there are over 2,000 television channels and more than 1,500 radio frequencies in china broadcasting 1,8@@ 68 radio programs , and the number of net sur@@ fers within the country is as high as 87 million .

( international ) united nations warns more death from drug abuse expected globally in 2005
vienna , december 17 , xinhua ( reporter song gu@@ o@@ cheng ) cost@@ a , executive director of the united nations office on drugs and crime , warned in a press release on the 17 th that due to increased heroin yield in af@@ gh@@ anistan , heroin is expected to trade at a stable price in black markets in 2005 and with higher purity , causing more deaths among drug users .
cost@@ a has sent warnings to officials at health and drug prevention organizations in europe and surrounding countries , urging those countries to closely follow the latest trends of drug cultivation in af@@ gh@@ anistan and international drug crime , and take appropriate precautions .
according to statistics from the vienna - based un office on drugs and crime , in 2001 , when opium cultivation was banned in af@@ gh@@ anistan , heroin yield in af@@ gh@@ anistan declined by 94 percent , and the purity level of heroin in european black markets dropped 50 percent a year later .
deaths from drug abuse in europe fell by 20 percent from 2000 to 2002 .
cost@@ a said af@@ gh@@ anistan 's opium cultivation area this year increased by 64 percent compared to 2003 , and heroin yield topped 500 tons , which is more than the volume of global black market heroin trade for the whole year , a trend meaning higher purity on a global scale and commensurate increase in the number of deaths attributed to drug abuse .
cost@@ a believed drug sources in af@@ gh@@ anistan have posed " clear and present threats " to global drug prevention efforts , and a greater supply of heroin in black markets means " death sentences " to drug users .
it is estimated the number of deaths worldwide from over@@ d@@ oses is approximately 100,000 a year .

this is the second gu@@ ant@@ an@@ amo prisoner the us military has ruled out as an enemy combat@@ ant .
eng@@ land said the p@@ ent@@ agon confirmed the prisoner 's identity a few days ago , and the state department would inform the prisoner 's country of this decision and make arrangements for his release .
but he did n 't disclose the prisoner 's name or nationality , and the circumstances under which he was captured .
eng@@ land refused to admit that the defense department had made a mistake in determining the identity of the gu@@ ant@@ an@@ amo prisoner .
he said the military review panel responsible for reviewing the identity of gu@@ ant@@ an@@ amo prisoners reviewed 50@@ 7 prisoners , confirming the identity of 230 , of whom 228 were correctly classified as enemy combat@@ ants .
the united states has released some 200 gu@@ ant@@ an@@ amo prisoners so far ; some were freed after repatriation to their home counties and a few others are still in jail after their return , but at least 12 have taken part in activities against the us troops after being released .
around 550 " al - q@@ a@@ eda " and tal@@ i@@ ban suspects are currently being held at the us naval base in gu@@ ant@@ an@@ amo , most captured during the us - af@@ gh@@ an war .
the us government calls these people enemy combat@@ ants instead of prisoners of war , and so they are not protected by the geneva convention .
many countries have criticized the us government for detaining their citizens indefinitely , as well as some international organizations that condemned these acts of the us as violating international law .

domain names , which are now widely used as internet addresses , are the communication basis for carrying out all internet applications such as e - business and e - government .
when visiting websites or acc@@ essing email , people have to first enter domain names . through the resolution service of a domain name system , domain names are converted to ip addresses , and website hosts are then found , enabling information transfer .
a domain name system is like the " nerve system " that controls information transfer on the internet .
china has more than 90 million internet users as of now , which is the second largest number worldwide , and the number of websites has topped 6@@ 50,000 , said mao wei , director of china 's internet network information center , the administrator of china 's country code top - level domain name system .
the volume of domain name resolution is proportional to internet users , and with the fast development of the internet , the volume of domain name resolution also increases rapidly .
at present , registration of cn domains grows by 10,000 every month , with a total number of 4@@ 30,000 .
the country code top - level domain name server run and managed by china 's internet network information center processes over 380 million domain name resolution requests every day , with an average of over 4,@@ 400 requests processed in one second and a peak value of 8,000 .
faced with the fast development of the internet , china 's internet network information center , china 's domain name registration administration , had to re@@ evaluate this year the four original top - level no@@ des for country code domains across the country and re@@ deployed cn domain top - level no@@ des based on the results of said re@@ evaluation .
based on local internet development and software and hardware conditions at access organizations , it was decided to install a top - level no@@ de for country code domains in shanghai .
we learn that shanghai currently has 45,000 cn domain names and 2@@ 6.6 percent of the population are internet users . its internet penetration rate and application skills are second to none in the country .
the east china region surrounding shanghai , with 13@@ 0,000 cn domain names and 23@@ 0,000 websites , is also a leader in terms of development .
therefore shanghai was chosen as the first no@@ de in the re@@ deployment plan .

in the early 1980 s , when the world 's annual hard alloy output was 25,000 tons , china produced 5,000 tons of hard alloy a year ; stepping into the 21 st century , the world 's annual hard alloy output is 3@@ 8,000 , while china 's hard alloy production per year has soared rapidly to 15,000 tons , or more than one - third of the hard alloy output in the world .
china has also made significant progress in hard alloy export .
china 's annual hard alloy export was just 100 tons in 1986 , and the export volume had reached 2,500 tons by 2003 . the export volume is expected to reach more than 3,000 tons this year , which , like the output , also accounts for one - third of the circulation in worldwide hard alloy markets . the foreign currency earned annually through hard alloy export increased from below four million us dollars a year in the past to 70 million us dollars a year nowadays .
ad@@ b loan supports sh@@ anxi to harness coal@@ bed and coal@@ field gas for power
beijing , december 23 , xinhua ( reporter jiang gu@@ o@@ cheng ) the reporter learned from the asian development bank 's china office on the 23 rd that the ad@@ b recently approved a loan of 1@@ 17.@@ 4 million us dollars to help build a power plant that will harness the meth@@ ane produced from coal mining in the southern part of the sh@@ anxi province .
the coal@@ bed gas development demonstration project will use the latest technologies to boost the output of coal@@ bed and coal@@ field gas to fuel a 120 - meg@@ aw@@ att power plant that will soon be built .
under the project , by the time of its completion in 2008 , the project will provide about 90,000 households and industrial and commercial users with at least 166 million cubic meters of coal@@ bed gas per year .
this will benefit some 4@@ 10,000 in the j@@ in@@ cheng area .
coal output in sh@@ anxi accounts for about one third of the country 's total production .
the total cost of the project is estimated at 237 million us dollars , of which a loan of 20 million us dollars will be offered by japan 's bank for international cooperation and a loan of 3@@ 7.@@ 86 million us dollars will come from the industrial bank of china .
the j@@ in@@ cheng municipal government and two local mining / industrial groups will provide equity capital totaling 6@@ 1.@@ 24 million us dollars .
the united states trade and development agency also provided a grant of 500,000 us dollars .
meth@@ ane is called coal@@ bed gas when it is obtained from wells built by drilling from the surface into underground coal@@ beds , and called coal@@ field gas when the it is produced in underground coal mining operations .
meth@@ ane is a highly explosive gas and needs to be dr@@ ained first in coal mining operations to ensure a safe working environment .
removal , capture and use of meth@@ ane will reduce greenhouse gas emissions , contributing to the allevi@@ ation of global warming and climate change .
the greenhouse effect of meth@@ ane is 21 times that of carbon dioxide .
substituting meth@@ ane for coal increases fuel cleanliness , improves coal mine efficiency , and results in cleaner air .
h@@ assing , an ad@@ b senior project specialist , said the project was expected to yield a reduction of about 4.5 million tons in carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emission .
( international ) the main treasure of israel museum is a forgery
j@@ er@@ usalem , december 24 , ( xinhua ) j@@ ames sn@@ y@@ der , director of the israel museum , said on the 24 th that the main treasure of the museum , an ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate , was confirmed a forgery a few days ago .
the ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate was once considered the only relic discovered to date from the first temple of sol@@ om@@ on 's age .
sn@@ y@@ der said in a statement that israeli authorities conducted careful appraisal of the thum@@ b - sized ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate .
experts found it should be a relic from the bronze age , far earlier than the first temple period of the je@@ ws .
a line of text on the p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate , in he@@ brew , reads : " belonging to the temple of lord y@@ ah@@ we@@ h , a holy thing to the priests . "
the inscription was confirmed to have been carved later .
the israel museum bought this ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate for 5@@ 50,000 us dollars from an anonymous collector in the 1980 s .
archaeological and relic experts had believed it was an arti@@ fact stud@@ ded on the top of a scep@@ ter for priests of the first temple , and the only cultural heritage left from that age .
sn@@ y@@ der said that before the ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate was purchased , it had been authenticated by israeli experts including an archae@@ ologist named na@@ hman av@@ ig@@ ad .
israel 's ha@@ aret@@ z newspaper reported av@@ ig@@ ad examined the arti@@ fact recklessly at that time using only a magn@@ if@@ ier .
av@@ ig@@ ad has personally denied the comment .
in recent months , israeli police successively detected three major cases of fraudul@@ ence in cultural relics , summon@@ ing several hundred people for interrogation .
the police and the cultural heritage administration accidentally found the ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate to be a forgery .
the police will press charges ag@@ ains some people involved in this case next week .
in the 10 th century b@@ .@@ c . , king sol@@ om@@ on of jud@@ ah built the first temple on what is now the temple mount to keep holy artifacts such as the ark of the covenant and no@@ ah 's ark , but these holy artifacts were later destroyed .
shenzhen will enforce the use of " reclaimed water " in some buildings and neighborhoods
guangzhou , december 26 ( xinhua ) as a major effort to build a " water - saving city , " shenzhen will enforce the use of " reclaimed water " in some larger buildings and neighborhoods . at present , relevant codes and regulations for the design of reclaimed water facilities are being formulated .
" reclaimed water " mainly refers to non@@ potable water that is for limited use and obtained from treating urban sewage or domestic sewage to a certain a level of water quality .
the quality of the water is somewhere between tap water and dr@@ ained sewage .
a large quantity is usually used in toilet flushing , garden and farmland irrigation , road cleaning , car washing , urban foun@@ tains , and water ref@@ illing for cooling equipment .
an inquiry conducted by the shenzhen water bureau shows shenzhen once had more than 70 buildings equipped with a " reclaimed water " recycling system in the middle 1990 s , but the builders had to give up the utilization as the cost of " reclaimed water " recycling was too high due to factors such as technology , design and management .
to have these pipelines play a real role , what needs to be done is to simply invest an additional 300,000 to 400,000 yuan in installing a " reclaimed water " treatment system .
if utilized , the over 70 existing " reclaimed water " pipelines can save 35,000 tons of tap water for shenzhen in one single day , based on each neighborhood using 500 tons of " reclaimed water " per day .
it was said that shenzhen will start its " reclaimed water " recycling by renov@@ ating the over 70 buildings that have existing " reclaimed water " systems , and will further expand the project after summing up experience .
in the meantime , the shenzhen municipal water department will work with the urban planning and construction departments to formulate as soon as possible codes for the design of reclaimed water , and prescribe the enforcement of " reclaimed water " use in larger buildings .
the treated " reclaimed water " will be first used in urban green area irrigation .
