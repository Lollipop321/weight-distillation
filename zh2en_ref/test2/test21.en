this week 's euro@@ zone economic indicators to show continuous economic weakening in europe
economists said that euro@@ zone economic indicators to be released this week will provide further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing economic output , while british data is expected to show a pick - up in industrial activities .
they said economic output data from the largest euro@@ zone countries will continue to be volatile from one month to the next , but the longer - term trend of output will point to slowing economic growth .
the most important economic indicators of the week will be in germany , where the z@@ ew institute 's economic expectations index , which is due on the 7 th and is closely watched by the market , will offer europe its first evidence of economic confidence in december .
the z@@ ew index fell sharply to 13.@@ 9 in november from 3@@ 1.3 the previous month .
economists said the significant appreciation of the euro will have continued to weigh on economic confidence in the latest survey , so there is no reason to expect any rebound in the economic expectations index .
" given that the main factors driving down economic confidence , including the euro 's appreciation , uncertainty over global growth and the weak labor market and worsening unemployment in germany , have remained a drag on future growth expectations over the december survey period , a strong rebound is unlikely , " b@@ n@@ p 's economists said .
according to a survey among economists conducted by af@@ x news , the af@@ p financial news subsidiary , the index will drop again to 11.@@ 0 in december from 13.@@ 9 in the previous month .
however , tea@@ ther of u@@ bs investment bank said germany 's z@@ ew economic expectations index could drop as far as zero in december .
" expectations of future german economic activity , as reflected in the z@@ ew survey of analysts and financial market participants , will continue to fall in our view , " said tea@@ ther .

russia has been accusing the west of interfering in the affairs of eastern europe , which has gradually become a focus due to the political crisis in ukraine and is expected to top the agenda of the annual ministerial meeting of the organization for security and cooperation in europe ( os@@ ce ) , which will open tomorrow .
russia is irrit@@ ated by the cre@@ eping influence of the west into corners of europe it previously considered its back@@ yard , like the bal@@ tic states , ge@@ or@@ gia and central asia . as a result , the recent incident in ukraine is likely to dominate the discussions of the two - day os@@ ce meeting in the bulgar@@ ian capital of so@@ fia .
ukraine 's supreme court has made a dramatic ruling to order a re - voting of the recent second - round presidential election . and before this , the european union had called on member states of the os@@ ce to ask their observers to get ready for " the quick@@ est and efficient actions " .

bush 's major test : intelligence reform bill to face congressional vote this week
the intelligence reform bill the us congress will take efforts to pass this week is part of an ambitious second - term agenda pushed by re@@ public@@ an president bush , whose support level among re@@ public@@ an congressmen will be his first major test after re - election .
in a newspaper interview yesterday , ke@@ an , the re@@ public@@ an who led the investigation into the september 11 , 2001 attacks on new york and washington , said the issue with the intelligence reform bill was that it has to be passed by the congress and that the matter itself aug@@ urs ill for bi@@ partisan cooperation and the president 's domestic agenda .
" congress becomes dys@@ functional if the president and congress ca n 't get these big issues taken care of , and then we 're all in trouble , " ke@@ an said .
" it 'll be a long time before there 's another bill with the support of the re@@ public@@ an and democratic leadership in both houses and the support of 80 % of the american people in the polls , " he told the new york daily news .
several lawmakers said yesterday that failure of the ground@@ breaking reform bill could delay overhaul of america 's anti@@ qu@@ ated spy network by months , years or kill it altogether .
the top democr@@ at on the house of representatives ' intelligence committee , har@@ man , yesterday told c@@ nn television that " if the bill is n 't passed this week , it dies " .
congress will try again on the 6 th and 7 th to pass the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 before adjour@@ ning until early next year .
if lawmakers fail , the entire bill will be discarded and need to be re@@ written in the congress ' 2005 session .
ukraine 's opposition strongly opposes large constitutional amendment to dil@@ ute presidential powers
ukraine 's pro - west opposition firmly insisted today that they would not accept the constitutional reform pushed by outgoing ukrainian president ku@@ chma before the second round presidential re - election .
the constitutional reform will dil@@ ute most of the president 's powers .
with the november 21 st vote declared invalid by the supreme court because of massive vote fraud in the second - round presidential elections and a new date of re - election set by the central election commission for december 26 , opposition leader y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko is locked in a fresh stand@@ off with ku@@ chma .
" if the constitutional amendment is passed in its current form , all the powers of the president would be transferred to the parliament . this would be unacceptable , " said ti@@ mo@@ sh@@ enko , an ally of y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko .
" we want the president to be able to name the head of the intelligence agency and the prosecutor general so we can fight corruption and get rid of the cl@@ ans that dominate ukraine 's political and business life , " she told reporters .
ku@@ chma , who keeps close ties to russia , had pushed for constitutional changes before the re - election amid fears that the opposition could win the presidential election .
opposition lawmakers yesterday refused to vote for government - proposed constitutional changes and the parliament adjourned for 10 days .
according to the constitutional amendment , the power to appoint all top posts excep@@ ting the prime minister , defense and foreign ministers would be transferred from the president to the parliament , where pro - government forces currently have close to a majority .
according to the amendment , the president 's nominees for the prime minister , defense and foreign ministers would need to be approved by lawmakers , who could also put forward their own candidates .
ukraine 's political crisis enters third week with opposition calling for continuous protest
the chaos caused by ukraine 's presidential election has entered its third week . opposition leader y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko today called on his supporters to continue the street protests and block the presidential palace and government buildings unless outgoing president ku@@ chma dismis@@ ses prime minister y@@ anu@@ kov@@ y@@ ch and his cabinet members and takes actions to ensure the fairness of the upcoming presidential re@@ election .
tens of thousands of y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko 's supporters have gathered in the capital of ki@@ ev for two weeks , blocking the government buildings and en@@ camping themselves on major avenues designed by soviet experts to hold military par@@ ades . the people power they have demonstrated has forced the supreme court to ann@@ ul the second round of presidential election of december 21 st and the central election commission to order a re@@ election for december 26 th . the parliament has approved the dismissal of y@@ anu@@ kov@@ y@@ ch , but ku@@ chma , y@@ anu@@ kov@@ y@@ ch 's ment@@ or , has not signed the administrative decree to fire his successor .
y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko told supporters gathered at the capital 's independence square this evening that ku@@ chma should dismiss his government , and reshuffle the central election commission . in addition , both the parliament and ku@@ chma should agree to amend the election law to prevent election fraud .
" before these decisions are made , the issue of blockade on government buildings and the presidential palace will not be discussed , " he said , starting his campaign for the december 26 election .
" over the past 14 days , the square has shown the love for ukraine and the civil consciousness of millions of ukrainian people who can defend their own choice . "
" we are undergoing a fight between good and evil . the world is appl@@ au@@ ding our victory and is proud of ukraine , " he said .
as the opposition is putting more pressure on the ruling authority backed by moscow and y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko and ku@@ chma are once again locked in a stand@@ off of constitutional reform , polish president kw@@ asni@@ ewski , li@@ thu@@ anian president ad@@ am@@ k@@ us and russian envoy gr@@ ys@@ z@@ lo@@ v are scheduled to arrive in ki@@ ev on the 6 th for another round of mediation .
egy@@ pt announces breakthrough in stalled middle east peace process
egy@@ pt says a new framework is expected to come into being for the middle east peace agreement .
it also says it is likely to return its ambassador to israel in the near future to restore the full diplomatic ties severed four years ago .
quoting " high - level " egy@@ ptian sources , egy@@ pt 's state news agency , the middle east news agency ( men@@ a ) , said parties in the search for a peace plan have gradually reached an understanding that could lead to a comprehensive reconciliation .
" an important understanding has been reached by egy@@ pt , israel , the palest@@ inians and the significant international parties , such as the united states and the european union , agreeing in principle on a comprehensive solution to the israeli - palestinian conflict , " men@@ a said .
following the death last month of veteran palestinian leader ar@@ afat , the international community has revit@@ alized its efforts to advance towards a final middle east peace policy in a bid to end at an early date years of bloody conflict between israel and palest@@ ine .
men@@ a said officials expect that " preparations would take place until july , after which political action will begin " .
men@@ a said it will be followed by a conference in washington attended by all parties concerned with the peace process , notably israel and palest@@ ine , as well as egy@@ pt , the united states , russia and several european countries .
topics of the meeting are expected to include a " bilateral ceasefire " and the palestinian authority " putting a stop to anti - israeli attacks and consolidating its control over the situation in the ga@@ za strip and the west bank . "
for this point , men@@ a said israeli prime minister shar@@ on has promised to " stop israeli military operations against the palest@@ inians insofar as they continue to respect the ceasefire deal and control their territory . "
one billion children suffer from war , poverty and aids
the united nations children 's fund ( un@@ ic@@ ef ) pointed out today in its annual report that more than 1 billion children , half of the world 's population of children , suffer from poverty , war and the s@@ cour@@ ge of aids .
un@@ ic@@ ef says the rights of children to a healthy and protected up@@ bringing , as laid out in the 1989 convention on the rights of the child , are regularly imper@@ iled , due in part to the failure of governments to carry out human rights and economic reforms .
un@@ ic@@ ef executive director b@@ ell@@ amy pointed out during the release of the report in london that " when half the world 's children are growing up hungry and unhealthy , when schools have become targets of attacks and whole villages are being emp@@ tied by aids , we 've failed to deliver on the promise of childhood " .
" too many governments are making deliberate choices that actually hurt childhood , " b@@ ell@@ amy added .
un@@ ic@@ ef has joined hands with researchers from britain 's london school of economics and bri@@ st@@ ol university to compile statistics which paint a terrible portrait of children at risk in most part of the world .
researchers have found that around 640 million children lack adequate shelter , 400 million have no access to safe water , 270 million have no access to health care services and 140 million ( mostly girls ) have never been to school in the world .
researchers point out that even worse is that at least 700 million children suffer from various forms of " severe deprivation " , which also includes a lack of access to information and public sanitation facilities .
the 10 th annual un@@ ic@@ ef report released today points out that war and aids have destroyed networks that normally protect children and at times turned them into direct victims of war and aids .
eu resists chinese pressure to lift arms embargo
the european union today re@@ buff@@ ed pressure for a quick end to the arms embargo on china from chinese premier wen ji@@ abao , but said it was working towards lifting the 15 - year - old ban .
the eu du@@ t@@ ch presidency made the remarks following a china - eu summit .
the nether@@ lands says it cannot speculate how the eu will end the embargo .
the eu imposed the arms ban on beijing after the 1989 tian@@ anmen square massacre .
although the arms embargo over@@ shad@@ owed the china - eu summit , the two sides have signed several trade and other agreements .
both china and the eu claim that such deals have strengthened their " strategic partnership " .
" the eu side has confirmed its political will to continue to work towards lifting the embargo , " said the eu in a joint statement made after the summit with chinese premier wen ji@@ abao .
the statement points out that the chinese delegation " welcomes the positive signal and considers it beneficial to the sound development of the comprehensive strategic partnership between china and the eu . "
wen ji@@ abao did n 't hide his dis@@ pleasure at a press conference following the summit . he said the ban " does not reflect the partnership between china and the eu " .
" the embargo is a result of the cold war and does not reflect the present situation nor the partnership between china and the eu , " wen ji@@ abao said .
a group of eu countries led by france is pushing for the arms ban to be lifted , saying the ban is outdated .
but some in the eu worry that without a strengthened set of eu rules , a lifting of the embargo could open the floo@@ dg@@ ates to arms sales which could improve china 's military strength .
" i have explained that the eu is willing to lift the embargo but i also must say that this is related to adjustments of the code of conduct on arms exports , " said du@@ t@@ ch prime minister bal@@ ken@@ end@@ e .
preliminary research finds fol@@ ic acid may be linked to breast cancer but link not confirmed
a new health study points out that fol@@ ic acid , a b vitam@@ in widely taken by pregnant women to protect against birth defects , has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer .
but the researchers say their results could merely be the result of chance , as other studies have suggested that fol@@ ic acid actually reduces the risk of breast cancer , so they urge pregnant women to continue taking the supplement .
fol@@ ic acid , found naturally in dark , lea@@ fy vegetables , is known to be a key aid in the growth of the f@@ etus .
researchers from the universities of bri@@ st@@ ol and ab@@ er@@ deen followed 3,000 women who in the 1960 s were given suppl@@ ements of either five milli@@ grams or 0.2 milli@@ grams of fol@@ ate , or a placebo , mostly during the second and third tri@@ me@@ sters of pregnancy .
the study published in the british medical journal says that by september 2002 , breast cancer rates were twice as high for those who took the five - milli@@ gram supplement as for those who took the placebo .
one of the researchers , ness , has stressed the results were merely " preliminary … intended to point the way towards further research " .
" it 's entirely possible that this is a chance finding , so further scientific studies are required to examine the association , if there is one , before we reach any conclusions , " he said .
ness says women planning to become pregnant should still take fol@@ ic acid suppl@@ ements .
he says there is a " considerable difference between the trial " and current dos@@ age recommendations .
according to british health guidelines , women hoping to become pregnant and those in the first tri@@ me@@ ster of their pregnancy should take a 0.4 - micro@@ gram daily supplement of fol@@ ic acid � c more than 10 times smaller than the d@@ oses given to women in the study .
two candidates in widely different mood as ukraine holds presidential re - election
the two rivals set to meet in ukraine 's presidential re - election on the 26 th this month have got ready for the run@@ off .
the pro - west opposition leader y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko is confident of w@@ ining the election while the pro - moscow incumbent prime minister y@@ anu@@ kov@@ y@@ ch says he will no longer represent the " shameful " ruling party in the election .
meanwhile , russian president pu@@ tin has changed his attitude towards ukraine 's entry into the european union , saying he supports its entry into the eu .
asked how many votes he would gar@@ ner in the re - election , y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko told a crowded press conference , " conserv@@ atively speaking , i should win around 60 % of the votes . "
on the other hand , y@@ anu@@ kov@@ y@@ ch , looking anxious and upset from his appearance , directly do@@ dged answering reporters ' questions several times , saying at last , " for god 's will , we will win . "
y@@ anu@@ kov@@ y@@ ch , who was originally chosen as a successor of incumbent president ku@@ chma , has changed his mind and positioned himself as a rival candidate against both the opposition and the ruling parties .
" i used to trust those cow@@ ards and tra@@ itors working with the government but i 'm very disappointed now . the government is shameful , " he said almost directly giving the names .
ku@@ chma and the opposition reached a compromise to transfer part of the presidential powers to the parliament by amending the law to end two weeks of massive opposition protests and political chaos since the presidential election on november 21 st .
y@@ anu@@ kov@@ y@@ ch 's victory in the election has been declared invalid by the supreme court by reason of massive electoral frauds and a re - election must be held .
pow@@ ell visits ha@@ gue in final push for eu - us harmony in his term
us secretary of state pow@@ ell today held talks with senior officials of the european union to make one last effort to push forward us - eu unity in his term .
pow@@ ell 's european tour is aimed at m@@ ending the diplomatic impairment between the two sides that has resulted from the ira@@ qi war . ha@@ gue is his last stop .
it will likely be pow@@ ell 's last official overseas trip in his term . the eu has promised him they will continue working to ease strained bilateral ties ahead of us president bush 's february visit to europe .
however , differences between the two sides still l@@ inger .
" we have to intensify the dialogue and re@@ discover some common ground during the second term of president bush , " said du@@ t@@ ch foreign minister bo@@ t , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
eu external relations commissioner ms . wal@@ d@@ ner says she believes europe and the united states have already made progress " to put the difficult moments of the iraq crisis behind us " , but she still acknowledges that it is a " key moment in the eu - us relationship " now .
bush will fly to brussels on february 22 nd to meet with eu and nato leaders .
pow@@ ell says bush 's visit is aimed at m@@ ending the f@@ issu@@ res caused by the iraq issue .
pow@@ ell has visited so@@ fia and brussels during this european trip but has only made limited progress in improving ties .
in brussels in particular , pow@@ ell criticized six anti - war european nato members for hurting the " credibility and cohesion " of the alliance by refusing to attend the training exercises in iraq .
however , pow@@ ell still firmly holds that his meetings have shown the us 's commitment towards fully restoring diplomatic relations .
bas@@ escu elected roman@@ ian president , faces challenge of forming government

dispute over past work remains ; ol@@ i@@ ver stone seeks peace with turkey
movie director ol@@ i@@ ver stone is in ist@@ an@@ bul today promoting the new film " al@@ ex@@ ander " and hoping to repair an old ri@@ ft with turkey .
his screen@@ play for the classic " midnight express " has been criticized for tarn@@ ishing the image of turkey .
" i never intended it to be against turkey . it was against injustice everywhere , " he told af@@ p in an exclusive interview .
public opinion in turkey has denounced stone since the first screening of the award - winning film in 1978 .
the film was based on the memoirs of bil@@ ly ha@@ yes .
ha@@ yes , a young american , was sentenced to 30 years in jail in turkey after a protracted legal s@@ aga that began when he was caught at ist@@ an@@ bul airport trying to smugg@@ le h@@ ash@@ ish out of the country .
critics in turkey have accused stone of will@@ fully inter@@ pol@@ ating ha@@ yes ' original book and writing a rac@@ ist screen@@ play in which every turk@@ ish character , without exception , is depicted as a vil@@ lain .
the film is also rif@@ e with hor@@ rif@@ ic prison scenes of rape and torture .
stone has acknowledged that " perhaps some of the z@@ eal@@ ousness , some of the anger came from being young and trying to make the point too much , too hard " .
but he added , " it was true that ha@@ yes did get scre@@ wed in the turk@@ ish prison . he was convicted for relatively nothing to 30 years and he was treated bru@@ tally in prison . so this is all docum@@ ented . "
" the larger picture is that turkey is not the only country whose prison system is not working properly . america has similar problems , " stone said .
japan 's economic growth likely to slow down next year
japan 's economy may be heading towards a slowdown in 2005 as a stronger yen and a growing disparity between rich and poor threaten to spoil the harmonious atmosphere enjoyed in the early part of this year .
while huge corporate profits and stronger consumer spending brought confidence back to japan this year after a decade of stag@@ nation , analysts now pin their hopes on a booming china to sustain economic growth despite growing political tensions between japan and china .
the evidence is mounting that japan 's economy could slump briefly in early 2005 , especially if industrial production continues to decline as manufacturers adjust stock inventories to avoid a gl@@ ut .
under a recently adopted new data methodology , japan 's economy actually contracted slightly in the april - june quarter and grew only 0.1 % in the july - september quarter , narrow@@ ly avoiding a technical recession .
at present , economists still differ in their views about the ro@@ bust@@ ness of japan 's economic recovery .
according to estimates by b@@ n@@ p par@@ i@@ bas researchers , japan 's economy will record a 2.3 % growth in real terms for both the current fiscal year ending in march next year and the fiscal year that follows .
they call 2005 " the year of recovery " on the grounds that the us economy is firmly on a recovery track and japanese consumer spending is taking up the slack for slower exports .
another relatively pessimistic view is from u@@ f@@ j institute economists who expect only 1.8 % growth in the current fiscal year and an even slower 0.6 % for the following fiscal year .
they have cited the " potential risk " that corporate profits have failed to lead to higher personal incomes .
french foreign minister : middle east peace process to test french - us ties
after a meeting with us secretary of state pow@@ ell today , french foreign minister bar@@ n@@ ier said that resuming middle east peace talks would be a " test " of their trans - at@@ lan@@ tic relationship .
following the death of palestinian leader ar@@ afat , france called for the rapid convening of an international conference to push forward the israeli - palestinian peace process but there was no sign of agreement between bar@@ n@@ ier and pow@@ ell after their meeting .
bar@@ n@@ ier flew into washington from paris for a lightning round of talks with pow@@ ell and his designated successor , national security adviser rice , before turning around and heading to brussels for a european union summit .
both paris and washington have agreed to repair relations strained by the us invasion of iraq last year , but differences remain clear over how to best resolve the middle east impasse .
" we want to improve future relations between france and america and europe and america , " said bar@@ n@@ ier , after a short meeting with us secretary of state pow@@ ell .
" i think the test at the heart of this relationship is our ability to launch the peace process between palest@@ inians and isra@@ elis , " he said .
bar@@ n@@ ier called early this week for an early international conference on the middle east to take advantage of what he termed a " window of opportunity " created after ar@@ afat 's death last month .
but pow@@ ell has not made any promise .
he said the two had spoken of a british plan to hold a meeting bringing in the palest@@ inians but did not mention if a broader international meeting would be held .
us officials say they have made it their priority to promote the israeli - palestinian peace to ensure smooth palestinian elections next month .
the election will produce a leader who could rein in isl@@ amic militants and resume talks with israel .
foreign minister mach@@ im@@ ura proposes japan - south korea talks for next january
japan 's foreign minister no@@ bu@@ tak@@ a mach@@ im@@ ura proposed today that japan and south korea hold talks on a free trade agreement ( f@@ ta ) as early as january next year .
ji@@ ji press reports that during a meeting with the south korean foreign and commercial minister , ban ki - moon , in the southern japanese city of i@@ bu@@ su@@ ki in k@@ ago@@ shima county , mach@@ im@@ ura said the two sides should resume talks as soon as possible , since both tokyo and se@@ oul wish to conclude the f@@ ta by the end of 2005 .
the talks between mach@@ im@@ ura and ban ki - moon followed the summit of the 17 th between japanese prime minister jun@@ ichiro ko@@ izumi and south korean president ro@@ h mo@@ o - hy@@ un , who urged tokyo to be cautious over imposing economic sanctions against north korea .
prime minister ko@@ izumi is under great public pressure to punish north korea over its abduc@@ tions of many japanese nationals during the cold war .
the families of kidnapping victims were outr@@ aged after japanese researchers concluded last week that py@@ ong@@ yang presented the remains of other people in a bid to prove that two kidnapped victims were dead .
apart from the ab@@ duction issue , ko@@ izumi and ro@@ h mo@@ o - hy@@ un mutually agreed that the six - nation talks aimed at hal@@ ting north korea 's nuclear weapons development should resume as soon as possible .
since a stand@@ off starting in october 2002 resulted from north korea 's secret development of a nuclear weapons project , three rounds of six - party talks have taken place and ended without concrete results .
north korea has boy@@ cot@@ ted the fourth round of six - party talks scheduled for september this year .
members of the six - party talks include south korea , north korea , the united states , china , japan and russia .
thai prime minister th@@ aksin still expected to win next february 's election
thai prime minister th@@ aksin is confident he will win a second four - year term heading into 2005 but his reputation has been tarn@@ ished by a failure to qu@@ ell a deadly separatist insur@@ gency .
with national elections slated for february 6 next year , th@@ aksin and his political advers@@ aries are gearing up for a battle which most analysts expect him to win despite the serious violence and bird flu epidemic in the south this year .
a total of 12 people died this year from bird flu in thailand . the bird flu swept across much of asia but was particularly devastating in thailand , where the government admitted it had " made mistakes " in its handling of the epidemic .
however , the health concern is unlikely to un@@ seat th@@ aksin . instead , many are asking only how thorough his victory will be , and what will it mean for the muslim insur@@ gency in the southern provinces .
" the phenomenon here is that no matter how one looks at th@@ aksin , he has managed to capture popularity for the time being , " k@@ rais@@ ak , chairman of the senate 's committee on foreign affairs told the af@@ p .
" but things will start to dis@@ integrate next year , if you look at the accumulation of wealth ( by his family and associates ) , the social inj@@ us@@ tices and the violence , " he said .
it is because of social inj@@ us@@ tices and violence that chaos erupted in thailand 's muslim - majority deep south , where a spor@@ adic separatist insur@@ gency occurred continuously starting in january .
since january this year , radical musli@@ ms have targeted bud@@ d@@ hists , government officials and security forces in shoo@@ tings . they also carried out bombing attacks and be@@ head@@ ings . more than 560 people have been killed and another 100 are reported missing so far .
palestinian cabinet secretary claims ar@@ afat poisoned about one year ago
late palestinian leader ar@@ afat 's cabinet secretary ab@@ del@@ ra@@ hman reveals that ar@@ afat may have been poisoned one year ago when he received a delegation of supporters in his ram@@ al@@ lah headquarters .
" something strange happened to ar@@ afat around a year ago . it was on september 25 , 2003 , " ab@@ del@@ ra@@ hman told al - ha@@ y@@ at newspaper .
" the president shook hands with around 30 supporters before leaving to vom@@ it .
it was from that moment that the president 's health started slowly deteriorating . "
ar@@ afat died in a french hospital of an unknown illness on november 11 .
some senior palestinian officials have suggested the veteran leader had been poisoned .
however , french doctors have insisted there was no medical basis for such allegations .
two weeks before the delegation 's call on ar@@ afat mentioned by ab@@ del@@ ra@@ hman , the israeli prime minister shar@@ on 's cabinet had just taken a decision to remove ar@@ afat , although without specifying by what means .
the israeli threat had prompted expressions of support for ar@@ afat , who thereafter received the visit of several delegations of supporters .
" ar@@ afat shook hands with people , who had come to express solidarity with him in his confinement by israel , " ab@@ del@@ ra@@ hman recalled .
on september 25 th last year , ar@@ afat received two delegations , one group of cyclists from around the world on a peace mission and another group of political activists .
" the last time ar@@ afat became ill , on october 12 this year , he had the same symptoms : vomiting , refusal to eat and all the symptoms of a flu , " ab@@ del@@ ra@@ hman pointed out .

bush says that despite some occasional serious differences , he has pledged to continue cooperation with russian president pu@@ tin , adding that it is the right time to move on a road leading to the end of conflict in the middle east .
he also believes that the best way to deal with the issues of iraq and north korea , existing members of the " axis of evil " , is through multilateral diplomatic mediation .
continuous car bombing attacks yesterday shocked the ira@@ qi shi@@ ite muslim 's two holy cities of na@@ j@@ af and k@@ ab@@ ala , killing 66 people and injuring more than 200 others . bush has recognized that violence has made the ira@@ q@@ is pay a price but insists that the election in january will go ahead .
bush has warned the americ@@ ans that the ira@@ qi election " is only the beginning of the political process " . he also warns " we certainly do n 't expect a smooth process . "
bush has also admitted that the training results of ira@@ qi security forces are a mixed bag .
" sometimes , when there is fierce fighting , they ( ira@@ qi troops ) will run away , " he said .
he says such ira@@ qi troops can never protect the national security , which is unacceptable .
but he believes that after being trained for a long time by the us army , ira@@ qi forces will achieve good training results .
white house : ira@@ qi rebels ' attempts to sabotage election doomed to failure
in response to rebels ' attack at noon today on a restaurant in a us military base in iraq 's major northern city of mo@@ sul , which has killed 22 and wounded over 60 others , white house spokesman mc@@ cl@@ ell@@ an said that as the ira@@ qi election is coming nearer , terrorist activities by ira@@ qi rebels will become more rampant but such " enemies of freedom " will surely be eliminated .
reports from iraq say that a large explosion occurred in a military base restaurant during lunch@@ time causing heavy casualties among the us soldiers .
the ira@@ qi interim government is scheduled to hold the first election since the overthrow of the hus@@ sein regime on january 30 th .
the united states has dispatched nearly 20,000 more troops to ensure the security of the ira@@ qi election .
the total number of us troops during the election will reach 150,000 .
mc@@ cl@@ ell@@ an says the nearer the election is , the more terrorist attacks rebels loyal to hus@@ sein will launch in an attempt to undermine the interim government . they want to turn back to the past but " they will be defeated and they are being defeated " .
as for a recent poll that shows about 56 % of the american people believing the war in iraq is " not worth fighting " , 57 % dis@@ approving of bush 's handling of the iraq situation and 52 % believing defense secretary rum@@ s@@ feld should resign , mc@@ cl@@ ell@@ an says president bush has never been one to govern based on polls .
" polls are sn@@ ap@@ shots in time , and we are working to continue to build upon the progress being made in iraq . "

however , he pointed out that sy@@ ria " needs to make greater efforts " .

meanwhile , the palestinian liberation organization ( pl@@ o ) 's mainstream fat@@ ah movement looks likely to defeat ham@@ as in yesterday 's palestinian local election .
in violent conflicts , israeli troops and palestinian gun@@ men were engaged in a gun@@ fight in ga@@ za , leaving three palestinian young men killed .
israeli settlers block@@ aded a major road to protest a mortar attack on the settlement area .
pl@@ o leader ab@@ bas had also been allowed to go to the west bank town of be@@ th@@ le@@ h@@ em , which is the first time in the past four years israeli authorities have allowed a senior palestinian leader to attend ch@@ rist@@ mas celebrations .
late pl@@ o leader ar@@ afat was a regular guest at midnight mass in be@@ th@@ le@@ h@@ em after his return to the palestinian territories in 1994 but he had been unable to attend since being confined to his headquarters in ram@@ al@@ lah by the israeli army in early december 2001 .
the l@@ atin patri@@ arch of j@@ er@@ usalem sab@@ b@@ ah is set to begin his traditional procession shortly after mid@@ day today to be@@ th@@ le@@ h@@ em 's m@@ anger square where thousands of ch@@ ris@@ tians and musli@@ ms have already been gathering .

pu@@ tin claims purchase of major assets of yu@@ k@@ os to protect national interest
russian president pu@@ tin pointed out today that russia 's takeover of the major assets of russian oil giant yu@@ k@@ os was to protect the national interest . it was also the first move of re - nation@@ alization in the post soviet era .
talking about the takeover by the russian state oil company of yu@@ g@@ ans@@ kne@@ f@@ te@@ ga@@ z oil and gas company , yu@@ k@@ os ' subsidiary company , at a year - end press conference in the k@@ rem@@ lin , pu@@ tin said , " russia is using an absolutely legitimate market mechanism to protect the national interest .
i think the move is absolutely normal . "
the russian state oil company won the bid of yu@@ g@@ ans@@ kne@@ f@@ te@@ ga@@ z 's bai@@ k@@ al finance group in a secret auction before the takeover and became the new owner of yu@@ g@@ ans@@ kne@@ f@@ te@@ ga@@ z oil and gas company today .
the russian state oil company made a sudden announcement just before last midnight that it had acquired 100 % ownership share of the previously little - known bai@@ k@@ al finance group .
the acquisition has enabled the k@@ rem@@ lin to take a firm grip on russia 's crucial energy industry .
the russian authority has been attacking yu@@ k@@ os and k@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky , its billi@@ on@@ aire founder over the past 18 months .
the russian state oil company is merging with the russian state gas company . altogether with yu@@ g@@ ans@@ kne@@ f@@ te@@ ga@@ z oil and gas company , the three will control 1 / 5 of russia 's oil production and all its natural gas production to become the world 's largest energy group .
pu@@ tin has defended the purchase move by attacking the behind - the - scene privatization process of the 1990 s .
the then privatization measures had enabled russian economy 's most valuable assets to fall in hands of a small number of shre@@ w@@ d businessmen such as k@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky .
bai@@ k@@ al finance group previously offered $ 9.@@ 35 billion in a bid to win control of yu@@ g@@ ans@@ kne@@ f@@ te@@ ga@@ z oil and gas company .

japan offers us $ 500 m for relief , top@@ ping world in funds
japan today promised us $ 500 million to countries devastated by the indian ocean tsu@@ nam@@ is . japan 's contribution by far out@@ pledges all the other countries racing to help victims of one of the world 's worst disasters , increasing the money the world has promised for relief and reconstruction to more than us $ 1.6 billion .
japanese prime minister jun@@ ichiro ko@@ izumi said in a statement that as asia 's largest economy , japan would consider more assistance including money and technology .
" japan will provide assistance to the maximum extent possible in three ways : financial resources , knowledge and expertise , and human resources , " he said .
" for the time being , japan will extend to affected countries and relevant international organizations up to us $ 500 million of grant money as emergency assistance to cope with the disaster , " he said .
ko@@ izumi also said he would take part in a meeting of world leaders on the 6 th in the indonesian capital jakarta to discuss aid for the tsunami - hit countries .

the world health organization ( who ) said today that 50 aid groups had arrived in indonesia 's ace@@ h province to provide medical care for survivors of the tsunami disaster .
the who 's indonesian representative , p@@ eter@@ sen , said the who was trying to coordinate all the groups and had held a meeting with them in the afternoon .
p@@ eter@@ sen said coordination was proving difficult because many groups had gone directly into ace@@ h for relief work .
" we are trying to sort it out , everyone has just come in , but everyone has shown a great willingness to cooperate , " p@@ eter@@ sen said by telephone from jakarta .
p@@ eter@@ sen reiterated that the who 's main concern was to prevent the outbreak of diseases such as cholera and dys@@ enter@@ y , which have the potential to kill tens of thousands of people .
" we are very worried since we have a very large number of people displaced who do n 't have sufficient clean water or adequate food supplies , " p@@ eter@@ sen said .
" so we have a situation that is very ripe for epidemic outbreaks . "
however , p@@ eter@@ sen stressed that there has been no sign yet of any major problems with the diseases .
indonesia 's health ministry says up to 100,000 people in su@@ mat@@ ra may have been killed in the tsunami disaster , with most of the victims in ace@@ h province .

pow@@ ell predicts shi@@ ite victory in ira@@ qi election
us secretary of state col@@ in pow@@ ell today predicted a shi@@ ite victory in the ira@@ qi elections but he also as@@ su@@ aged concerns it could bolster ir@@ anian influence inside the country because of the past fe@@ ud between ira@@ qi and ir@@ anian shi@@ as .
there are growing indications that sun@@ ni ar@@ abs will either boycott the january 30 th election or will be prevented from taking part in it by the ira@@ qi authority due to a spreading insur@@ gency .
" the new government and the transitional national assembly that will come into place will be majority shi@@ ite , " said pow@@ ell on n@@ b@@ c 's " meet the press " .
" the majority of the ira@@ qi population is also shi@@ ite . "
shi@@ ite musli@@ ms make up more than 60 % of iraq 's population , and are concentrated mostly in the southern and central parts of the country .
sun@@ ni ar@@ abs , who live in central and western provinces , comprise about 20 % of all ira@@ q@@ is .
former ira@@ qi foreign minister p@@ ach@@ achi , who now heads the sun@@ ni - dominated ira@@ qi independent democrats party , today called for the vote to be delayed but pow@@ ell said the ira@@ qi election would be held on schedule .
pow@@ ell also said he felt it was unlikely shi@@ ite control of iraq 's future government would mean it would be run from iran .
" my sensing right now is that , even though there may be ir@@ anian influence - and ir@@ an@@ ians will try to influence iraq 's political situation , but there is sufficient difference and past serious dis@@ agreements and conflicts between ir@@ anian and ira@@ qi shi@@ as , " he said .
international aid p@@ ours in but time not on tsunami victims ' side
foreign rescue troops are air@@ dropping food and setting up clean water supplies in asia 's tsunami - hit areas to help millions of victims left homeless and hungry .
statistics show the death toll has reached nearly 150,000 .
donations are flooding in from various governments while us president bush has put his father , ge@@ orge bush , and his predecessor , clinton , in charge of efforts to raise private aid .
a us delegation led by secretary of state pow@@ ell arrived in thailand last night to express us concern and assess the progress of the relief work ahead of a crisis summit on the 6 th in the indonesian capital of jakarta .
pow@@ ell 's delegation includes president bush 's younger brother , fl@@ or@@ ida governor je@@ b bush , and us agency for international development administrator nat@@ si@@ os .
pow@@ ell will head the delegation to inspect the disaster in thailand , indonesia and s@@ ri lan@@ ka before attending the summit on the 6 th .
pow@@ ell said the mission of the visit was to assess the situation " and see what else the us might need to do " , but he was carrying no new immediate promise of aid beyond the 350 million dollars already committed .
since the disaster occurred , there is a voice now to give up the search for thousands of tourists still un@@ accounted for , many of them foreign tourists .
however , thai prime minister th@@ aksin has vowed that the hunt will go on in his country .
" we will continue to use our best efforts as foreign experts have told me that they ( the missing ) may have been buried in mud in mang@@ rove forests . so we will not stop searching , " th@@ aksin told reporters in p@@ hu@@ ket island .
an unprecedented international relief effort is underway .
a fleet of us navy helicopters from the us aircraft carrier lin@@ coln dropped aid and picked up survivors for a second day in ace@@ h of indonesia .
rear adm@@ ir@@ al crow@@ der , commander of the lin@@ coln , says that 50,000 pounds of food and water have so far been delivered to the disaster - hit areas and the operation is " going great " .
tsunami relief efforts mask backstage political wrest@@ ling
with asian tsunami relief materials flooding into disaster - hit areas , behind - the - scene activities are also underway with governments wrest@@ ling over who should offer and receive the aid and who should play a leading role in the largest relief operation in modern history .
the tragedy , which has killed nearly 150,000 people , has re@@ kin@@ dled past flames of war , including the differences between the united states , the united nations and europe as well as the struggle for the leading role in asia .
however , relief experts still hold cautious hopes that given the many countries that have been hit by the tsunami , the tragedy on a global scale may set a precedent for countries that have promised aid to indeed keep their commitments .
" aid commitments by governments have never been 100 % fulfilled in time , " said international development professor jum@@ a of har@@ v@@ ard university 's ken@@ nedy school of government .
governments have already pledged aid of us $ 2 billion . prominent figures in the international political arena including us secretary of state pow@@ ell and un secretary general ann@@ an as well as the leaders of australia , china and japan will hold a crisis summit with deep political implications on the 6 th in the indonesian capital of jakarta .
us president bush increased us aid nearly ten - fold to us $ 350 million after being accused of being slow in response and following senior un relief official eg@@ eland 's open criticism of rich countries ' " st@@ ing@@ iness " .
in asia , the tsunami has resulted in a behind - the - scene wrest@@ le over regional influence . increasingly confident china has promised to offer aid worth us $ 6@@ 0.5 million , a major sum for a developing nation .
japan , which has been reducing its foreign aid for six consecutive years , has shattered remarks that the country 's power is declining with rapid action ; promising to provide at least us $ 500 million , a sum which far out@@ sh@@ ines other nations .

un secretary general ann@@ an said today he wanted to return to s@@ ri lan@@ ka some@@ day to " see all parts of the country " .
ann@@ an ended a two - day tour of tsunami - battered parts of s@@ ri lan@@ ka amid reports the s@@ ri lan@@ kan government had blocked him from visiting rebel - held northern areas .

the abandoned visit of ann@@ an to rebel - held regions has resulted in the indignation of residents of the rebel - controlled northern city of j@@ aff@@ na . hundreds of people staged a protest outside the un office in j@@ aff@@ na .
however , the s@@ ri lan@@ kan government has firmly rejected the media reports , saying they are " misleading . "
on the other hand , as the relief work is in its full swing , s@@ ri lan@@ ka 's weather forecasting authority has warned that s@@ ri lan@@ ka 's cost@@ al lines are likely to be hit by a typhoon currently being formed in coastal waters .
russian space agency denies rocket fuel causes sickness among children
the british weekly science journal nature reports that highly toxic rocket fuel , spe@@ wed out during launches of spacec@@ rafts at russia 's space base in bai@@ k@@ on@@ ur , kazakhstan , is causing serious illness among children living nearby . but the russian space agency has denied the claim today .
the science journal nature report published today quotes a study as saying that levels of end@@ ocr@@ ine disease and blood disorders among residents in the polluted areas are twice the regional average .
the study was conducted by a team of russian scientists led by epidem@@ i@@ ologist zy@@ kov .
the russian space agency responded by saying that " no direct influence of space - related activities on the population 's health has so far been established " .
the study quoted by nature focused on children in the al@@ tai republic .
the al@@ tai republic is located in a mountainous region on the southern fr@@ ing@@ es of si@@ ber@@ ia .
the al@@ tai republic was chosen as the study 's target because of pollution from un@@ burned fuel , notably hy@@ dra@@ z@@ ine .
hy@@ dra@@ z@@ ine is used to power the early stages of some russian laun@@ chers .
zy@@ kov compared the health records of about 1,000 children in two polluted areas between 1998 and 2000 with health records of 3,@@ 300 children from a nearby un@@ polluted control group .
nature reports zy@@ kov has concluded that children in the currently worst - affected areas are up to twice as likely to need medical attention during this time , and need to be treated twice as long .

exports of auto@@ s , consumer goods and food also declined .
japanese defense chief : never forget militar@@ istic history , respect neighboring nations ' dignity
the director general of japan 's defense agency , yo@@ sh@@ in@@ ori on@@ o , said today that even with japan 's high profile in the world , it would not forget its militar@@ ist history and would keep in mind neighboring asian countries ' " dignity " .
asked about concerns likely to rise upon japan sending its self defense forces ( s@@ d@@ f ) to the tsunami - hit areas of south asia , on@@ o said , " when we have contacts with southeast asian countries , we should never forget the past . "
he told reporters , " we must establish a kind of relationship whereby we can tell our friendly neighbors that we are friendly .
when looking back at the past , we should fully respect other countries ' dignity . "
on@@ o specifically talked about this year as marking the 60 th anniversary of the end of the second world war . " we hope we can be re@@ born and cooperate with the new era , " he said .
on@@ o has just concluded a tour of several tsunami - hit south asian countries . he said that when the indonesian leader told him that the relief operation by japan 's s@@ d@@ f should come to an end no later than the end of march , he felt the " dignity " of an independent nation .
the un has expressed its concern over the time limit for foreign troops set by the indonesian government .

political interference in nh@@ k program ? war of words erup@@ ts in japanese media
allegations that the public - owned japan broadcasting cor@@ p . ( nh@@ k ) had been pres@@ sured by politicians several years ago to soft - pe@@ dal a program on japan 's legacy of sexual ens@@ lav@@ ement during world war ii have p@@ itted liberal japanese media against their conservative counterparts .
liberal japanese media have attacked nh@@ k for leaving out large portions of interviews it had conducted with mostly critics of japan 's wartime conduct and victims of sex sla@@ very , allegedly after discussions with senior political leaders .
but conservative newspapers have defended nh@@ k 's editing of the program , saying that nh@@ k executives have a duty to ensure the fairness and objec@@ tiveness of their programs .
the controversy erupted last week over a 2001 program that featured a mock trial on sex sla@@ very of comfort women in the japanese military during the war .
the trial , held by a women 's rights group in tokyo in december 2000 , found the late emperor hi@@ ro@@ hi@@ to guilty of allowing the sla@@ very of comfort women during japan 's occupation of asian nations .
historians say at least 200,000 young women , mostly korean but also from taiwan , china , the philipp@@ ines and indonesia , were forced to serve as comfort women in frontline japanese army bro@@ th@@ els during the war .
the program 's chief producer sat@@ or@@ u n@@ ag@@ ai held a t@@ ear@@ ful news conference on the 13 th noting that just before the program was to be aired senior nh@@ k officials had met with lawmakers of the ruling liberal democratic party , sh@@ in@@ zo a@@ be and sho@@ ichi n@@ ak@@ ag@@ awa , who expressed concerns over the program .
n@@ ag@@ ai said top nh@@ k officials then re - edited and shortened the program .
" nh@@ k b@@ owed to political pressure , " he said .
a@@ be and n@@ ak@@ ag@@ awa admitted meeting with nh@@ k officials and telling them to be " fair " but strongly denied pres@@ suring the broadcaster .
euro@@ zone indicators show core inflation under control
economists said today that euro@@ zone indicators to be released this week would show that core inflation still remains under control .
meanwhile , euro@@ zone industrial output and french consumer spending are both expected to decline .
when the european union 's statistics service releases inflation figures on the 20 th this month , they are expected to confirm that inflation will rise slightly to 2.3 % in december from 2.2 % in november .
but the increase is largely a reflection of tobacco tax increases , and core inflation is expected to remain at 1.9 % .
core inflation figures will be released together with the consumer prices figures .
economists point out that core inflation , which ex@@ cludes food , energy , tobacco and alcohol prices , has remained at a 1.6 - 2 % range for the past two years .
european central bank president tr@@ ich@@ et said on the 13 th that short - term price pressures have diminished recently .
while inflation will remain above 2 % in the coming months , it is likely to fall below this level by the end of the year .
meanwhile , another economist says a weak number is expected to be released for the euro@@ zone 's november industrial output on the 18 th , given recent evidence of weak growth in germany .
german output declined 1.7 % in november and economists pol@@ led by af@@ p 's financial news subsidiary af@@ x news expect euro@@ zone output to fall 0.4 % in november following the 0.5 % drop recorded in october .
sch@@ mi@@ eding of the bank of america says a rebound in euro@@ zone output is likely in december .
bureaucracy hits tsunami refugees twice
three weeks after the strongest tsunami in history , surviving refugees are fighting with bureaucracy and political dom@@ ination while the world 's attention has already been distr@@ acted to other places .
with thousands of dec@@ aying corpses gradually unearthed from the rubble , the death toll of the december 26 th tsunami disaster has exceeded 16@@ 8,000 . meanwhile , the upcoming ira@@ qi election and president bush 's inauguration will replace the tsunami disaster to become the world media 's headline news .
indonesia has back@@ tracked on a demand that foreign troops engaged in humanitarian relief operations will withdraw within 3 months .
in thailand , leaders of canada , sweden , norway and finland are discussing the reconstruction project and efforts to identify the dead .
however , survivors are facing new difficulties . for instance , the deep - rooted bureaucracy in indonesia has hindered the delivery of relief materials pouring in from around the world .
" we are like persons who do not exist . we have been hit hard by the disaster , lost everything and are fam@@ ished , " said bus@@ ri@@ adi , a fisherman from a little fishing village in ace@@ h province 's capital , b@@ anda ace@@ h , on indonesia 's su@@ mat@@ ra island .
he asked , " where are the food , clothes and other relief pouring into ace@@ h as we have seen on television ? "
bus@@ ri@@ adi , like thousands of other refugees , lost his identity cards and other official documents in the tsunami , making his quest for aid a nightmare .
despite be@@ gging officials for help and daily hur@@ rying back and forth going through formalities , the results have always been the same : no aid .
zeng qing@@ hong reportedly paid visit to zhao zi@@ yang before the latter 's death
the hong kong - based china information center for human rights and democracy says vice president zeng qing@@ hong paid a visit to zhao zi@@ yang , the pur@@ ged former general secretary of the communist party of china ( cpc ) , before he died early this morning in a hospital .
the information center has cited zhao zi@@ yang 's family members as saying zeng qing@@ hong visited him at 6 : 00@@ am in a beijing hospital , about one hour before he died at the age of 85 .
zhao zi@@ yang served as cpc general secretary and premier , but was ou@@ sted for opposing the use of military force to suppress the 1989 democratic movement at tian@@ anmen square . he has since been under house arrest and regarded as an unpopular figure by the government .
the information center has cited zhao 's family members as saying the incumbent premier wen ji@@ abao , who used to work for zhao zi@@ yang , had not paid a visit to him when he was seriously ill .
however , before zhao zi@@ yang fell into a coma on the 14 th , tian ji@@ yun , a retired member of the cpc central committee and his former assistant , visited him .
the china information center for human rights and democracy has been in contact with zhao 's family and for years has been releasing accurate news about zhao zi@@ yang at appropriate time .
the information center said some 20 retired senior party , government and military officials planned to write an open letter to the cpc , calling for a re@@ appraisal of zhao zi@@ yang 's contributions and an open memorial service for him .
the information center also said that zhao zi@@ yang 's family will not be allowed to hold or prepare for a funeral , and relevant arrangements will be finally decided by the party .
zhao zi@@ yang 's wife , liang bo@@ qi , is 86 now .
the information center said that due to concerns about her health , she had still not been informed about her husband 's death as of this evening .
zhao zi@@ yang passes away , china urged to move toward democratization
after the former leader of the communist party of china ( cpc ) , zhao zi@@ yang , died of illness today , world figures have highly praised him while japanese prime minister jun@@ ichiro ko@@ izumi , the taiwan government and overseas democratic movement activists have all called on beijing to carry out zhao zi@@ yang 's ideas of democratic reform .
zhao zi@@ yang was dismissed from office for opposing the military suppression of the 1989 democracy movement at tian@@ anmen square . he was put under house arrest and remained so until his death this morning at a beijing hospital at the age of 85 .
ji@@ ji press reported japanese prime minister ko@@ izumi as saying , while mourning for zhao zi@@ yang , that , " i hope they ( china ) are committed to democratization . "
taiwan has also appealed to china to carry out political and democratic reform after zhao zi@@ yang 's death .
chinese overseas democracy movement activists have praised zhao zi@@ yang as " one of china 's greatest reform@@ ers " , who sacrificed his political life in order to oppose the bloody suppression of the democracy movement at tian@@ anmen square .
" during his suffering under house arrest for 15 years , he publicly advocated the need for political reforms and progress towards a government of law and democracy , " said lian sh@@ eng@@ de , once a student movement leader and now president of the new york - based free china movement .
" zhao zi@@ yang will be fon@@ dly remembered as a true democr@@ at and a person of principle . "
some democracy movement activists have requested the chinese government hold a public funeral for zhao zi@@ yang and give fair appraisal to his achievements .
however , they have acknowledged that zhao zi@@ yang will not be offered such courteous service , as the chinese government fears that people who are dis@@ gr@@ un@@ tled with the communist rule will make use of this opportunity to make disturbances .
the 1989 student democratic movement was prompted just by the death of reform@@ ist party leader hu ya@@ ob@@ ang .
xinhua news agency reported briefly today that comrade zhao zi@@ yang died in beijing due to illness , which was the only official announcement on the matter .

however , over 1 billion people in the world live on less than one us dollar and some 2.7 billion people live on less than two us dollars every day . un experts say there is almost no time left for rich countries to fulfill their commitments .
" with the right mobilization of resources and political will , and reform in developing as well as in developed countries , these goals are still achiev@@ able , " said brown , head of the un development program .
un experts say the world 's 22 rich nations have promised to offer 0.7 % of their gross domestic product ( g@@ d@@ p ) to aid developing countries but they are now providing only 0.25 % .

un announces establishment of global disaster warning system
the united nations has announced it will set up a global disaster warning system to predict large natural disasters .
however , differences remain over which country 's technology will be used in the disaster warning system in the wake of the south asian tsunami tragedy .
several un agencies said in a joint statement after a global conference in ko@@ be , japan , that un experts would create a global disaster system to reduce the damage resulting from large natural disasters .

shanghai electric and power station group is china 's largest power station equipment manufacturing base .
over the past several years , due to the rapidly rising demand for power generation equipment in china , power generator manufacturers entered a stage of high growth and great development .
shanghai electric and power station group has combined its advantageous reserve of tur@@ bine generator and power station boiler equipment to win via public bidding the order for manufacturing nine units of heavy - duty gas tur@@ bine generators and 3 exhaust heat boilers after contracting for four 1000 - m@@ w thermal power generation units .

( hong kong , macao and taiwan ) hong kong observ@@ atory offers new services to world meteorological organization 's websites
xinhua news agency report of december 2 nd from hong kong - starting on the 2 nd , the hong kong observ@@ atory ( h@@ ko ) will offer two new services to the world meteorological organization 's websites , the " world weather information service " and the " severe weather information center " .
a spokesman for the observ@@ atory says the two services will offer official weather observations of global cloud cover and rainfall to the " world weather information service " website and a 7 - day review of tropical cyclone movement to the " severe weather information center " website .
the two services follow h@@ ko 's provision of official observation data on worldwide heavy rain ( including heavy snow ) which was offered to the " severe weather information center " website at the beginning of the year .
sources say the " world weather information service " website has been offering official weather forecasts and monthly average cli@@ mat@@ ological data for major cities around the world .
the new service offers official weather observations around the world for the first time , with maps of global cloud cover and rainfall as its primary service items .
the new web pages will cover a wide range of detailed weather observation data with 8 regular updates each day .
the new product for the " severe weather information center " website is a review function of tropical cyclone movement routes .
it was so designed originally that the website would not keep such information as a tropical cyclone 's previous locations after it had disappeared .
however , it has often been the case that the public still want to obtain the relevant data about the tropical cyclone several days after its landing .
to serve this purpose , the new product saves the tropical cyclone 's grades , locations and movement routes for the past 7 days so that the public and the media could still obtain needed data about a tropical cyclone several days after its landing and disappearance .
world 's first bird flu virus h@@ 5@@ n@@ 1 rapid diagnostic kits successfully developed in sh@@ an@@ tou
xinhua news agency report of december 3 rd from sh@@ an@@ tou ( by staff reporters zhang yi@@ wen and lin jun@@ qiang ) - sources from the sh@@ an@@ tou university medical college and the medical school of the university of hong kong 's joint influenza research center say that they have developed the world 's first bird flu virus h@@ 5@@ n@@ 1 rapid diagnostic kits after six months of cooperation with xi@@ amen university .

professor guan yi , director of the sh@@ an@@ tou university medical college and the medical school of the university of hong kong 's joint influenza research center , says that current data shows that the death rate of the deadly infectious bird flu virus is much higher than that of the s@@ ars virus .
previous tests used to take three to five days to ascertain infection and sometimes more than a week .
the successfully developed bird flu rapid diagnostic technology employs the methods of el@@ is@@ a and gold ag@@ glut@@ ination tests to examine such samples as nas@@ al or throat secre@@ tions and chicken embry@@ o culture for whole or split viruses and blood ser@@ um to confirm any infection with the bird flu virus as quickly as within 1 hour or no more than 2 hours .
the new technique is simple , convenient , and easy to apply on the spot in epidemic - stricken areas . it is 90 % accurate and helpful for early discovery , diagnosis , isolation and treatment of the infectious disease to prevent the wide spread of the epidemic and large - scale disaster .
upon the invitation of the china disease prevention and control center , sh@@ an@@ tou university medical college and the medical school of the university of hong kong 's joint influenza research center recently held a training course on bird flu diagnostic techniques , including the latest bird flu rapid diagnostic technique , for personnel from the disease prevention and control centers of 20 provinces and cities across the country .
spokesman for the ministry of foreign affairs commission in hong kong expresses strong dis@@ pleasure with remarks by hy@@ de , chairman of the us house international relations committee
xinhua news agency report of december 3 rd from hong kong - a spokesman for the ministry of foreign affairs commission in hong kong expressed strong dis@@ pleasure on the 3 rd with recent remarks made by hy@@ de , chairman of the international relations committee of the us house of representatives , in hong kong .
the spokesman said the speech in hong kong on the 2 nd by m@@ r . hy@@ de , chairman of the us house of representatives ' international relations committee , was a malicious attack on china 's development and progress as well as a slander on china 's foreign policy evid@@ encing a cold war mentality , with which we are strongly un@@ satisfied .
the spokesman noted that it is known to all the world that china 's development is not only in the fundamental interests of the 1.3 billion chinese people but also beneficial to the world 's prosperity and development .
in the international political arena , china is a responsible country and has been playing an active and constructive role in safeguarding the world 's peace and stability .
on the issue of nuclear non - proliferation , china has always strictly ab@@ ided by relevant international conventions , firmly opposed nuclear proliferation in any form , and insisted on solving such issues through negotiations , talks and the strengthening of international supervision .
the spokesman points out that it is regrettable that m@@ r . hy@@ de has turned a blind eye to the facts and made such extremely irresponsible remarks as sino - us relations are witnessing a healthy and stable development , which completely runs counter to the common grounds on the development of bilateral ties reached recently by heads of states of china and the us , goes against the mainstream voice in us asking to strengthen the cooperative relations with china , and is certainly harmful to the development of sino - us relations .
china 's largest seawater des@@ al@@ ination project to be kicked off in zhou@@ shan
xinhua news agency report of december 6 th from hang@@ zhou ( by pan y@@ ifeng and xu qun ) - china 's largest seawater des@@ al@@ ination project in the mainland so far , with a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons , is to be kicked off in the pu@@ tu@@ o district of zhou@@ shan city in z@@ hejiang province .
for residents in zhou@@ shan long accustomed to water shortages , the seawater surging beside them for hundreds of thousands of years will soon become clean and sweet tap water running into thousands of homes .
according to relevant authorities , a cooperation agreement on a seawater des@@ al@@ ination project with a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons has recently been signed between the hang@@ zhou development center of water treatment technology under the state ocean@@ ic administration and the li@@ u@@ heng township government of zhou@@ shan city .
the project costs 50 million yuan and has a daily production capacity of 10,000 tons of fresh water . it is presently the largest seawater des@@ al@@ ination project in the mainland . the first - stage of construction is expected to be completed next year .
zhou@@ shan is one of chinese cities suffering from a serious water shortage .
the entire city consists of 1,3@@ 90 islands . the per capita fresh water is 60@@ 1 cubic meters , which equals to only 25.@@ 4 % of the per capita average in z@@ hejiang province . the problem of drinking water shortages has long plagued residents of the island city .
taking li@@ u@@ heng township in pu@@ tu@@ o district as an example , some 1,500 tons of fresh water have to be transported every day into the town from a neighboring one at a cost of over 10 yuan per ton .
the technique of seawater des@@ al@@ ination by reverse os@@ mos@@ is , developed by the hang@@ zhou development center of water treatment technology under the state ocean@@ ic administration , is a process of memb@@ rane separation through the driving force of pressure , which at present is a focal point for current global seawater des@@ al@@ ination research .
according to the persons in charge from the center , both the cost and the energy consumption level of the seawater des@@ al@@ ination by reverse os@@ mos@@ is project have been lowered through technological improvement and equipment modifications at home .
the cost of seawater des@@ al@@ ination per ton has further been lowered from the original 5 yuan .

( international ) israel museum 's most precious possession is fake
xinhua news agency report of december 24 th from j@@ er@@ usalem - director of the israel museum , j@@ ames sn@@ y@@ der , said on the 24 th that an ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate , a most precious possession of the museum , had been recently confirmed as a fake .
the ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate was once thought to be the only relic discovered so far of king sol@@ om@@ on time 's first temple .
sn@@ y@@ der said in a statement that the israeli authority had conducted a careful appraisal of the thum@@ b - sized ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate .
experts have found that it is a cultural relic dating to the bronze period , much earlier than the first temple period of the je@@ wish people .
the he@@ brew inscription on the p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate reads : " belonging to the temple of lord je@@ h@@ ov@@ ah , holy to the priests . "
however , the inscription has been confirmed to have been carved to it later .
the ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate was bought from an anonymous collector by the israel museum for $ 5@@ 50,000 in the 1980 s .
archae@@ ologist and antique experts believe that it was a treasure in@@ laid on the top of a scep@@ ter by a priest of the first temple .
sn@@ y@@ der says the ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate was identified as authentic by israeli experts including archae@@ ologist na@@ hman av@@ ig@@ ad before its purchase .
israel 's ha@@ aret@@ z reports that av@@ ig@@ ad authenticated the antique carelessly only with a magn@@ ifying glass .
the claim has been rejected by av@@ ig@@ ad himself .
over the past several months , israeli police has uncovered three large - scale cases of antique forgery successively and summoned hundreds of people for interrogation .
police and the anti@@ quities authority unexpectedly found the ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate was fake during the investigation .
police will indic@@ t some of the people involved in the case next week .
the je@@ wish king of sol@@ om@@ on built the first temple on the holy hill in the 10 th century b@@ c to en@@ shrine holy items such as the ark of the covenant and no@@ ah 's ark , which were later destroyed .
shenzhen to enforce the use of " reclaimed water " in some office buildings and residential quarters
xinhua news agency report of december 26 th from guangzhou - as a major step in building a " water - saving " city , shenzhen will enforce the use of " reclaimed water " in some large buildings and residential quarters . at present , relevant design specifications and regulations for the " reclaimed water " are being drafted .
" reclaimed water " refers to municipal and living wastewater which , after being treated , can reach a certain water standard whereby it can be re@@ used to some extent as un@@ dr@@ ink@@ able water .
its quality is between that of tap water and drainage water .
" reclaimed water " is generally and extensively used for flushing toilets , gardening and farm irrigation , cleaning roads , car w@@ ashes , city foun@@ tains and supply water for cooling equipment .
an survey by the shenzhen water board shows that more than 70 buildings had " reclaimed water " collection systems in shenzhen in the mid - 1990 s . however , due to technology , design and management problems , all the systems were left unused as a result of the excessively high cost of utilizing " reclaimed water " .
only an additional investment of some 300,000 to 400,000 yuan is needed to install " reclaimed water " processing systems in order to bring these pipelines back to work .
it is estimated that if all the existing 70 " reclaimed water " systems were put into operation , 35,000 tons of tap water would be saved in shenzhen each day , based on an average 500 tons of " reclaimed water " to be consumed daily by each residential quarter .
sources say shenzhen 's " reclaimed water " collection work will begin with the renovation of the more than 70 buildings with the original " reclaimed water " systems . it will be further popularized based on the experience from the test - run .
meanwhile , shenzhen 's water resources authorities will join hands with the urban planning and municipal departments to map out " reclaimed water " design specifications and enforce the use of " reclaimed water " in some large buildings .
the treated " reclaimed water " will first be used in city green@@ belt irrigation .

in another report , when talking about the reason why auc@@ tioned assets of yu@@ g@@ ans@@ kne@@ f@@ te@@ ga@@ z would not be included in the assets of gaz@@ pro@@ m , russian industry and energy minister kh@@ rist@@ enko said it was because the nation had already been a majority share - holder of the russian oil and natural gas industrial corporation and the nation did n 't want to increase its overwhelming share .
he said yu@@ g@@ ans@@ kne@@ f@@ te@@ ga@@ z 's assets would be split off and transferred to a wholly state - owned company .

the company holds 65 % of russia 's natural gas reserves .
