ba@@ h@@ rain@@ i princess married us soldier , astonishing 5 - year marriage comes to end
the marriage between ba@@ h@@ rain@@ i princess mer@@ i@@ am al - k@@ hal@@ if@@ a and jo@@ hn@@ son , a us marine , was once widely applauded as a beautiful story by us television stations . the star - crossed marriage , however , lasted only five years and has now come to an end in the desert casino city of las v@@ eg@@ as .
mer@@ i@@ am is a member of the gulf state of ba@@ h@@ rain 's royal family . jo@@ hn@@ son ris@@ ked his military career for this forbidden love . their marriage , resembling a fairy tale , was once the theme of a tv drama .
however , as reported by the las v@@ eg@@ as review - journal , five years have s@@ carc@@ ely passed when the two confronted each other in court as mer@@ i@@ am filed with the court for divorce in las v@@ eg@@ as , where quick marriages but even quicker divor@@ ces are granted .
the pair met in 1999 when jo@@ hn@@ son was still a career military man stationed in ba@@ h@@ rain .
after he met this little princess who is still in her teens , both fell in love with each other , which changed his life tremendously .
since their union was forbidden by the royal family , jo@@ hn@@ son disguised mer@@ i@@ am in a fl@@ annel shirt and a baseball cap and forged her military identification papers , then snea@@ ked her out of her motherland and brought her to the united states .
after a bitter immigration lawsuit with us authorities , the young couple finally got married at the cand@@ l@@ elight wedding cha@@ pel on the las v@@ eg@@ as strip known for its dazzling gran@@ de@@ ur when jo@@ hn@@ son was 23 and the bride was only 19 .
however , jo@@ hn@@ son said that due to temp@@ tations in las v@@ eg@@ as , otherwise known as a " sin city , " his constant tensions with mer@@ i@@ am 's rich and powerful family , and rumors of an assassination plot at his life , this star - crossed marriage eventually failed to survive .
jo@@ hn@@ son said he made a living by val@@ et parking for guests of hotels and cas@@ inos , while mer@@ i@@ am gradually indul@@ ged herself to the night@@ life in the gambling city , frequ@@ enting night@@ clubs late at night without any regard to him as a husband .
mer@@ i@@ am deserted her husband a year ago .
jo@@ hn@@ son said : " she has de@@ graded herself to the bottom . "
euro@@ zone economic indicators this week will show continued weakening of economy in europe
economists said that euro@@ zone economic indicators to be released this week will show further evidence of weak economic confidence and slowing economic output . meanwhile , british data are expected to show an increase in industrial activities .
they said that economic output data from the largest country in euro@@ zone will continue to show dramatic monthly fluctuations , but the long - term trend in economic output will show a slow - down of economic growth .
the most important economic indicator this week will be in germany . the z@@ ew institute 's economic expectations index , closely watched by the market and scheduled to be released on the 7 th , will provide the first proof of economic confidence in europe for december .
the z@@ ew index dropped sharply to 13.@@ 9 in november from 3@@ 1.3 in the previous month .
economists said , as the significant appreciation of the euro will continue to impact the economic confidence in the recent survey , there is no reason to expect any rebound in economic expectations index .
b@@ n@@ p economists said : " considering that major factors driving down economic confidence , including the appreciation of the euro , the uncertainty of global economy and the deteriorating employment rate in the job market in germany , are all burdens on the future growth expectations for the december survey period , a strong rebound in expectations index will be unlikely . "
according to the survey of economists conducted by af@@ x news , af@@ p 's financial news subsidiary , this index will again slip to 11 in december from 13.@@ 9 in the previous month .
but tea@@ ther of u@@ bs investment bank said the german z@@ ew economic expectations index could even drop as low as zero in december .
tea@@ ther said : " in our opinion , expectations of future german economic activities will continue to slip as reflected in the z@@ ew survey of analysts and financial market participants . "
triggering tensions between east and west , crisis in ukraine will become an os@@ ce topic
russia 's repeated allegation about western interference in eastern european affairs has drawn increasing attention due to the political crisis in ukraine and will surely become the major topic at the annual os@@ ce ministerial meeting to be held tomorrow .
western power has gradually penetr@@ ated into some corners of europe originally considered by russia as its back@@ yard , such as the bal@@ tic states , ge@@ or@@ gia and central asia . this has long dis@@ pleased russia . as a result , the recent incident in ukraine will likely become the major topic at the two - day os@@ ce meeting to be held in so@@ fia , capital of bulgaria .
the supreme court in ukraine has made a dramatic ruling , ordering a re - vote for the recent second round of the presidential run - off , while the european union earlier called on the os@@ ce member states to prepare for observers to act " with fastest speed and efficiency . "
sources in europe disclosed that in the run - off scheduled to be re - held on december 26 in ukraine , the number of observers dispatched by the os@@ ce may increase to 1,000 from the previous 600 .
us secretary of state pow@@ ell will attend this os@@ ce annual meeting , on perhaps his last tour before leaving his post .
russian foreign minister lav@@ rov , french foreign minister bar@@ n@@ ier , british foreign minister straw and german foreign minister f@@ ischer will also attend the meeting .
the os@@ ce is made up of 55 countries in north america , europe , and asia , and will celebrate its 30 th anniversary next year .

bush to face big test as intelligence reform bill goes for a vote at congress this week
the intelligence reform bill that us congress will try its best to pass this week marks re@@ public@@ an president bush 's efforts to press his ambitious second - term agenda and the first big test of his support among re@@ public@@ an congressmen after he was re - elected .
ke@@ an , former re@@ public@@ an governor of new j@@ er@@ sey who led the investigation into the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on new york and washington in the united states , said in a newspaper interview yesterday that the problem with the intelligence reform bill lies in its passage by congress . this issue alone did not fore@@ bo@@ de well for the future bi@@ partisan cooperation and the president 's domestic agenda .
ke@@ an said : " if the president and congress cannot get these big issues taken care of , congress will become dys@@ functional and then we 'll all be in trouble . "
he told new york daily news : " we 'll have to wait a long time before another bill can get the support of re@@ public@@ an and democratic leaders in both houses and the support of 80 % of the people in the polls . "
several congressmen said yesterday that if this history - making reform bill fails , it will delay the overhaul of america 's anti@@ qu@@ ated spy network operation by months , even years , or even kill it altogether .
har@@ man , top democr@@ at on congress 's house of representatives ' intelligence committee , said yesterday on c@@ nn television : " if this bill cannot be passed this week , it will be dead before being born . "
congress will make another attempt to pass the " intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of 2004 " on the 6 th and the 7 th before adjour@@ ning till early next year .
if it is not passed , the entire act will be scrapped to be re - drafted in the 2005 congress session .
ukrainian opposition firmly rejects constitutional amendment bill that greatly reduces presidential power
ukrainian pro - western opposition insisted today that the opposition will not accept the constitutional reform pushed forward by outgoing president ku@@ chma before re - holding the second round of the presidential run - off .
this constitutional reform will take away the majority of the current presidential power .
after the supreme court annul@@ led the november 21 election on the grounds that the second - round of election was rid@@ dled with fraud , and the central election commission ordered a repeat run - off on december 26 , the opposition leader y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko again found himself in a stand - off with ku@@ ch@@ man .
y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko 's ally ty@@ mo@@ sh@@ enko said : " if the constitutional amendment bill is passed in its current form , all the presidential power will be transferred to the parliament , which is unacceptable . "
she told reporters : " we hope the president can appoint the director of the intelligence bureau and the prosecutor general so that we can fight corruption and eliminate that bloc that controls the political and business communities in ukraine . "
ku@@ chma , who has close ties with russia , pressed for the constitutional amendment ahead of the repeat run - off for fear that the opposition might win the presidential election .
yesterday opposition parliament members refused to vote on the constitutional amendment bill proposed by the government , which led the parliament to adjourn for ten days .
according to the constitutional amendment bill , except for the prime minister , national defense minister and foreign minister , the power to appoint all other chiefs will be transferred from the president to the parliament where pro - government forces currently have close to a majority .
as set forth in this amendment bill , candidates for the prime minister , national defense minister and foreign minister appointed by the president need to be approved by the parliament , while the parliament can also nominate their candidates .
political crisis in ukraine enters third week as opposition calls for continued protests
the turmoil in ukraine triggered by the presidential election entered the third week as the opposition leader y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko called on masses of supporters today to continue their street protests and blockade the presidential office and government buildings till outgoing president ku@@ chma s@@ acks prime minister y@@ anu@@ kov@@ y@@ ch and his cabinet members and takes actions to ensure the fairness of the upcoming repeat presidential run - off .
tens of thousands of y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko supporters have cong@@ regated in the capital ki@@ ev for two weeks . they block@@ aded the government buildings and cam@@ ped on the main streets specifically designed by russian experts for military parade . the power of people they have demonstrated has forced the supreme court to ann@@ ul the second round of the presidential election held on november 21 , the central election commission to order a repeat run - off on december 26 , and the parliament to approve firing y@@ anu@@ kov@@ y@@ ch . however , ku@@ chma has so far not signed the executive order to remove this successor whom he has nurtured all along .
y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko told the supporting masses that gathered on the capital 's independence square tonight that ku@@ chma should dismiss his government and reorganize the central election commission and that both the parliament and ku@@ chma should agree to amend the electoral law so as to prevent election fraud .
he said in this speech that k@@ icks off the run - off on december 26 : " there should be no talks on removing the blockade of government buildings or the presidential office before these decisions are made .
for fourteen days , this square has shown a love for ukraine and the civic awareness of millions of ukrainian people who can defend their choice . "
he said : " we 're experiencing a struggle between good and evil . the whole world is appl@@ au@@ ding for our victory , and the whole world is proud of ukraine . "
while the opposition increased the pressure on the ruling regime backed by moscow , and y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko and ku@@ chma faced anew a stand - off on constitutional reforms , polish president kw@@ asni@@ ewski , li@@ thu@@ anian president ad@@ am@@ k@@ us , and russian special envoy gr@@ y@@ z@@ lo@@ v are scheduled to arrive in ki@@ ev for another round of mediation .
egy@@ pt announces breakthrough in middle east peace deadlock
egy@@ pt said that the middle east peace agreement is expected to have a new framework .
it also said that it may soon dispatch its ambassador again to israel and restore full diplomatic relations that have been discontinued for four years .
quoting " high - level " egy@@ ptian sources , egy@@ pt 's state - run men@@ a said that all parties seeking a peace plan have come to a consensus on a comprehensive reconciliation .
men@@ a said : " egy@@ pt , israel , palest@@ ine and key international parties such as the united states and the european union have reached an important understanding and agreed in principle to a comprehensive solution to the israeli - palestinian conflict . "
since the palestinian strong@@ man ar@@ afat passed away last month , the international community has resumed pushing for the policy to restore the middle east peace in order to bring an early end to years of bloody conflict between israel and palest@@ ine .
men@@ a said officials expect " preparations will continue into july and then be followed by political actions . "
men@@ a said that afterwards , all parties concerned with the middle east peace process , israel , palest@@ ine , egy@@ pt , the united states , russia and several european countries will hold a meeting in washington .

regarding this issue , men@@ a said , israeli prime minister shar@@ on promised that " as long as the palestinian authority respects the ceasefire agreement and takes good control of its territories , israel will stop military actions against palest@@ inians . "
more than one billion children worldwide rav@@ aged by war , poverty and aids
the un@@ ic@@ ef annual report released today pointed out that more than one billion children , half of the world 's total , are bru@@ tally rav@@ aged by poverty , war and aids .
un@@ ic@@ ef said the rights of children to a healthy and protected up@@ bringing , as clearly laid out in the 1989 convention on the rights of the child , were often imper@@ iled , due in part to the failure of governments to implement human rights and economic reforms .
ms . b@@ ell@@ amy , the un@@ ic@@ ef executive director , pointed out at the annual report launch in london , " when half of the world 's children are growing up in hunger and in unhealthy environment , when schools have become targets of attacks and entire villages are destroyed by aids , we have failed to deliver our promise to children . "
b@@ ell@@ amy added : " too many governments are making deliberate choices that actually harm children . "
the statistical data jointly compiled by un@@ ic@@ ef and researchers from britain 's london school of economics and bri@@ st@@ ol university revealed a hor@@ rif@@ ic picture of children at risk in most part of the world .
researchers found that some 640 million children worldwide lack adequate shelters , 400 million have no access to safe drinking water , 270 million have no healthcare , 140 million ( mostly girls ) have never attended schools .
more seriously , researchers pointed out , at least 700 million children suffer from all sorts of " severe exploitation , " including no access to information and public sanitation facilities .
the tenth annual report released by un@@ ic@@ ef today pointed out that war and aids have destroyed all kinds of networks that normally can protect children and that at times children have become direct victims of war and aids .
eu resists china 's pressure for lifting arms embargo
the european union rejected today the pressure from china 's premier wen ji@@ abao to put a quick end to the arms embargo on china yet said it will work hard toward lifting the 15 - year - old ban .
the nether@@ lands , which holds the european union 's rotating presidency , made the above remark after the eu - china summit .
the nether@@ lands said there should not be any gu@@ esses as to how the european union is going to put an end to the embargo .
the european union imposed the arms embargo on beijing following the massacre in tian@@ anmen square in 1989 .
although the issue of the arms embargo clou@@ ded this china - eu summit , both parties still signed some trade and other agreements at the meeting .
both china and the european union claimed that these agreements have strengthened their mutual " strategic partnership . "
the european union said in a joint statement issued after its summit meeting with china 's premier wen ji@@ abao : " the eu side confirmed its political will to continue to work toward lifting the embargo . "
the statement said the chinese delegation " welcomed this positive signal and believed this signal will benefit the healthy development of the broad strategic partnership between china and the european union . "
wen ji@@ abao made no effort to hide his dis@@ pleasure in a press conference after the summit and said this embargo " does not reflect the partnership between china and the european union . "
wen ji@@ abao said : " this embargo was a result of the cold war . it cannot reflect the current situation , nor can it reflect the partnership between china and the european union . "
led by france , some eu countries are working to have this arms embargo lifted , claiming this embargo is already out of date .
without adding any amendment to strengthen the related eu laws , some wise eu officials are worried that lifting the embargo may open the floo@@ dg@@ ates to arms sales and help enhance china 's military capabilities .
du@@ t@@ ch prime minister bal@@ ken@@ end@@ e said : " i have explained that the european union has the wish to lift the embargo , but i have also made it clear that lifting the ban is closely connected with making adjustment to the code of conduct on arms exports . "
preliminary study yields in@@ conclusive finding that fol@@ ic acid may lead to breast cancer
a latest health study pointed out that " fol@@ ic acid , " a b vitam@@ in widely taken by pregnant women to prevent birth defects , may increase the risk of getting breast cancer .
however , researchers said the result of their study may be merely the result of chance because other studies show fol@@ ic acid can actually reduce the risk of breast cancer . therefore , they urged pregnant women to continue taking this supplement .
fol@@ ic acid , found naturally in dark - color lea@@ fy vegetables , is known in the medical community to provide a key aid in the growth of a f@@ etus .
researchers from the two universities of bri@@ st@@ ol and ab@@ er@@ deen in britain kept track of 3,000 women who , in the 1960 s , either took five milli@@ grams or 0.2 milli@@ grams of fol@@ ic acid or a placebo mostly during the second and third tri@@ me@@ ster of their pregnancy .
the report carried in the british medical journal said that by september 2002 breast cancer rates for the women who took five milli@@ grams of fol@@ ic acid turned out to be twice as high as for those who merely took the placebo .
ness , one of the researchers , stressed that this result was only " preliminary . . . intended to point toward the way toward further research . "
he said : " it is entirely possible that this is a chance result . so further scientific studies are required to examine the association if such an association exists before we reach any conclusion . "
ness said women who are planning to become pregnant should still take the supplement of fol@@ ic acid .
he said " there is a considerable difference between the trial dos@@ age " and the current suggested dos@@ age .
according to the british health guidelines , women hoping to become pregnant and those in the first tri@@ me@@ ster of their pregnancy should take a daily dose of 0.4 milli@@ grams of fol@@ ic acid , more than 10 times smaller than the dose taken by the women in the study .
two candidates of two entirely different m@@ oods in ukraine 's presidential re - run
the two opponents confronting each other in ukraine 's presidential re - run on the 26 th of this month have now read@@ ied themselves for a decisive battle .
pro - western opposition leader y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko is confident of winning the election , while pro - moscow incumbent prime minister y@@ anu@@ kov@@ y@@ ch says he will no longer run on behalf of the " shameful " ruling party .
in the meantime , russia 's president pu@@ tin changed his stance toward ukraine 's eu accession , saying he would be happy to see ukraine join the european union .
asked what percentage of the vote he is expecting to get in the re - run , y@@ ush@@ ch@@ enko said to reporters who packed the conference room : " to be conservative , i should be able to get about 60 % . "
on the other hand , y@@ anu@@ kov@@ y@@ ch , anxiety written all over his face , evaded directly answering reporters ' questions several times and finally said simply : " by god 's will , we will win . "
y@@ anu@@ kov@@ y@@ ch , originally trained by current president ku@@ chma as his successor , has now made a departure , positioning himself as a candidate against both the opposition and ruling parties .
he said , in a manner bor@@ dering on name - calling : " i used to trust those cow@@ ards and tra@@ itors working for the government . now i feel nothing but great disappointment . this government is indeed a shame . "
in an exchange of conditions with the opposition party , ku@@ chma tried to amend laws in order to transfer some presidential power to the parliament so as to end massive opposition protests and political turmoil that have gone on for two weeks since the november 21 presidential run@@ off .
the original winner y@@ anu@@ kov@@ y@@ ch has also had his election inval@@ idated by the supreme court due to the fraud - rid@@ dled voting process and must go through a re - election .

us secretary of state pow@@ ell today held a meeting with top eu officials to offer his final efforts at us - eu solidarity during his term .
the purpose of this european visit by pow@@ ell was to repair diplomatic damage on both sides due to the iraq war . the ha@@ gue was his last stop .
the trip may be pow@@ ell 's last official visit abroad during his term . the european union promised him that it will work toward easing tensions between the two sides before us president bush 's visit to europe next february .
however , differences between the two sides still l@@ inger .
foreign minister bo@@ t of the nether@@ lands , which holds the rotating eu presidency , said : " we must intensify bilateral dialogue during president bush 's second term and re@@ discover our common ground . "
ms . wal@@ d@@ ner , eu external relations commissioner , said she believed europe and the united states have made some progress in " putting the difficult moments of the iraq crisis behind , " but she also acknowledged that now is a " key moment in the eu - us relationship . "
bush will fly to brussels on february 22 next year to meet with eu and nato leaders .
pow@@ ell said bush 's visit is meant to mend f@@ issu@@ res in the relationship caused by the iraq issue .
on his visit to europe , pow@@ ell stopped in so@@ fia and brussels but made only limited progress toward his goal of improving ties .
this was especially the case in brussels , where pow@@ ell criticized six anti - war nato countries for hurting the alliance 's " credibility and solidarity " by refusing to participate in training exercises in iraq .
however , pow@@ ell still insisted his meetings have demonstrated us commitment to fully rehabil@@ itating diplomatic relations .

ol@@ i@@ ver stone wants to seek peace with turkey in spite of lingering dispute over old screen@@ play
movie director ol@@ i@@ ver stone , while promoting his new movie " al@@ ex@@ ander " in ist@@ an@@ bul , tried to take the chance today to make peace with turkey .
his screen@@ play for the classic " midnight express " was criticized for tarn@@ ishing the image of turkey .
in a special interview here he told af@@ p : " it has never occurred to me that this screen@@ play would be against turkey . this screen@@ play is meant to be against injustice everywhere . "
turkey has been den@@ ouncing stone ever since the premier of this award - winning movie in 1978 .
the movie was based on the memoirs of bil@@ ly ha@@ yes .
ha@@ yes , a young american , got arrested at ist@@ an@@ bul airport while trying to smugg@@ le h@@ ash@@ ish from turkey . after a protracted lawsuit , he was sentenced to 30 years in jail in turkey .
turk@@ ish critics accused stone of taking liberties with ha@@ yes 's original work and re@@ writing it as a rac@@ ist screen@@ play in which every turk@@ ish character is , without exception , described as a vil@@ lain .
the movie is also filled with hor@@ rif@@ ic prison scenes of rape and torture .
stone admitted : " perhaps some of the z@@ eal@@ ousness , some of the anger came from being young at that time and trying to make the point too much , too hard . "
but he added : " it was true that bil@@ ly ha@@ yes did get scre@@ wed in the turk@@ ish prison . he was convicted for relatively nothing to 30 years in jail , and he was treated bru@@ tally in prison . so this is all based on facts . "
stone said : " for a larger picture , turkey is not the only country that runs an im@@ perfect prison system . america has similar problems . "
japan 's economy may slow down next year
japan 's economy may slow down in 2005 as a stronger yen and a growing gap between rich and poor may spoil the harmonious atmosphere the country enjoyed in the first half of this year .
after a decade of stag@@ nation , high corporate profits and strong consumer spending have brought confidence back to japan this year , but analysts put their hopes of sustaining economic growth on china despite growing political tensions between japan and china .
the evidence is growing that japan 's economy could suffer a brief downturn in early 2005 , especially if industrial production continues to decline as manufacturers adjust their inventories to avoid a gl@@ ut .
according to a new st@@ ati@@ stic methodology recently adopted , japan 's economy actually sh@@ rank slightly in the april - june quarter and grew only 0.1 % in the july - september quarter , narrow@@ ly escaping a technical recession .
at present , economists still hold very different opinions on the momentum of economic rebound in japan .
b@@ n@@ p par@@ i@@ bas researchers estimated that the actual economic growth in japan can reach 2.3 % for both the current fiscal year ending in march next year and the following fiscal year .
they called 2005 " the year of recovery " on the grounds that the us economy is on a steady recovery track and japan 's consumer spending is making up for slower exports .
in another more pessimistic view , u@@ f@@ j institute economists projected only 1.8 % growth in this fiscal year and even a much slower growth of 0.6 % for the following fiscal year .
they cited the " potential risk , " which means corporate profits do not lead to higher personal incomes .
french foreign minister : middle east peace process will test ties between france and us
after meeting us secretary of state pow@@ ell today , french foreign minister bar@@ n@@ ier said the efforts to revive middle east peace talks will " test " their trans - at@@ lan@@ tic ties .
after the death of the palestinian leader ar@@ afat , france called for an immediate international conference to push for the peace process between israel and palest@@ ine . however , there has n 't been any sign of reaching an agreement after bar@@ n@@ ier and pow@@ ell finished their meeting .
bar@@ n@@ ier flew to washington from paris for a lightning round of talks with pow@@ ell and his internally designated successor , national security adviser rice , before turning around and heading to brussels for an eu summit .
both paris and washington agreed to repair bilateral relations strained by the us invasion of iraq last year , but the two countries still remain very much divided on the resolution to the middle east deadlock .
after a brief talk with pow@@ ell at the us state department , bar@@ n@@ ier said : " we hope to improve future relations between france and the united states , and between europe and america . "
he said : " i think the test at the heart of this relationship . . . is our ability to launch the peace process between palest@@ ine and israel . "
earlier this week bar@@ n@@ ier called for an immediate international conference on the middle east to take advantage of what he termed a " window of opportunity " created after ar@@ afat 's death last month .
but pow@@ ell still did not want to make any commitment .
he said the two had spoken of british plans to hold a meeting participated by palest@@ inians but did not mention whether a broader international conference would be held .
us officials have made it clear that their priority is to promote peace in israel and palest@@ ine and to ensure smooth palestinian elections next month .
the elections will produce a leader who could rein in isl@@ amic militants and revive talks between israel and palest@@ ine .
foreign minister mach@@ im@@ ura proposes japan and south korea hold f@@ ta negotiations next january
japan 's foreign minister no@@ bu@@ tak@@ a mach@@ im@@ ura proposed today that japan and south korea hold negotiations on a free trade agreement ( f@@ ta ) as early as january next year .
according to the report by ji@@ ji press , during a meeting with ban ki - moon , south korea 's minister of foreign affairs and trade , in i@@ bu@@ su@@ ki city of the southern k@@ ago@@ shima county , mach@@ im@@ ura said the two sides should resume the negotiations as early as possible since both tokyo and se@@ oul authorities hope to sign an f@@ ta by the end of 2005 .
before mach@@ im@@ ura 's talks with ban ki - moon , japanese prime minister jun@@ ichiro ko@@ izumi and south korean president ro@@ h mo@@ o - hy@@ un held a summit on the 17 th . during the talks , ro@@ h mo@@ o - hy@@ un urged tokyo authorities to be cautious over imposing economic sanctions against north korea .
as north korea abduc@@ ted several japanese nationals during the cold war , prime minister ko@@ izumi is under tremendous public pressure to punish north korea .
after japanese researchers confirmed last week that the remains provided by py@@ ong@@ yang authorities to prove the death of the two hostages were not the remains of the parties involved , the families of kidnapping victims were outr@@ aged .
apart from the ab@@ duction issue , ko@@ izumi and ro@@ h mo@@ o - hy@@ un agreed that six - party talks aimed at hal@@ ting north korea 's development of nuclear weapons should resume as early as possible .
since north korea 's secret development of nuclear weapons triggered a stand - off in october 2002 , three rounds of six - party talks have taken place but all failed to achieve concrete results .
north korea later boy@@ cot@@ ted a fourth round of six - party talks originally scheduled for september this year .
the six parties for the talks are respectively south korea , north korea , the united states , china , japan , and russia .
thai premier th@@ aksin still expected to win elections in february next year
when thai premier th@@ aksin heads into 2005 , he is confident of winning a second four - year term . however , his reputation has already been tarn@@ ished because he has failed to qu@@ ell a bloody separatist insur@@ gency .
as thailand 's national elections have been scheduled for february 6 next year , th@@ aksin and his political opponents are actively preparing for the elections . in the opinion of most analysts , he is expected to win despite this year 's serious southern violence and epidemic of bird flu .
this year a total of twelve people in thailand died from bird flu , which swept across much of asia but was particularly devastating in thailand . the thai government frankly admitted it " made a mistake " in its handling of the epidemic .
however , this health concern is unlikely to ruin th@@ aksin 's chance of a second term . on the contrary , many people are asking only how extensive his victory will be , and what will his election victory mean to the muslim insur@@ gency in the southern provinces .
k@@ rais@@ ak , chairman of the parliamentary senate 's committee on foreign affairs , told af@@ p : " the phenomenon here is that no matter how you look at th@@ aksin , he has won broad popular support at this moment . "
he said : " but things will start to dis@@ integrate next year , if you look at the accumulation of wealth ( by his family and those close to him ) , the social inj@@ us@@ tices and the violence . "
it is exactly because of social injustice and violence , insur@@ gency broke out in the muslim - dominant deep south of thailand , where spor@@ adic separatist incidents have occurred continuously since january .
since january this year , isl@@ amic rad@@ icals have targeted bud@@ d@@ hists , government officials and security forces in gun battles and they have also carried out bombings and be@@ head@@ ings . as of now more than 560 people have died , and another 100 are missing .
palestinian cabinet secretary claims ar@@ afat was poisoned about a year ago
ab@@ del@@ ra@@ hman , cabinet secretary for late palestinian leader ar@@ afat , disclosed that ar@@ afat was poisoned a year ago when he received a delegation of supporters in his ram@@ al@@ lah headquarters .
ab@@ del@@ ra@@ hman told the al - ha@@ y@@ at newspaper : " about a year ago , something strange happened to ar@@ afat . it was on september 25 , 2003 .
at that time the chairman was shaking hands one by one with some 30 representatives of supporters . shortly afterwards , the chairman started to vom@@ it .
since then the chairman 's health started to deteriorate gradually . "
ar@@ afat died of a mysterious illness in a french hospital on november 11 .
some of palestinian top officials thought ar@@ afat had been poisoned .
however , french doctors said there was no medical basis for such allegations .
two weeks before the delegation visit to ar@@ afat mentioned by ab@@ del@@ ra@@ hman , the israeli cabinet headed by prime minister shar@@ on had just made the decision to de@@ pose ar@@ afat , only without specifying by what means .
this threat from israel prompted a wave of people 's support for ar@@ afat , who subsequently received several delegations of supporters .
ab@@ del@@ ra@@ hman recalled , " ar@@ afat shook hands with these people who came to express their support for ar@@ afat besieg@@ ed by israel . "
on september 25 last year , ar@@ afat received two groups successively . one was a group of cyclists from around the world on a peace mission . the other was a group of political activists .
ab@@ del@@ ra@@ hman pointed out , " october 12 this year was the last time when ar@@ afat got ill . the symptoms were the same , vomiting , lack of appetite and all the similar symptoms of having the flu . "
bush admits need to step up training for ira@@ qi troops and vigorously def@@ ends rum@@ s@@ feld
us president bush admitted today that ira@@ qi troops are not yet ready to replace us troops and warned that the elections scheduled for january 30 next year would not spell the end of serious violence in iraq .
in an - hour - long press conference , bush also expressed his support for defense minister rum@@ s@@ feld , insisting the p@@ ent@@ agon chief was " doing a really fine job . "
bush said , despite some sharp dis@@ agreements sometimes , he vowed to continue working with russian president pu@@ tin . he also said that now is the time to make progress toward ending the middle east conflict .
he also believed that the best way to deal with surviving " axis of evil " members iran and north korea is to go through multilateral diplomacy .
after yesterday 's successive car bombings killed 66 people and injured more than 200 in the two ira@@ qi isl@@ amic shi@@ ite pilgrimage cities of na@@ j@@ af and kar@@ bal@@ a , bush admitted frankly that violence was taking its toll on ira@@ qi people but insisted the elections in january must take place as scheduled .
bush warned americ@@ ans that iraq 's elections " are just the beginning of a political process " and cautioned that " i certainly do n 't think the process will be trouble - free . "
bush also acknowledged that training ira@@ qi security forces had mixed results .
he said : " sometimes when fighting intensified , they ( ira@@ qi troops ) would desert the battlefield . "
he said this kind of ira@@ qi troops will never be able to protect the national security , which is unacceptable .
however , he believed that after a long period of training by us troops , the training of ira@@ qi troops will achieve results .
white house : ira@@ qi insurg@@ ents ' attempt to sabotage elections is doomed to fail
in response to insurg@@ ents ' attack on a dining hall in a us military base in the major city of mo@@ sul in northern iraq at noon today that killed 22 us and ira@@ qi soldiers and injured more than 60 , the white house spokesman mc@@ cl@@ ell@@ an said there will be more rampant terrorist activities by ira@@ qi insurg@@ ents as ira@@ qi elections approach , but these " enemies of freedom " will be surely wiped out .
reports from iraq said that a single massive explosion occurred at no@@ on@@ time in a us military base dining hall when officers and soldiers were eating , resulting in heavy casualties .
the ira@@ qi provisional government set january 30 for the first elections since the down@@ fall of the hus@@ sein regime .
the united states has sent nearly 20,000 additional troops to ensure security in iraq during the elections .
the total number of us troops in iraq during the elections will reach 150,000 .
m@@ cl@@ ell@@ an said as the elections approach , hus@@ sein loy@@ alists and insurg@@ ents will create more terrorist attacks in an attempt to sabotage the interim government . they want to go back to the past but " they will be wiped out , and they are being wiped out . "
re@@ acting to a latest poll which shows 56 % of americ@@ ans think the iraq war " is not worth fighting , " 57 % dis@@ approve the way president bush is handling the situation in iraq , and 52 % think defense minister rum@@ s@@ feld should step down , m@@ cl@@ ell@@ an said president bush will not dance attendance on polls .
" polls are mom@@ entary numbers , while we continue to do our job based on the progress we made in iraq . "
crowds of mour@@ ners attend funeral for philipp@@ ine politician po@@ e
a large crowd of fil@@ ip@@ ino movie fans attended today 's funeral for po@@ e , the country 's most famous movie star . the ceremony was conducted under tight security for fear of unrest .
po@@ e , 65 , had un@@ successfully run for president .
a crowd of mour@@ ners escorted the coffin carrying po@@ e 's body as it was pulled through the streets of the capital of man@@ ila on a carriage drawn by two white horses .
an army of riot police was deployed around mal@@ ac@@ an@@ ang palace to prevent violence from po@@ e supporters .
these supporters had accused president ar@@ royo of cheating in the may 10 presidential election .
the military also raised its alert level due to intelligence reports about an imminent coup to overthrow ar@@ royo and replace her with roc@@ ess , po@@ e 's surviving widow .
however , the funeral procession ended peacefully . movie fans shouted out the letters f@@ p@@ j , the initi@@ als of po@@ e 's name , and waved his campaign posters .
po@@ e died of a stroke on december 14 .
as the hear@@ se wound its way toward the cemetery , weeping women and children tos@@ sed flowers at the coffin .
following justice secretary gon@@ z@@ ales 's warning that some people might take advantage of the funeral to make trouble , large freight containers were placed as road blocks around mal@@ ac@@ an@@ ang palace close to the funeral procession route .
gon@@ z@@ ales said that " reliable intelligence reports " indicated a plot to use the occasion of the funeral procession and inter@@ ment to incite people against the government .
however , l@@ t . col . pas@@ c@@ ual , a military spokesman , said that the political coup had apparently dissip@@ ated after the military deployed troops to guard key areas .
ar@@ royo later walked out of mal@@ ac@@ an@@ ang palace to greet the military police who were guarding the area .
sy@@ ria must cooperate with us on issue of israel and le@@ banon , arm@@ itage warns
us deputy secretary of state arm@@ itage issued warnings to sy@@ ria today , saying the development of future relations between dam@@ asc@@ us and washington depends on whether sy@@ ria wants to cooperate with the united states on the issues of iraq and le@@ banon .
arm@@ itage renewed greater pressures on sy@@ ria when he was interviewed by reporters from arab countries .
the interview was released earlier by the state department .
asked whether he expected continued tensions between the united states and sy@@ ria , arm@@ itage replied : " i certainly hope the relations will be improved , but this depends on how ( sy@@ rian president ) al - ass@@ ad and his men behave . "
the us state department number two pointed out that dam@@ asc@@ us should implement the un security council resolution 15@@ 59 passed in september this year and end as soon as possible all interf@@ erences in its neighboring country le@@ banon .
arm@@ itage said sy@@ ria 's behavior was " not a defiance of the united states but a defiance of the entire international community . "
reporters asked again whether the united states will raise the issue of sy@@ ria 's refusal to cooperate when the un security council discusses whether un peacekeeping troops should remain in le@@ banon in january next year . to this , arm@@ itage replied : " we 'll very likely do that . "
speaking of the iraq issue , arm@@ itage acknowledged that dam@@ asc@@ us had indeed taken some steps that met us expectations by reinforcing joint border patrols with iraq and hal@@ ting insurg@@ ent funding .
however , he also said that sy@@ ria " still needs to make greater efforts . "
ait and tec@@ ro sign lease today for new building site in ne@@ i@@ hu
the american institute in taiwan ( ait ) and the tai@@ pei economic and cultural representative office ( tec@@ ro ) signed a lease today for a new building site in ne@@ i@@ hu . dou@@ glas pa@@ al , director of the ait tai@@ pei office , said the new building is now being designed , and that he hopes it will be completed soon so the institute 's work can be done in a safe and modern facility .
dou@@ glas pa@@ al and tec@@ ro secretary general jo@@ hn chen signed a 99 - year lease for the new ait office building site at noon in tai@@ pei 's chun yue hotel .
witnesses were d@@ avid ke@@ eg@@ an , deputy director of the ait tai@@ pei office , and j@@ acqu@@ eline liu , deputy secretary general of tec@@ ro . minister of foreign affairs mark chen was also present for the ceremony .
ait , established under the taiwan relations act to handle unofficial civil exchanges between the united states and taiwan , has offices in tai@@ pei and k@@ ao@@ hsiung .
dou@@ glas pa@@ al said in his speech that ait has been working with tec@@ ro and the tai@@ pei city government for over a decade to find a new ait office building site .
he said the current office at hsing yi road looks sha@@ b@@ by and lacks enough space .
for ait , relocating to the new office building will be a challenge , as it will be able to consolidate offices currently scattered throughout tai@@ pei to operate in a safe and modern facility .
he said the new building is currently being planned and designed in a way that he hopes will add features to taiwan 's architecture and become a point of pride for tai@@ pei residents .
upon completion of the planning and design , contract bidding will be set for construction , which will begin right after the contractor has made its decision . it is hoped that ground@@ breaking will take place within the next few years .
ait spokeswoman d@@ ana shell - smith said the building 's cost , including the site lease and architectural design , is estimated at about us $ 160 million . its completion in 2008 depends on many factors , though it is hoped to be done as quickly as possible .
thousands of pilgrims rush to attend ch@@ rist@@ mas eve mass in be@@ th@@ le@@ h@@ em
thousands of pilgrims are gathering in the west bank town of be@@ th@@ le@@ h@@ em for ch@@ rist@@ mas eve mass .
in the meantime , pl@@ o mainstream group al fat@@ ah is expected to have defeated ham@@ as in yesterday 's local palestinian elections .
regarding violence and conflict , a gun battle broke out between israeli troops and palestinian gun@@ men in ga@@ za , resulting in the deaths of three young palest@@ inians .
israeli settlers , on the other hand , block@@ aded a main road in protest against mortar attacks on their settlement .
also , pl@@ o leader ab@@ bas was allowed to travel to the west bank town of be@@ th@@ le@@ h@@ em . it was the first time in the past four years that israeli authorities allowed a key palestinian leader to attend ch@@ rist@@ mas celebrations there .
late palestinian leader ar@@ afat was a regular guest at the midnight mass in be@@ th@@ le@@ h@@ em following his return to the palestinian area in 1994 . but since early december 2001 , ar@@ afat had been confined to his ram@@ al@@ lah headquarters by israeli troops .
the l@@ atin patri@@ arch sab@@ b@@ ah of j@@ er@@ usalem left that city in early afternoon for his traditional trip to be@@ th@@ le@@ h@@ em 's m@@ anger square , where thousands of ch@@ ris@@ tian pilgrims and muslim spectators had long been cong@@ reg@@ ating .
sab@@ b@@ ah was scheduled to address thousands of pilgrims at church of the n@@ ativity midnight mass .
by noon , m@@ anger square was packed with a continuous stream of pilgrims to@@ ting s@@ anta cla@@ us ballo@@ ons entering and leaving the church of the n@@ ativity . outside the church , a ch@@ rist@@ mas tree was f@@ est@@ o@@ oned with various lights and decorations .
israeli authorities eased travel restrictions in a special effort to make it convenient for ch@@ ris@@ tians from the ga@@ za strip , the west bank , and israel to attend ch@@ rist@@ mas eve mass in be@@ th@@ le@@ h@@ em .
pu@@ tin claims taking over main asset of yu@@ k@@ os was for protecting national interest
russian president pu@@ tin said today that russia was protecting its national interest by its acquisition of the main asset of russia 's oil giant yu@@ k@@ os , a first move of re - nation@@ alization in the post - soviet era .
referring to ros@@ ne@@ ft 's acquisition of yu@@ g@@ ans@@ kne@@ f@@ te@@ ga@@ z , a yu@@ k@@ os subsidiary , pu@@ tin said at the end - of - year press conference held in the k@@ rem@@ lin : " russia is now protecting the national interest by using absolute legal market mechanism .
and i consider this perfectly normal . "
ros@@ ne@@ ft today has become the new owner of yu@@ g@@ ans@@ kne@@ f@@ te@@ ga@@ z after acquiring bai@@ k@@ al@@ fin@@ ans@@ group which won yu@@ g@@ ans@@ kne@@ f@@ te@@ ga@@ z earlier at a secre@@ tive auction .
earlier last midnight ros@@ ne@@ ft announced unexpectedly that it had acquired 100 % of shares of the previously unknown bai@@ k@@ al@@ fin@@ ans@@ group .
the acquisition allows k@@ rem@@ lin to have a tight control of russia 's critical energy sector .
for nearly 18 months in the past , russian authorities had been attacking yu@@ k@@ os and its imprisoned billi@@ on@@ aire founder k@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky .
since ros@@ ne@@ ft is merging with gaz@@ pro@@ m , combined with yu@@ g@@ ans@@ kne@@ f@@ te@@ ga@@ z , the consolidated trio will control one fifth of russia 's total oil output and all its natural gas production to become the world 's largest energy group .
pu@@ tin justified the state 's current acquisition by criticizing the under - the - table privatization in the 1990 s .
the privatization measures at that time caused the crown je@@ w@@ els of the russian economy to fall into the hands of a few slic@@ k businessmen such as k@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky .
bai@@ k@@ al@@ fin@@ ans@@ group earlier won the controlling rights to yu@@ g@@ ans@@ kne@@ f@@ te@@ ga@@ z by offering us $ 9.@@ 35 billion for the bid .

un : relief supplies weeks away for ace@@ h survivors
the united nations said today that it will take " weeks " for urgently - needed relief supplies to reach tsunami survivors in the isolated areas of indonesia 's ace@@ h province .
us navy helicopters have arrived today in b@@ anda ace@@ h , capital of ace@@ h province . meanwhile , more and more field hospitals have started operating in the city and large shipments of relief supplies are arriving at the airport .
however , el@@ m@@ qu@@ ist , the chief of the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in indonesia , told reporters that a host of coordination and infrastructure problems made it impossible for a prompt delivery of relief supplies .
after returning to the capital jakarta from b@@ anda ace@@ h , el@@ m@@ qu@@ ist told reporters over the phone : " it will take us weeks before we can deliver relief supplies to all the isolated areas . "
he said : " this is a serious concern . we are trying all we can to find ways to establish an aid distribution system in b@@ anda ace@@ h . "
the united nations and other relief organizations have warned that people in the affected su@@ mat@@ ra area in indonesia may die within a few days if they cannot immediately get clean drinking water , food , and medical treatment .
asked whether delays in delivery mean death sentences for some tsunami survivors , el@@ m@@ qu@@ ist replied : " i hope not . i hope survivors can manage to find food and drinking water , but this is certainly not the situation we would be happy to see . "
he said : " this is a very serious situation . we can only hope that it is possible to speed up the operation . "
japan tops world donors with pledge of us $ 500 million in relief aid
japan pledged us $ 500 million in relief aid today to countries devastated by the massive tsunami in the indian ocean . while all nations compete with one another in offering aid to survivors of the most le@@ thal catastrophe in the world , this contribution not only made japan the top donor of all nations but also raised the money hitherto pledged by the international community for relief and reconstruction to a total of us $ 1.6 billion .
japanese prime minister jun@@ ichiro ko@@ izumi said in a statement that japan , as the largest economy in asia , will consider providing more assistance including money and technology .
he said : " japan will try to its maximum capacity to provide assistance in three ways : financial resources , knowledge and technology , and human resources . "
he said : " japan will , for the time being , first provide a grant of us $ 500 million to affected countries and relevant international organizations as emergency aid to cope with the disaster . "
ko@@ izumi also said that he will attend the meeting of world leaders to be held on the 6 th in the indonesian capital of jakarta to discuss assistance to tsunami - stricken countries .
after us president bush was accused of being slow to respond to this human catastrophe , the us government increased its pledge of aid ten@@ fold to us $ 350 million yesterday .
china , which is seen as increasingly challenging japan 's influence in asia , has also promised us $ 6@@ 0.5 million in aid , a huge sum for a developing nation .
ko@@ izumi said : " japan will mobilize fire department helicopters and personnel to make further contribution .
japan will also consider providing more assistance , as soon as possible , including mobilizing japan 's self - defense forces aircraft , ships and personnel . "
japan previously pledged us $ 30 million in aid to tsunami - stricken countries .
a foreign ministry spokesperson said that ko@@ izumi 's pledge of us $ 500 million also includes that amount of us $ 30 million .
who : 50 organizations to provide medical aid to ace@@ h in indonesia
the who said today that 50 aid groups have arrived in the indonesian province of ace@@ h ready to provide medical assistance to tsunami survivors .
who representative in indonesia p@@ eter@@ son said that the who is trying to coordinate all groups and has held a meeting with them this afternoon .
p@@ eter@@ son said the coordination is challenging as many groups have gone directly to ace@@ h to administer relief .
in a telephone interview in j@@ ar@@ k@@ ata , p@@ eter@@ son said : " we are trying to sort things out . every group has just arrived , yet each has also expressed their willingness to work together . "
p@@ eter@@ son reiterated that the who is mainly concerned with preventing outbreaks of such diseases as cholera and dys@@ enter@@ y , which can cause deaths by tens of thousands .
p@@ eter@@ son said : " we are very worried because we have many displaced people , who do n 't have adequate clean water or appropriate food .
so we have all the conditions necessary for an outbreak of epidemic . "
however , p@@ eter@@ son stressed there has n 't been any sign yet of these diseases .
indonesian health ministry said the death toll in su@@ mat@@ ra during the tsunami may be as high as 100,000 with most of the victims in the province of ace@@ h .
since most of the medical facilities have been destroyed in the province of ace@@ h , indonesian military , singapore , and australian government have set up at least eight field hospitals in the past week . the un@@ ic@@ ef has also started to distribute basic medical kits to assist 200,000 children .
pow@@ ell predicts shi@@ ite victory in ira@@ qi elections
us secretary of state pow@@ ell today predicted a shi@@ ite victory in the upcoming ira@@ qi elections , but he also believed there should not be too much concern that the shi@@ ite victory may increase ir@@ anian influence because there are past dis@@ agreements between ira@@ qi and ir@@ anian shi@@ as .
there has been growing evidence that sun@@ ni musli@@ ms may boycott the elections on january 30 or may be prohibited from participating in the elections by the relevant ira@@ qi authorities due to their spreading of insur@@ gency .
pow@@ ell said on n@@ b@@ c 's meet the press program : " the new government going into power and the transitional national assembly will be majority shi@@ ite .
the majority of ira@@ qi population is also shi@@ ite . "
shi@@ ite musli@@ ms make up more than 60 % of iraq 's population , living mostly in southern and central areas .
on the other hand , sun@@ nis live in central and western provinces and comprise 20 % of the population .
former foreign minister p@@ ach@@ achi , who now heads the sun@@ ni - dominated " ira@@ qi independent democrats party , " called today for postp@@ oning the elections , but pow@@ ell said the ira@@ qi elections will go ahead as scheduled .
pow@@ ell also said he did not think shi@@ ites ' control of the future ira@@ qi government could mean iran would manipulate the political situation in iraq .
he said : " my feeling now is that even if there might be ir@@ anian influence - - iran will , of course , try to influence the political situation in iraq , but there are quite significant differences and past serious dis@@ agreements and conflicts between ir@@ anian and ira@@ qi shi@@ as . "
time is running against tsunami victims as international relief aid p@@ ours in
foreign troops on relief mission are dropping food from helicopters in areas hit by the asian tsu@@ nam@@ is and setting up drinking water distribution systems to assist millions of displaced and fam@@ ished tsunami survivors .
according to statistics , the death toll has climbed to nearly 150,000 .
relief supplies from governments keep coming in while us president bush put his father , bush senior , and former president clinton in charge of efforts to raise private donations .
in the meantime , the delegation led by us secretary of state pow@@ ell arrived in thailand last night to show us concern and assess the progress of relief efforts before they head off to a crisis summit to be held in the indonesian capital of jakarta on the 6 th .
pow@@ ell 's delegation includes president bush 's brother je@@ b bush , governor of fl@@ or@@ ida , and nat@@ si@@ os , administrator of us agency for international development .
pow@@ ell , heading the delegation , will tour thailand , indonesia , and s@@ ri lan@@ ka to inspect the disaster devast@@ ation before attending the summit on the 6 th .
pow@@ ell said the mission of his delegation is to assess the disaster situation and " see what else the united states needs to do , " but there will be no immediate promise of additional aid beyond the us $ 350 million already committed .
as days went by after the disaster , there are talks now of giving up the search for thousands of tourists not yet accounted for . many of them were foreign tourists .
but thai premier th@@ aksin vowed to continue the search in his country .
th@@ aksin told reporters on p@@ hu@@ ket island : " foreign experts told me they ( the missing ) might have been buried in mud in mang@@ rove forests . we will continue the search by all means and will not stop . "
the international relief effort of the largest scale in history is still underway .
navy helicopters dispatched from the us aircraft carrier " the lin@@ coln " have been on their mission to drop relief supplies and pick up survivors in the indonesian province of ace@@ h for a second day .
rear adm@@ ir@@ al crow@@ der , commander of the lin@@ coln , said 50,000 pounds of food and water had so far been delivered to affected areas and the operation was " going smoothly . "
behind tsunami catastrophe relief efforts lies political jo@@ stle
as asian tsunami disaster relief supplies continuously poured into affected areas , a less prais@@ e@@ worthy operation is also secretly underway : governments are jo@@ st@@ ling over who should be giving money , who should be receiving aid and who should be leading this relief operation of the largest scale in modern times .
the catastrophe that has killed nearly 150,000 people has re@@ kin@@ dled the old fire of war , including the dis@@ cord among the united states , the united nations and europe , and the struggle for leadership in asia .
relief experts , however , are still hoping with caution that the global nature of this tsunami catastrophe that devastated so many countries might lead to another precedent : governments that promised to provide aid will actually honor their words .
jum@@ a , professor of international development of har@@ v@@ ard 's ken@@ nedy school of government , said : " promises of aid made by governments have never been carried out 100 % and on time . "
with pledged donations from governments hitting us $ 2 billion , major players in the international political arena including un secretary general ann@@ an and us secretary of state pow@@ ell , and leaders from australia , china and japan will hold a crisis summit with strong political over@@ tones in j@@ ar@@ k@@ ata on the 6 th .
after accusations of a slow response and top un relief official eg@@ eland 's public criticism of rich countries for " being st@@ ing@@ y , " us president bush raised us aid nearly ten@@ fold to us $ 350 million .
in asia , the tsunami catastrophe triggered a secre@@ tive jo@@ stle for regional influence as an increasingly confident china pledged us $ 6@@ 0.5 million in aid , an impressive big sum for a developing country .
japan , which has cut down foreign aid budget for six straight years , also quickly deb@@ un@@ ked the notion that its national power is declining by v@@ owing to provide at least us $ 500 million in aid , a sum putting all other nations to shame .

us president bush said today that he was " deeply heart@@ ened " by the high turnout for today 's palestinian elections and pledged to step up us peace efforts .
bush said in a statement : " palest@@ inians throughout the west bank and the ga@@ za strip took a key step toward building a future democracy by choosing a president of the new self - rule government through elections .

ann@@ an 's plan to visit rebel - controlled areas in s@@ ri lan@@ ka blocked
un secretary general ann@@ an said today that he hopes to be able to return to s@@ ri lan@@ ka some day to " visit every part of the country . "
ann@@ an recently ended his two - day visit to tsunami - hit areas in s@@ ri lan@@ ka . however , reports said that the s@@ ri lan@@ kan government had tried to block him from visiting rebel - controlled northern areas .
asked at a press conference whether the s@@ ri lan@@ kan government had blocked him from visiting rebel l@@ t@@ te ( liberation tigers of tam@@ il e@@ el@@ am ) controlled areas , as reported by many national newspapers , ann@@ an said : " i hope i can return to visit every part of the country and assist in accelerating the peace process . "
ann@@ an said president k@@ um@@ ar@@ at@@ ung@@ a had personally objected to his on - site visit to guerrilla - held areas because she feared the rebels might use his visit as a political bargaining chip .
he said : " i brought up the issue of the peace process and the need to intensify peac@@ em@@ aking efforts .
i also discussed the issue with president k@@ um@@ ar@@ at@@ ung@@ a . "

us trade deficit in november hit us $ 60 billion , setting highest record in history
us department of commerce announced data today that us exports sh@@ rank 2.3 % in november last year , driving trade deficit to a new historic high of us $ 6@@ 0.3 billion .
while us exports plummeted to a new five - month low of only us $ 9@@ 5.6 billion , imports grew 1.3 % to a new all time high of us $ 15@@ 5.8 billion as the bill for us oil imports increased by 1.3 % , or more than us $ 2 billion to us $ 14.@@ 2 billion .
trade deficit increased 7.7 % from the adjusted us $ 56 billion in october last year , a dramatic increase of 5@@ 0.8 % from the us $ 40 billion in november 2003 .
according to a survey conducted by c@@ bs market@@ watch , wall street economists predicted the trade deficit on goods and services will shrink to about us $ 5@@ 3.3 billion .
although a weaker dollar makes us products relatively cheaper both at home and abroad , the us trade deficit continues to widen .
the report by the department of commerce today will put pressure on the us dollar and renew calls for washington to do something about the us energy independence and the trade imbalance with china .
us exports slipped last november due to a decrease of us $ 1.4 billion in capital goods exports , including a us $ 325 - million drop in aircraft and aircraft engines exports .

exports of automobiles , consumer goods , and food also declined .
japan defense agency chief : will not forget militar@@ ist past and will respect the dignity of neighboring countries
japan defense agency chief yo@@ sh@@ in@@ ori on@@ o said today that japan will not forget its militar@@ ist past and will carefully keep in mind the " dignity " of neighboring countries as it takes a higher international profile .
asked about possible concern over japan 's dispatch of its self - defense forces to areas hit by south asian tsu@@ nam@@ is , on@@ o said : " when we get along with southeast asian countries , we should never forget " the past .
he told reporters : " we must build a relationship with our friendly neighbors , which allows us to tell them we mean well .
looking back on the past , we should fully respect the dignity of other countries . "
noting this year marks the 60 th anniversary of the end of world war ii , on@@ o said : " we hope to be re@@ born and will cooperate for the new era . "
on@@ o has just concluded his tour of several countries hit by south asian tsu@@ nam@@ is . he said he could feel the " dignity " of an independent country when the indonesian leader told him japan 's self - defense forces should complete their relief mission by the end of march at the latest .
the united nations has expressed concern over the deadline the indonesian government imposed on foreign troops .
foreign troops were well credited for delivering relief to tsunami survivors in the most remote areas .
nearly 1,000 japan 's s@@ d@@ f troops are on their way to the countries hit by the december 26 tsunami , a natural catastrophe that killed more than 16@@ 3,000 people .
this is the largest deployment of japan 's self - defense forces since the end of world war ii .
the us - directed japanese post@@ war constitution stipulates that the self - defense forces cannot use force .
controversy broke out in japan 's media over alleged political interference in nh@@ k program
the allegation that the public japan broadcasting cor@@ p ( nh@@ k ) was pres@@ sured by politicians to delete part of a program on japan 's military draft of women as sex slaves during world war ii a few years ago has p@@ itted liberal japanese media against their conservative counterparts .
it was alleged that nh@@ k took out most portions of interviews after its discussion with top political leaders . liberal media criticized nh@@ k for what it did since the majority of those interviewed were critics of japan 's wartime conduct and victims of forced sex sla@@ very .
however , conservative newspapers defended nh@@ k 's decision to e@@ dit the program , believing the company 's senior executives were oblig@@ ated to ensure the fairness of the program content .
the controversy broke out last week over a program aired in 2001 that featured a mock trial on the crime the japanese military committed in drafting women as sex slaves .
the trial , held by a women 's rights group in tokyo in december 2000 , found late japanese emperor hi@@ ro@@ hi@@ to guilty because he allowed japanese military to draft women as sex slaves during the japanese occupation of asian countries .
historian said at least 200,000 young women were forced to serve as sex slaves in frontline japanese military bro@@ th@@ els during the war . they were mostly from south korea but some of them also came from taiwan , china , philipp@@ ines and indonesia .
the program producer sat@@ or@@ u n@@ ag@@ ai held a t@@ ear@@ ful press conference on the 13 th to disclose the fact that right before the program was aired , nh@@ k senior officials had met with the ruling liberal democratic party lawmakers sh@@ in@@ zo a@@ be and sho@@ ichi n@@ ak@@ ag@@ awa , who had expressed concern over the program .
according to n@@ ag@@ ai , nh@@ k senior officials later re - edited and shortened the program .
he said : " nh@@ k b@@ owed to political pressures . "
a@@ be and n@@ ak@@ ag@@ awa admitted meeting with nh@@ k officials and telling them to be " fair " but strongly denied pres@@ suring the company .
euro@@ zone data to show core inflation under control
economists said today that euro@@ zone economic data to be released this week will show core inflation is still under control .
in the meantime , euro@@ zone industrial production and french consumer spending are both expected to decline .
the euro@@ st@@ at is expected to confirm that inflation rate will rise slightly from 2.2 % in november to 2.3 % in december when it releases inflation data on the 20 th of this month .
however , the increase is mainly a reflection of tobacco tax increases , and core inflation is expected to remain at 1.9 % .
core inflation figures will be released together with consumer prices figures .
economists pointed out that core inflation , which ex@@ cludes prices of food , energy , tobacco and alcohol , has stayed at the range of 1.6 % and 2 % for the past two years .
european central bank president tr@@ ich@@ et said on the 13 th that short - term price pressures have diminished recently .
although inflation will remain above 2 % for the coming few months , it may decline by the end of the year .
meanwhile , another economist said that given the slowing growth in germany , euro@@ zone industrial output expectations for november to be released on the 18 th are also expected to decline .
german industrial output declined 1.7 % in november , while a survey of economists conducted by af@@ p 's subsidiary af@@ x news shows that euro@@ zone industrial output will fall again by 0.4 % in november after a drop of 0.5 % in october .
sch@@ mi@@ eding of bank of america said that a rebound in euro@@ zone industrial output expectations is likely in december .
tsunami victims hit anew , this time by bureaucracy
three weeks after suffering the strongest tsunami attacks in history , survivors are now gr@@ appl@@ ing with the v@@ ices of bureaucracy and politici@@ zation , while the world 's focus has shifted elsewhere .
thousands of dec@@ aying bodies continue to be dug out from debris , pushing the death toll of the december 26 tsunami catastrophe to more than 16@@ 8,000 . in the meantime , the upcoming ira@@ qi presidential elections and bush 's inauguration ceremony have replaced the tsunami disaster as the world media 's top headline news .
indonesia has re@@ tr@@ acted its original demand that foreign troops involved in humanitarian aid missions withdraw within three months .
in thailand , leaders from canada , sweden , norway , and finland are discussing reconstruction and efforts to identify dead bodies .
however , survivors are facing new difficulties , such as indonesia 's deep - rooted bureaucracy , which has impeded the distribution of relief supplies pouring in from all over the world .
in a small village near b@@ anda ace@@ h , capital of ace@@ h province on the indonesian island of su@@ mat@@ ra , fisherman bus@@ ri@@ adi said : " it seems like we do not even exist . the tsunami hit us very hard . we have lost everything and we are star@@ ving . "
he said : " where are the food , clothing , and other relief supplies we saw on tv pouring into ace@@ h ? "
like thousands of other disaster victims , bus@@ ri@@ adi lost his identity card and other official documents due to the tsunami , which turned his efforts to get relief supplies into a nightmare .
although he has been be@@ gging officials and shut@@ tling daily from one place to another to process paper@@ work , the result is always the same : no relief aid for him .
zeng qing@@ hong said to have visited zhao zi@@ yang before his death
the hong kong - based information center for human rights and democracy in china said that before ou@@ sted former cpc secretary general zhao zi@@ yang died of illness this morning , china 's vice president zeng qing@@ hong visited him in the hospital .
the information center said that according to zhao zi@@ yang 's family , zeng qing@@ hong visited him at 6:00 this morning in a beijing hospital before his death about an hour later . zhao was 85 .
formerly cpc secretary general and premier , zhao zi@@ yang was ou@@ sted because he opposed the military crackdown on the tian@@ anmen square democratic movement in 1989 . he had been under house arrest since then and had lost favor within the government .
the information center said that according to zhao 's family , wen ji@@ abao , incumbent premier who used to work under zhao zi@@ yang , did not come to visit him when he was critically ill .
however , before zhao zi@@ yang fell into a coma on the 14 th , he was visited by tian ji@@ yun , the retired party central committee member who once worked as his assistant .
the information center for human rights and democracy in china has been in regular contact with the zhao family and has released accurate information about zhao zi@@ yang at opportune times for many years .
the information center said that some twenty key retired officials from the party , the government , and the military plan to issue a public letter to the cpc calling for a re@@ evaluation of zhao zi@@ yang 's contributions and demanding a public memorial service for him .
the center added that zhao zi@@ yang 's family will not receive permission to host or prepare a funeral . the final decision on relevant arrangements will be made by the party .
liang bo@@ qi , zhao zi@@ yang 's wife , is 86 .
the information center said that due to her poor health , she was not informed of her husband 's death until the evening .
china widely urged to push for democracy in the wake of zhao zi@@ yang 's death
while the world lavis@@ h@@ ed praise on former cpc leader zhao zi@@ yang after his death from illness today , japanese prime minister jun@@ ichiro ko@@ izumi , the taiwan government , and overseas chinese democracy campaig@@ ners all urged beijing to push for democratic reforms en@@ visi@@ oned by zhao zi@@ yang .
ou@@ sted in 1989 for his opposition toward the military crackdown on the tian@@ anmen square democratic movement , zhao zi@@ yang spent the rest of his life under house arrest and passed away in a beijing hospital this morning . he was 85 .
according to ji@@ ji press , japanese prime minister ko@@ izumi said in memory of zhao zi@@ yang : " i hope they ( china ) make efforts toward democratization . "
taiwan also urged china to push for democracy and political reforms after the death of zhao zi@@ yang .
overseas chinese democracy campaig@@ ners praised zhao zi@@ yang as " one of the greatest reform@@ ers in china " who sacrificed his political life in opposing the bloody crackdown on the tian@@ anmen square democratic movement .
lian sh@@ eng@@ de , president of the new york - based free china movement and former student movement leader , said : " during the 15 years of his house arrest , he openly advocated the need for political reforms and progress toward rule of law and democracy .
zhao zi@@ yang will be fon@@ dly remembered by later generations as a true democr@@ at and a man of principle . "
some democracy activists are demanding that the chinese government hold a public funeral for zhao zi@@ yang and make a fair evaluation of his contributions .
however , they admit the un@@ likelihood of zhao zi@@ yang receiving such treatment because of chinese government 's fears that a public dissatisfied with the cpc ruling will take advantage of the occasion to create unrest .
as it was , the 1989 student movement was triggered by the death of reform@@ ist leader hu ya@@ ob@@ ang .
a brief report released by xinhua news agency today that comrade zhao zi@@ yang had died of illness in beijing was the only related official statement .
un : rich nations fail to honor pledge to reduce poverty
a panel of un - appointed experts said in a new report that the rich nations that promised to deliver financial aid to hal@@ ve extreme poverty worldwide by 20@@ 15 have so far failed to honor their pledge .
wealthy nations around the world have promised to participate in " millennium development goals , " an ambitious un program , to improve the lot of the world 's poor and suffering .
however , as more than one billion people worldwide are living on less than a dollar a day , and 2.7 billion more are surviving on less than two dollars a day , the un experts said there is n 't much time left for rich nations to live up to their promises .
director brown of the un development program said : " with the right mobilization of resources and political will , and reforms in developing countries as well as in developed countries , these goals are still achiev@@ able . "
the un experts said that 22 rich nations worldwide pledged to provide 0.7 % of their gross national product in aid to the developing countries , but they have so far only provided 0.25 % .
un secretary general ann@@ an commissioned the development experts led by former har@@ v@@ ard economist s@@ ach@@ s@@ the to compile this progress report on meeting the goals , which include wiping out extreme poverty , making primary education universal , cutting child mortality rate , and fighting aids and other deadly diseases .
the report said : " the practical solutions exist . the political framework is established . and for the first time , the cost is affordable . all that is needed now is action . "

the severe damages caused by south asia 's massive tsu@@ nam@@ is in@@ fur@@ i@@ ated all the indian ocean nations .
director br@@ ic@@ en@@ o of the international strategy for disaster reduction said : " the new program will bring peace and safety to mankind .
an effective early warning system will ensure the lives and safety of millions of people in all parts of the world . "

the un@@ es@@ co is spear@@ heading the establishment of a global disaster warning system .
b@@ ernal , head of un@@ es@@ co 's inter@@ governmental ocean@@ ographic commission , said : " at present , several countries have made different proposals . so we need to make coordination and cooperation efforts . "

this successfully developed quick technique for bird flu virus testing uses an en@@ zy@@ me - linked immun@@ os@@ or@@ bent ass@@ ay and a gold - based di@@ p@@ stick . specimens able to be tested include excre@@ tions , nas@@ al or throat secre@@ tions , whole or split virus cultured in a chicken embry@@ o , and ser@@ ums . a conclusion about bird flu infection can be reached in as fast as one hour , and at most within two hours .
the new technique is simple , convenient , and fast . the test can be performed at the site of an outbreak with over 90 % accuracy . it can aid the early detection , diagnosis , quarantine , and treatment of the infectious virus , and thereby prevent widespread outbreak and consequent heavy casualties .
entrusted by china 's center of disease prevention and control , the joint influenza research center of the sh@@ an@@ tou university and the university of hong kong medical schools recently held a training workshop on bird flu virus testing and trained staff from centers of disease prevention and control in 20 provinces and cities throughout the country . this latest bird flu quick testing technique was included as part of the program .

xinhua news agency , hong kong , december 3 a spokesperson for the office of the special commissioner of the ministry of foreign affairs in hong kong spoke on the 3 rd to express great dissatisfaction with the recent speech in hong kong by hy@@ de , chairman of the us house committee on international relations .
the spokesperson expressed strong dissatisfaction with the speech delivered on the 2 nd in hong kong by hy@@ de , chairman of the us house committee on international relations , for his vicious attacks on development and progress in china and his cold war - style def@@ iling of china 's foreign policy .
the spokesperson said it is commonly known that china 's development not only serves the basic interests of the 1.3 billion chinese people , but also supports worldwide prosperity and development .
on the international stage , china is a responsible nation and has played an active and constructive role in maintaining world peace and stability .
on the issue of nuclear non@@ proliferation , china has always strictly observed relevant international conventions and firmly opposed nuclear proliferation in any form . china maintains that such issues should be resolved through negotiation , dialogue , and strengthened international monitoring .
the spokesperson said that while china - us relations are making healthy and steady progress , it was regret@@ ful that m@@ r . hy@@ de ignored objective facts and made these extremely irresponsible remarks . these remarks , totally inconsistent with consensus on the development of bilateral relations reached by chinese and us presidents recently , run counter to the mainstream voice of the us community for strengthened cooperation with china and are undoubtedly harmful to the development of the china - us relationship .

there are 1,3@@ 90 islands of various sizes within the city . fresh water per capita is 60@@ 1 cubic meters , which is only 25.@@ 4 % of the average fresh water per capita in z@@ hejiang province . water supply has always been a problem in the life of this island city 's residents .
in pu@@ tu@@ o district 's li@@ u@@ heng township for example , 1,500 tons of fresh water have to be shipped daily from a neighboring town at the cost of more than ten yuan per ton .
the reverse os@@ mos@@ is seawater des@@ al@@ in@@ ization technology developed by the hang@@ zhou water treatment technology development center under the state ocean@@ ic administration is a pressure - driven memb@@ rane separation process , currently a hot subject in international seawater des@@ al@@ in@@ ization research .

the cost of seawater des@@ al@@ in@@ ization treatment has been further reduced from 5 yuan per ton .
this reduction indicates that the cost of seawater des@@ al@@ in@@ ization may be expected to approach the prices of running water and industrial water .

construction of three gorges project underground power station to begin soon
xinhua news agency , wu@@ han , december 8 ( reporter shi yong@@ feng ) on december 8 , the first public bidding was held for the principal part of the yang@@ tze three gorges project underground power station , kicking off construction of the three gorges underground power station .
the three gorges project design calls for the installation of 26 700 - m@@ w water tur@@ bine generating units , for a combined capacity of 18,@@ 200 - m@@ w , which upon completion will generate 8@@ 4.7 billion kw@@ h of electricity annually .
in order to further tap the power generation potential of the three gorges project , the preliminary design of the project reserved space for expanding the underground power station .
according to an executive with china yang@@ tze river three gorges project development corporation , the three gorges underground power station is to be set in the mountain on the right bank of the three gorges dam , with its principal construction including intake tower , diversion tunnel , principal plant building , tail@@ race system , bus shaft , and 500 k@@ v trans@@ former sub@@ station .
six 700 - m@@ w generating units will be installed in the underground power station .
thus , the total number of generating units installed in the three gorges project will be increased from the originally planned 26 to 32 , while installed generation capacity will rise to 2@@ 2,@@ 400 - m@@ w from 18,@@ 200 - m@@ w , significantly boosting the three gorges project power generation capacity .
flood control was the primary objective for construction of the three gorges project .
according to the three gorges reservoir operation coordination plan , the water level of the reservoir will be lowered from the normal pool level of 175 meters to the flood control level of 145 meters prior to the annual flood season .
therefore , construction of the underground power station will increase water utilization in the three gorges reservoir , reduce the amount of unused water , and enhance power generation capacity , maxim@@ izing the periods of peak calibr@@ ation when no water goes unused .
currently , ground@@ breaking has already started for the branch tube , the tail@@ race , the support structure , and other preliminary projects for construction of the three gorges underground power station .
sources said that the underground power station will be completed and put into operation by the end of 2008 .
china ready to establish a sailing festival
xinhua news agency , beijing , december 8 ( reporter huang fu@@ hui ) yao ming@@ de , chairman of the china road transport association , said at a press conference held here on the 8 th that he is " full of confidence " for establishing a china sailing festival .
yao ming@@ de , who also heads the organizing task@@ force office for commemorating the 600 th anniversary of zheng he 's western seas voyage , said that 16 member departments of the organizing task@@ force , including the ministry of communications , have reached consensus on establishing july 11 of each year , the day zheng he made his first western seas voyage , as china 's sailing festival , and will make a proposal to the state for establishing this festival .
sources said the state council approval is needed to establish non - holiday festivals .
zheng he was a world - renowned navig@@ ator .
during the 28 years from 14@@ 05 to 14@@ 33 , zheng he led a fleet of more than 200 ships and nearly 30,000 people on a succession of seven long sea voyages , sailing through southeast asia , the indian ocean to arrive at the red sea and africa . his journey covered over 300,000 kilometers and included stops in more than 30 countries and regions in asia and africa .
china will host a series of events next year to commemorate the 600 th anniversary of zheng he 's western seas voyages .
the logo for the commemorative events was revealed in beijing on the 8 th .
the logo comprises a sail@@ boat bra@@ ving the wind and waves as it s@@ ails west , a light blue bil@@ low@@ y ar@@ ching wave , and the text " 600 th anniversary of zheng he 's western seas voyage ( 14@@ 05 - 2005 ) . "
it was designed by yao ying , an art teacher in a junior high school in xi 'an , sha@@ anxi province .
people from all walks of life have urged that a china sailing festival be established in 2005 to coincide with the 600 th anniversary of zheng he 's western seas voyage , and to use the opportunity to educate youngsters , thus enhancing public awareness of sailing and maritime concepts , passing down the spirit of the chinese nation , and deepening patriotic education .
yao ming@@ de said that china has over 3 million square meters of sea territory and that 90 % of china 's goods in the international trade is transported by sea .
as china is one of the world 's large maritime nations , lack of a sailing festival among its various holidays does not make sense .
taiwan province has already established july 11 as sailing festival day .
sailing festivals are celebrated in about a dozen nations throughout the world , including the united states , canada , and japan .

( international ) israel museum 's prized possession found to be a forgery
xinhua news agency , j@@ er@@ usalem , december 24 j@@ ames sn@@ y@@ der , director of the israel museum , said on the 24 th that the museum 's prized possession , the ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate , has recently been identified as a forgery .
this ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate was once considered the only arti@@ fact ever discovered of the first temple in sol@@ om@@ on 's time .
sn@@ y@@ der said in a statement that israeli authorities conducted a meticulous examination on the thum@@ b - sized ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate .
experts found it should be a relic of the bronze period , dating back much earlier than the time of the first je@@ wish temple .
a line of he@@ brew inscription on the p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate read : " belonging to the temple of the lord ( y@@ ah@@ we@@ h ) , holy to the priests . "
however , the inscription was identified as being later added .
the israel museum bought the ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate from an anonymous collector for us $ 5@@ 50,000 in the 1980 s .
arche@@ ologists and arti@@ fact experts used to believe it was a treasure embedded by the first temple priest in the top of a scep@@ ter and also the only relic left from that period of time .
sn@@ y@@ der said that prior to the purchase , the ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate was authenticated by the israeli archae@@ ologist na@@ hman av@@ ig@@ ad and other experts .
according to the report by israel 's newspaper ha@@ aret@@ z , av@@ ig@@ ad ran a cur@@ sory examination of the relic using only a magn@@ ifying glass at that time .
av@@ ig@@ ad himself denied this allegation .
in recent months , israeli police uncovered three large - scale anti@@ quity frauds in succession and questioned hundreds of people .
during the investigations , the police and the anti@@ quities authority discovered by chance that the ivory p@@ ome@@ gran@@ ate was a forgery .
the police will indic@@ t some of the parties involved next week .
in the 10 th century b@@ .@@ c . , the je@@ wish king sol@@ om@@ on built the first temple on today 's temple mount to store the sacred objects like the ark of the covenant and no@@ ah 's ark , which were later destroyed .
shenzhen to mandate use of " reclaimed water " in some complexes and residential sub@@ districts
xinhua news agency , guangzhou , december 26 in a major effort toward building a " water - saving " city , shenzhen will mandate the use of " reclaimed water " in some comparatively large complexes and residential sub@@ districts . relevant guidelines and regulations on water reclamation design are currently being formulated .
" reclaimed water " mainly refers to non - drinking water derived from treated urban waste water and domestic sewage , meeting certain water quality standards and re@@ usable within a certain range .
its quality is between that of running water and sewage .
in general it is used in large volume for flushing toilets , irrig@@ ating gardens and farmland , cleaning roads , washing cars , providing water for city foun@@ tains , and as supplementary water for cooling equipment .
according to an investigation by the shenzhen municipal water administration , more than 70 complexes in shenzhen were equipped with " reclaimed water " recycling systems during the mid-@@ 1990s , but the construction firms had to abandon their use due to the high costs of recycling and utilizing " reclaimed water " associated with the technology , design , and management .
to put these pipelines into actual use , it needs only an additional investment of 300,000 yuan to 400,000 yuan to install a " reclaimed water " treatment system .
based on daily usage of 500 tons of " reclaimed water " by each residential sub@@ district , shenzhen could save 35,000 tons of running water per day using the 70 - plus existing sets of " reclaimed water " pipelines .
sources said that shenzhen 's " reclaimed water " recycling project will start with the renovation of the 70 - plus complexes that were originally equipped with " reclaimed water " recycling systems . further promotion will be based on assessment of feed@@ backs .
in the meantime , the shenzhen municipal water administration will work with city planning and construction departments to develop guidelines as soon as possible for water reclamation design and to mandate the use of " reclaimed water " in some comparatively large complexes .
the treated " reclaimed water " will be first used to irrig@@ ate urban green@@ ery .

it is also reported that while talking about the reason why the auc@@ tioned yu@@ g@@ ans@@ k assets will not be incorporated into gaz@@ pro@@ m 's corporate assets , russia 's industry and energy minister kh@@ rist@@ enko said on the same day that it was largely because the state is already the major shareholder of gaz@@ pro@@ m and does not want to add more to its controlling shares .
he said the yu@@ g@@ ans@@ k assets will be separated individually and transferred to a completely state - owned company .
on the 19 th of this month , russia 's federal property fund held a public auction of 7@@ 6.@@ 97 % equity of yu@@ g@@ ans@@ kne@@ f@@ te@@ ga@@ z , the largest subsidiary of the oil firm yu@@ k@@ os . the newly organized bai@@ k@@ al@@ fin@@ ans@@ group won the bid with us $ 9.@@ 35 billion .
